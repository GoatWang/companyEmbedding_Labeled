Digital Ally's stock rockets after 'significant' patent win against Axon
Shares of Digital Ally Inc.  rocketed 62% toward a five-month high in premarket trade Friday, after the maker of video surveillance products announced a "significant" victory in its patent battle with Axon Enterprises Inc. , which was formerly Taser International. Digital Ally said the U.S. Patent Office denied Axon's petition for inter parties review (IPR) of Digital's patent, as the petition did not establish a "reasonable likelihood" that Axon would prevail. The patent in question covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices when a law enforcement vehicle's light bar is activated. "We look forward to restarting our patent infringement litigation in U.S. District Court against Axon, which had been stayed pending the Patent Office IPRs," said Digital's Chief Executive Stanton Ross. "We will now take the necessary actions to move to a trial where a jury can finally end Axon's willful infringement and assess damages due to us." Digital's stock had tumbled 23% year to date through Thursday, while Axon shares had edged up 3.3% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.6%.

Digital Ally's stock rockets after 'significant' patent win against Axon
Shares of Digital Ally Inc.  rocketed 62% toward a five-month high in premarket trade Friday, after the maker of video surveillance products announced a "significant" victory in its patent battle with Axon Enterprises Inc. , which was formerly Taser International. Digital Ally said the U.S. Patent Office denied Axon's petition for inter parties review (IPR) of Digital's patent, as the petition did not establish a "reasonable likelihood" that Axon would prevail. The patent in question covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices when a law enforcement vehicle's light bar is activated. "We look forward to restarting our patent infringement litigation in U.S. District Court against Axon, which had been stayed pending the Patent Office IPRs," said Digital's Chief Executive Stanton Ross. "We will now take the necessary actions to move to a trial where a jury can finally end Axon's willful infringement and assess damages due to us." Digital's stock had tumbled 23% year to date through Thursday, while Axon shares had edged up 3.3% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.6%.

Nugent · 2017年4月17日Very poor experience from this poorly ran organization.  We have tried the body cameras (they do not work), we have DVM 400's and DVM 800's units and they too d⋯⋯o not work properly.  Problem after problem and we have lost evidence because of their poor products.     When we call the tech support office, we are met with friendly staff who are obviously not adequately trained to troubleshoot the issues with such a poor product.  I feel bad for their ground level employees, as they must certainly be frustrated with the lack of leadership within this organization.   This company is more focused on playing golf and marketing themselves to "help" first responders.  The poor service starts with customer care and their unwillingness to do the right things for his customers.  Take a moment to Google this company and their fiscal problems before you spend a single moment with "Customer Care Manager."    Several employees that proved to be the most helpful, no longer work for this company.  You have to wonder why.  Still waiting on return calls and emails. 更多Jason Frank · 2017年2月25日We are the premier installers for digital ally cameras in NJ and NY and PA and if you have any issues or need them installed, please contact us.   Honestly my p⋯⋯olice dept has these in all our cars and they work great. I really think as long as everyone is trained properly in how to use the cameras, you have zero issues.   We have installed them in police cars and ambulances and they are a great product! 更多Tyler Sewald · 2016年12月20日We have two of these in car systems in our patrol vehicles.   The older product works much better than the new one.   The new system stopped working within 6 mo⋯⋯nths of installing it.   They sent replacement parts which corrected the problem for a few months.   Now it's not working again.  I called and emailed to file a warranty claim.   They responded AFTER the warranty expired and refused to honor the claim.   When I asked about the possibility of sending the unit back and paying to upgrade to a better model they told me they would give me a credit of 25% for it.   Come to find out the system they sold us is exactly the same price of the newer model.   Very poor customer service.   Now I have to answer for the grant money spent to purchase this piece of crap.  Save your money. 更多Jason McConnehey · 2016年11月29日If the product worked on a consistent basis, then I would give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, there is ALWAYS something wrong with the product.  I have no experien⋯⋯ce with their body worn camera's, but I'm not impressed with the in-car cameras.  There is always something wrong, either on the software side or the hardware side.  Other departments in the area use another brand that is much more stable. It's not as fancy as the Digital Ally, but the other brand works when you need it to work.  Even our installer (which covers most  of the Bay Area) doesn't like this product very much. 更多Robert Cox · 2016年7月25日Body cams quit working after one day. In car cams quit working in a short period of time. Was originally told it was a software issue. Body cams were returned t⋯⋯o company and when we got them back, the same thing happened, quit working after one shift. Company representative refuses to return calls or emails. Three other agencies having the same issues with the equipment and service. 更多Courtney Forster · 2015年12月4日My husband  is an employee with Digital Ally! They are such an amazing company! I know because my husband is constantly coming home and telling me how much he l⋯⋯oves working here! Not to mention he gets to play a big role in protecting our officers and officers all over the world! What an honor! As a wife of a wonderful husband and 4 beautiful boys it's great and relieving to have a happy husband in the evennings and to hear about relationships that are being made! Thank you Digital Ally for blessing our family, and for what you do! We appreciate you! 更多Jean-Pierre Dupuis · 2015年1月9日Value: Value is a measure of a stock's current worth. DGLY has a current Value of $2.75 per share. Therefore, it is overvalued compared to its Price of $14.69 p⋯⋯er share. Value is computed from forecasted earnings per share, forecasted earnings growth, profitability, interest, and inflation rates. Value increases when earnings, earnings growth rate and profitability increase, and when interest and inflation rates decrease. VectorVest advocates the purchase of undervalued stocks. At some point in time, a stock's Price and Value always will converge. 更多Jeff Mikesell · 2015年3月20日Tried to use the system, called customer support, and they said it was too close to him to go home, and wanted me to call back on a Monday. Spoke to LJ, and he ⋯⋯was much less than helpful. I would NOT purchase this product due to the fact it is complicated to install the software, and they have zero customer service.  I would look at the body camera Taser International sells, they have friendly and helpful tech support. 更多Mike Odom · 2013年7月15日These guys make some great products, "worth their weight in gold" as a Dallas County, MO deputy told me.Jared Walker · 2014年9月19日Very nice equipment..

Good job Kansas City Missouri Police Department!還有 24 張Sierra Moore 新增了 24 張相片和 4 段影片 — 與 Ashly Marie Rooks 。 · 6月3日 · 美國 Missouri 堪薩斯城 · Way to make a 3 year olds dream come true. I came over to my friend Ashlys and her 3 year old niece was sitting there selling lemonade. She bought a police offi⋯⋯cer outfit with her lemonade money eairler and said "I just wanna be a cop". So ashly and I sat there and we were trying to think of ways to get a police officer to come here. First I was like let's go to the station then someone said call a non emergency number. So while Ashly called I made the first post and then Ashly posted on swap and shop.  We never thought this would happen. Whenever the first officer came out Hannah was so happy and we just wanted at least one to stop by. Well all of a sudden more and more started to come out. we have had sheriff's, police officers, k-9 units, swope park officers came with horse's, we are even having a helicopter fly over. This made not only this little girl happy but us happy as well. Thank you for everyone who shared our post and help made this happen. We had at least 50 plus police officers here. shout out to Jessi Martin and sargent Jason cote for making this happen and to everyone else who shared the post and also helped make this happen. I just can't say thank you enough. 更多Digital Ally, Inc. · 5月29日 · Today we honor the men and women who sacrificed their lives serving our country.  #MemorialDayDigital Ally, Inc. 分享了 Lenexa Police Department 的貼文。 · 5月16日 · Thank you to all police officers past and present. #NationalPoliceWeek還有 6 張Lenexa Police Department 新增了 9 張相片。 · 5月15日 · This morning we took a moment to remember those officers who gave their life in service.

Announces 2016 Operating ResultsMarketwiredMarch 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLENEXA, KS--(Marketwired - Mar 27, 2017) - Digital Ally, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  DGLY ), which develops, manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement, homeland security and commercial applications, today announced its operating results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT tomorrow, March 28 2017 (see details below).Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2016 We expanded our addressable market outside of law enforcement with the award of several large orders involving our in-car event recorder and body camera products to non-law enforcement customers during 2016. These orders demonstrate the importance of our solution to meet customer demands and our flexibility to adapt our hardware and software to handle unique requirements for a variety of industries and applications.  We introduced several new cloud-based and other recurring service offerings to our product suite, including our revamped VuVault.com cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the FleetVU Manager, our driver management, training and asset tracking cloud systems for non-law enforcement customers. Our FleetVu Manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters, such as speed, hard braking, geo-fencing and erratic turns, all of which are automatically uploaded to FleetVuManager.com without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events. These recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us. Service and other revenues increased 35% during 2016 compared with 2015.   We recently released our new DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which provides the first full HD quality in-car video system available on the market. The DVM-800 HD is the new standard in high definition 1080p in-car video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point.   During 2016 we were awarded a contract for the sale of FirstVu HD body-worn cameras to a non-law enforcement international customer. The three-year supply contract includes our FirstVu HD body-worn cameras, storage systems and an extended service agreement. The revenue from the initial orders delivered in 2016 exceeded $760,000 with additional service revenues of $180,000 expected for 2017 through 2019. Our international revenues increased to $1,191,012, representing 7% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $148,667, representing 1% of total revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2015.   In December 2016, we completed a private placement of $4.0 million in principal amount of 8% secured convertible debentures and warrants exercisable to purchase 800,000 shares of common stock at $5.00 per share to two institutional investors. This private placement resulted in gross proceeds of $4.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction which totaled $281,570. We are using the net proceeds for general working capital purposes and to continue to execute our business plan.  During 2016 we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors, Taser International, Inc. and Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a as WatchGuard Video. We have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented "auto-activation" feature embodied in our VuLink product. We believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers. Law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the ground-breaking nature of our "auto-activation" patents and are demanding this technology. We believe that Taser and WatchGuard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions. We will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that Taser and WatchGuard have willfully infringed our patents. Further, we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for body-worn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future.  During 2016, we encountered excessive rework costs for our products due to nonrecurring supply chain issues with certain of our contract manufacturers. The supply chain issues have been corrected; however, the effects of these issues impacted our revenues and gross margins for 2016. Total revenue decreased by 17% to approximately $16.6 million in 2016, compared with approximately $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit margin decreased to 32% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 42% in 2015.   The Company reported an operating loss of ($12,486,188) for the full year of 2016 compared with an operating loss of ($7,621,471) in the previous year. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was ($4,013,995) compared with ($2,700,529) in the prior-year period.   A net loss of ($12,710,688), or ($2.38) per share, was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a net loss of ($12,037,892), or ($2.77) per share, in 2015.   On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded an adjusted net loss of ($10,273,557), or ($1.92) per share, in 2016 compared with a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($5,448,791), or ($1.26) per share in the year ended December 31, 2015.   Management Comments"We were disappointed to report revenues for the year ended 2016 that decreased 17% from the year prior, even though we saw an increase in our service-based revenues in 2016," stated Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally Inc. "We are concentrating on expanding our recurring service-based revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis. We are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers. If successful, we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in 2017 and beyond. We are testing a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings, including the long-term lease of our body-worn and/or in-car audio/video hardware, together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage, search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material. We believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers, in particular our commercial and other non-law enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment, data storage and management services." "We recently announced the launch of the DVM-800 HD in-car video system, which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel. The DVM-800 HD system provides full 1080P high definition video at a cost effective price point, which is a competitive market advantage for us.""Our international revenues increased to $1,191,012 in 2016 compared to $148,667 during 2015 and were aided by approximately $760,000 of revenue from the sale our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended service agreement to a non-law enforcement international customer that will continue for three years. This order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our FirstVU HD body cameras globally across various industries and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement market.""We entered 2017 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which should be able to support a higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming," added Ross. "Unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2016, and we had approximately $11.7 million in net working capital available at the end of 2016, including $2.5 million of accounts receivable and $9.6 million of inventory. Our goal is to reduce inventory levels during 2017 to provide additional funding for operations," concluded Ross.2016 Operating Results For the year ended December 31, 2016, our total revenue decreased by 17% to approximately $16.6 million, compared with revenue of approximately $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by Taser's misleading press release regarding our patents, the reexamination of our patent commenced by Taser with the USPTO and our product quality control issues with our FirstVU HD product. In addition, we believe that Taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper, unethical and unfair competition. We expect FirstVU HD sales to recover during 2017 as we prosecute the patent lawsuits against Taser, WatchGuard and others and resolve our product quality issues. We believe the VuLink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented "auto-activation" technology.International revenue increased to $1,191,012 in 2016, versus $148,667 in 2015. Our 2016 revenues were aided by approximately $760,000 of revenue generated by an order from a non-law enforcement international customer for our FirstVU HD body worn cameras, storage systems and extended service agreement. Gross profit declined 37% to $5,301,233 in 2016, versus $8,349,355 in 2015. Our gross margin decline is commensurate with the 17% decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 68% from 58% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that gross margins will improve in 2017 because we have corrected the workmanship and other issues affecting our FirstVU HD product during recent quarters, including the PCB contamination issue addressed in the second and third quarters 2016. Our goal is to improve our margins to 60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products, in particular the DVM-800, DVM-800 HD and FirstVU HD, as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial market penetration in 2017. In addition, as revenues increase from these products, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.Read MoreSelling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased approximately 11% to $17,787,421 in 2016, versus $15,970,826 a year earlier. Research and development costs increased 7% to $3,186,137 in 2016 compared with $2,980,807 in 2015. We are increasing our engineering staff of web-based developers as we expand our offerings to include, among other items, cloud-based evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and our web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU Manager). We have several active new projects in development, along with multiple upgrades to our existing products. Selling, advertising and promotional expense rose 7% to $4,238,895, compared with $3,965,400 in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to our becoming the title sponsor in 2015 of the Web.com Tour golf tournament held annually in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Our net promotional expense related to the 2016 tournament was $499,313 compared with $172,623 for the 2015 tournament, an increase of $326,690. Professional fees and related expenses rose 41% to $1,930,625 last year, compared with $1,368,758 a year earlier. The increase in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to higher litigation expenses related to the Utility, Taser, and WatchGuard lawsuits. We expect litigation expense to trend higher during 2017 as we commence the jury trial in the Utility lawsuit and discovery activities in the Taser and WatchGuard lawsuits. We intend to pursue recovery from Utility, Taser, WatchGuard, their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate. Executive, support and administrative staff payroll expenses increased to $4,115,816 in the most recent year, compared with $2,941,151 a year earlier. This increase is attributable to hiring additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded. Further, we required additional technical and marketing support for our newer products, such as the DVM-800 HD, VuLink and FirstVU HD and, in particular, the new cloud-based VuVault.net and FleetVU Manager service-based products. Executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key employees and certain executives received raises or bonuses after several years of salaries being frozen.We reported an operating loss of ($12,486,188) for 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($7,621,471) in the previous year.Interest income increased to $26,195 in the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $21,156 a year earlier. Non-cash income totaled $33,977 in 2016 to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrant derivatives. Non-cash charges of $4,063,377 were incurred in 2015 to reflect changes in fair value of the note payable and derivatives associated with the conversion of the secured convertible note into common stock and the exercise of associated warrants, along with fair value of the note payable and derivatives.Because we elected to account for and record our secured convertible debentures on a fair value basis, we were required to expense certain related issuance costs to "other expense" during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Such costs totaled $281,570 and $93,845 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Other income was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2016 versus $1,878 in 2015.Interest expense totaled $3,102 in 2016, compared to $282,233 in the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our reduced indebtedness throughout 2016. We reported a 2016 net loss of ($12,710,688), or ($2.38) per share, compared with a prior-year net loss of ($12,037,892), or ($2.77) per share. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in either 2016 or 2015. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry forwards, until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize such assets. During 2016, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by approximately $4.4 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $40.1 million of net operating loss carryforwards and $2.0 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future net taxable income. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported an adjusted net loss (before depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, change in derivative liabilities, change in the fair value of secured convertible notes, secured convertible debentures issuance expense, and stock-based compensation), of ($10,273,557), or ($1.92) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of ($5,448,791), or ($1.26) per diluted share, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. (Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is described in greater detail in a table at the end of this press release).Fourth Quarter Operating ResultsFor the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, our total revenue decreased 32% to approximately $3.4 million, compared with revenue of approximately $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. We believe our revenues in the fourth quarter 2016 continued to be negatively impacted by Taser's misleading press release, the reexamination of our patent commenced by Taser with the USPTO and our product quality control issues.Gross profit was $148,807 (4% of revenue) in the fourth quarter 2016, versus $1,563,647 (31% of revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter 2016, we scrapped approximately $570,000 of inventory, most of which related to our FirstVU HD product and its product quality issues. We also increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $485,000 in fourth quarter 2016 due to the implementation of newer versions of PCB components, making previous versions excess or obsolete and higher levels of used or trade-in inventory and items requiring refurbishment.Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 2% to $4,162,802 in the final quarter of 2016, versus $4,264,176 a year earlier. Research and development costs increased 14% to $833,056 in the most recent quarter, compared with $732,944 in 2015. Selling, advertising and promotional expenses decreased 7% in the final quarter of 2016 to $943,152 versus $1,013,609 a year earlier. Stock-based compensation expense decreased 29% to $389,053, compared with $545,548 in the year-earlier period due primarily to the increased amortization of restricted stock granted in 2015 to our officers, directors and other employees due to their grant date fair value. General and administrative expense increased 1% to $1,997,541, compared with $1,972,075 in the corresponding period of the previous year.Our operating loss was ($4,013,995) for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($2,700,529) in the fourth quarter of 2015.Interest income decreased to $4,092 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, versus $8,583 in the year-earlier quarter. We reported non-cash income of $15,237 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with non-cash charges totaling ($422) in the year-earlier quarter. Such non-cash income (charges) reflects changes in fair value of the warrant derivatives associated with the senior convertible notes payable. Warrants to purchase 12,200 common shares remain unexercised at December 31, 2016 and 2015 which are treated as derivative liabilities.Interest expense totaled $664 and $1,261 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our reduced indebtedness throughout 2016.We elected to account for and record our $4.0 million secured convertible debentures issued in December 2016 on its fair value basis. Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs of $281,570 to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations in fourth quarter 2016. There were no similar debt issuance costs for fourth quarter 2015.We reported a net loss of ($4,276,900), or ($0.80) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of ($2,693,629), or ($0.53) per share, in the prior-year period. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of either 2016 or 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss (earnings/loss before, depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, changes in derivative liabilities, losses on the conversion of secured convertible notes payable, secured convertible note issuance expenses, and stock-based compensation), of ($3,481,399), or ($0.63) per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ($2,024,810), or ($0.40), in the three months ended December 31, 2015. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Digital Ally, Inc. has provided financial information in this release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Announces Second Quarter Operating ResultsMarketwiredAugust 5, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareLENEXA, KS--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2016) - Digital Ally, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  DGLY ), which develops, manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement, homeland security and commercial applications, today announced its operating results for the second quarter and first half of 2016. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Monday, August 8, 2016 (see details below) to discuss these operating results and other topics of interest.Highlights for Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 Gross profit margin approximated 28.9% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2016, compared with 54.9% in the prior-year quarter and 42.1% in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in gross profit margin relative to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to charges taken to correct our contract manufacturer's workmanship issues that resulted in contamination of the printed circuit boards (PCB) for our FirstVU HD product. We became aware of these issues during second quarter 2016.   Total revenue decreased by 22% to approximately $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared with approximately $5.6 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by a competitor's misleading press release regarding our patents combined with delayed FirstVU HD sales while we resolved the PCB board contamination issues.   The Company shipped four orders in excess of $100,000 each during the most recent quarter, for a total of $1.4 million, compared with seven individual orders exceeding $100,000 each in the year-earlier quarter, for a total of $1.3 million.  Our sales mix continues to migrate to our DVM-800 in-car video system and FirstVU HD body-worn camera, which contributed 62% of total sales for the three months ended June 30, 2015, versus 55% for the corresponding period of the previous year.   The Company reported an operating loss of ($2,892,657) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($816,962) in the three months ended June 30, 2015.  A net loss of ($2,865,084), or ($0.54) per share, was recorded in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of ($792,388), or ($0.20) per share, in the corresponding period of the previous year.   On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($2,393,626), or ($0.45) per share, in the most recent quarter, compared with a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ($318,207), or ($0.08) per share, in the three months ended June 30, 2015.  On May 27, 2016, Digital Ally filed suit against WatchGuard alleging patent infringement involving the Company's "auto-activation" technology utilized in its VuLink product.   Management Comments"Our second quarter revenues were down from prior-year levels," stated Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally, Inc. "We believe our second quarter 2016 revenues were negatively impacted by the ongoing confusion caused by a competitor's misleading press release regarding our patents. Additionally, our FirstVU HD sales were hindered by the PCB board contamination issues. We expect FirstVU HD sales to recover during the remainder of 2016 as we resolve the PCB board contamination matter and we prosecute the patent lawsuits against our competitors. The "auto-activation" technology embodied in our VuLink product is becoming a standard requirement for agencies utilizing body-worn cameras. We are encouraged by the progress of litigation instituted against our competitors to protect our patented technology.""Our body-worn camera has received much media attention in recent months. Consequently, many law enforcement agencies, both domestic and international, are actively testing and evaluating the FirstVU HD, and we expect demand to accelerate during the balance of 2016. We have dramatically increased our production and delivery capabilities relative to the FirstVU HD body-worn camera, and we continue to develop other new products. We believe a shift occurring in the buying pattern of our customers, as our patented VuLink ecosystem that provides officers with auto-activation of in-car and body camera systems has generated significant interest among law enforcement agencies. Agencies are recognizing the importance and value of collecting video evidence of interactions between law enforcement and civilians from multiple perspectives and automatically activating the recordings in high-stress situations. As policy and proper funding fall into place, we are optimistic these evaluation programs will continue to culminate in sales as the potential customers evaluate our body-worn and in-car video camera solutions.""The Company's gross margin decreased to 28.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2016, from 42.1% in the first quarter 2016. This gross margin decline was primarily attributable to workmanship issues we became aware of in the second quarter 2016 on the printed circuit boards used in our FirstVU HD product. The workmanship problems resulted in a higher than normal rate of contaminated PCB boards in our finished goods inventory, as well as deployed units in the field that had to be replaced. A contract manufacturer did not follow the Company's specifications regarding the flux used in the soldering process for certain of the components utilized in the PCB board assemblies and the vendor is correcting its quality control procedures to address this issue. We believe the FirstVU HD connector upgrade program that effected previous quarters' gross margins has been completed. We have accrued the estimated costs associated with the workmanship issues on PCB boards that resulted in higher failure rates in the second quarter 2016 and charged them to cost of sales as of June 30, 2016. Therefore, we believe that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters." "We entered 2016 with a stronger balance sheet and greater liquidity, which should support a significantly higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming," added Ross. "Unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled $4.1 million and we were debt-free at June 30, 2016. We had approximately $14.6 million in net working capital available at such date, including $2.8 million of accounts receivable and $9.7 million of inventory. We will work to continue reducing inventory levels during the balance of 2016 to provide additional funding for operations," concluded Ross.Read MoreSecond Quarter Operating ResultsFor the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's revenue decreased 22% to approximately $4.4 million, compared with revenue of approximately $5.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015. We attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by a competitor's misleading press release regarding our patents combined with delayed FirstVU HD sales while we resolve the PCB board contamination issues. We expect FirstVU HD sales to recover during the remainder of 2016 as we resolve the PCB board contamination matter and prosecute the patent lawsuits against our competitors. We believe the VuLink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented "auto-activation" technology. We believe our "auto-activation" technology is becoming a standard feature for agencies utilizing body-worn cameras.Digital Ally shipped four orders in excess of $100,000 each during the most recent quarter, which generated combined revenue of approximately $1.4 million. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company shipped seven orders valued individually at greater than $100,000, which generated combined revenue of approximately $1.3 million.Gross profit decreased 59% to $1,265,236 (28.9% of revenue) in the most recent quarter, versus $3,092,194 (54.9% of revenue) in the prior-year quarter and $1,853,619 (42.1% of revenue) in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in gross profit margin relative to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to workmanship issues on PCB boards for our FirstVU HD product that we became aware of during second quarter 2016. The workmanship issues resulted in a higher than normal rate of contaminated PCB boards in our finished goods inventory, as well as deployed units in the field. The Company incurred total charges to cost of sales approximating $650,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 related to this issue. These charges result from the disassembly of the FirstVU HD, inspection of all PCB boards and replacement of PCB boards exhibiting contamination issues. We are requesting and receiving deployed units for disassembly and inspection in order to identify contaminated PCB boards for replacement purposes. This process was not complete as of June 30, 2016; therefore, we have increased our warranty reserves to accommodate such future costs, although there is no assurance that we have identified the complete population of potentially contaminated PCB boards and estimated cost to complete the process. We will negotiate with the contract manufacturer responsible for the workmanship issues for reimbursement of some portion of the costs; however, it is too early to estimate the potential recovery, if any, from the ultimate resolution of this matter. Additionally, we scrapped approximately $350,000 of cable assemblies and older versions of our products in the second quarter 2016, which also increased our cost of revenues. The Company's goal is to improve gross margins to 60% of revenue over the longer term based on the expected margins of its newer products, in particular the DVM-800 and FirstVU HD, if they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and production of commercial products increases. In addition, as revenue from these products increases, the Company will seek to further improve gross margins through economies of scale and more efficient utilization of fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 6% to $4,157,893 in the second quarter of 2016, compared with $3,909,156 in the second quarter of 2015. Research and Development costs rose 4% to $813,150 (vs. $783,880 in 2015). The Company increased the size of its engineering staff of web-based developers in order to expand its offerings to include, among other items, cloud-based evidence storage and management of its law enforcement customers (VuVault.net) and its web-based commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool (FleetVU). Selling, advertising and promotional expense rose 8% to $1,003,507 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $932,407 a year earlier. The Company hired additional territory salesmen during the last half of 2015 to provide better coverage of the domestic market, which additions have not yet resulted in increased revenues as they become familiar with our products and customers. Stock-based compensation expense, a non-cash expense, totaled $355,236 and $329,201 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of 8%. The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the restricted stock granted during 2015 and 2016 to our officers and other employees. Professional fees and related expenses totaled $484,254 and $430,809 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of 12%. The increase is due to higher litigation expenses related to the Utility, Taser and WatchGuard lawsuits. We expect litigation expense to trend higher during the remainder of 2016 as we pursue recovery, injunctions, awards and judgements from Utility, Taser and WatchGuard. Executive, support and administrative staff payroll expenses increased 33% to $843,598, compared with $634,128 a year earlier, due primarily to the hiring of additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters. Additionally, executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key executives received raises and bonuses after several years of salaries being frozen. Other SG&A expenses totaled $658,148 and $798,731 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of 18%. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased consulting and contract labor expenses. We utilized consultants to help design, develop and launch a new corporate website in 2015. For the reasons previously stated, the Company reported an operating loss of ($2,892,657) for the second quarter of 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($816,962) in the year-earlier quarter.Interest income increased to $7,198 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, versus $2,828 a year earlier.Interest expense totaled $907 and $79,841 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our reduced indebtedness in 2016. All interest bearing debt other than capital leases was retired in 2015 from the proceeds of our registered direct offering of common stock in July 2015.Non-operating income of $21,282 was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of changes in warrant derivative values compared with non-operating income of $116,061 for second quarter 2015. Because the Company elected to account for and record its Senior Secured Convertible Note payable on a fair value basis, it was required to expense certain related issuance costs to "other expense" during the second quarter of 2015. Such costs totaled $0 for second quarter 2016 and $14,474 in the year-earlier quarter. The Company reported a 2016 second quarter net loss of ($2,865,084), or ($0.54) per share, compared with a prior-year net loss of ($792,388), or ($0.20) per share. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the second quarters of either 2016 or 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding totaled 5,319,259 in the most recent quarter, versus 4,044,112 in the year-earlier quarter. The Company expects to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, including approximately $34.8 million of net operating loss carry forwards, until it determines that it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize such assets. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss (before, depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, changes in derivative liabilities, losses on the conversion of secured convertible notes payable, secured convertible note issuance expenses, and stock-based compensation), of ($2,393,626), or ($0.45) per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, versus a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ($318,207), or ($0.08) per share, in the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss is described in greater detail in a table at the end of this press release.Six-Month Operating ResultsFor the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's revenue decreased 11% to approximately $8.8 million, compared with revenue of approximately $9.9 million in the first half of 2015. The Company experienced delays in FirstVU orders during the first half of 2016 as it dealt with the PCB board contamination and connector upgrade issues. Marketplace confusion from a competitor's misleading press release regarding our patented "auto-activation" technology also occurred during the period. Digital Ally shipped five orders in excess of $100,000 each during the first half of 2016, which generated combined revenue of approximately $1.5 million. During the prior-year period, the Company shipped 11 orders valued individually at greater than $100,000, for a total of $1.8 million in revenue.International revenue totaled $326,960 during the first half of 2016, versus $106,486 in the corresponding period of the previous year, an increase of 207%. Gross profit decreased 34% to $3,118,855 (35.5% of revenue) in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $4,745,934 (48.0% of revenue) in the prior-year period. The decline is the result of rework issues involving our FirstVU product.Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 11% to $8,349,407 in the first half of 2016, compared with $7,526,091 in the first half of 2015. Increases were primarily attributable to increased professional fees, in particular legal fees, and increases in SG&A payroll.The Company reported an operating loss of ($5,230,552) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared with an operating loss of ($2,780,157) in the year-earlier period.Interest income increased to $16,190 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, versus $8,143 a year earlier.Interest expense totaled $1,662 and $206,014 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our reduced indebtedness in 2016. All interest bearing debt other than capital leases was retired in 2015 from the proceeds of our registered direct offering of common stock in July 2015.Non-operating income of $37,815 was recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2016 as a result of changes in warrant derivative values compared with non-operating income of $116,061 in the year-earlier period.The holder of the $4.0 million Senior Secured Convertible Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of such Note into common stock during the first quarter of 2015. Because the Company elected to account for and record the Note on a fair value basis, when the holder of the Note exercised its right to convert the remaining principal balance of the Note and accrued interest into 661,213 shares of common stock, a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $4,434,383 was incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2015. This reflected the increase in the Company's stock price over the conversion rate as of the conversion dates. There was no corresponding income or expense relative to changes in fair value of secured convertible notes payable in 2016 since the Note was fully converted in 2015.Because the Company elected to account for and record such Note on a fair value basis, it was required to expense certain related issuance costs to "other expense" during the six months ended June 2015. Such costs totaled $0 at June 30, 2016 and $74,350 at June 30, 2015. Other income was $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $1,878 in the first half of 2015.The Company reported a net loss of ($5,178,209), or ($0.98) per share, in the first half of 2016, compared with a prior-year net loss of ($7,203,100), or ($1.94) per share. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the first six months of either 2016 or 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding totaled 5,282,514 in the six months ended June 30, 2016, versus 3,710,960 in the year-earlier period. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss (earnings/loss before, depreciation, amortization, net interest expense, changes in derivative liabilities, losses on the conversion of secured convertible notes payable, secured convertible note issuance expenses, and stock-based compensation), of ($4,153,673), or ($0.79) per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, versus a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of ($1,843,032), or ($0.50) per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss is described in greater detail in a table at the end of this press release.Non-GAAP Financial Measures Digital Ally, Inc. has provided financial information in this release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information includes non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss. Digital Ally uses such non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Digital Ally's ongoing operational performance. Digital Ally believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in Digital Ally's industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. As noted, the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude certain non-cash and/or non-recurring expenses/income including: (1) depreciation and amortization expense, (2) net interest expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) changes in fair value of secured convertible notes payable, (5) secured convertible notes payable issuance expenses, (6) and changes in warrant derivative valuations.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables included as part of this press release.Investor Conference Call The Company will host an investor conference call at 11:15 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Monday, August 8, 2016, to discuss its operating results for the second quarter and first half of 2016, along with other topics of interest.
