Products[edit]
Samsung Electro-Mechanics manufactures products in a number of categories:

Mobile component, display component, component for semiconductor, computer component

Printed circuit boards (PCBs)[edit]
The purpose of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is to transmit electrical signals among various electronic parts and components. Microcircuits and build-up technologies are applied to produce the class of PCB known as the high-density interconnection (HDI) board. These value-added parts enable engineers to make their finished products lighter, thinner and smaller. HDI boards are mainly found in top-end handheld devices, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics enjoys a major share of the world market for HDI boards used in mobile phones.
Package substrates The package substrate is responsible for conveying electrical signals between semiconductors and the motherboard on which they are attached. This substrate consists of much smaller circuitry than that found on conventional types. Ball grid array (BGA) is a technology that eliminates the need for wire bonding on chip packages. The flip-chip chip scale package (FC CSP) is a substrate that uses bumps to electrically connect the chip with the motherboard. The flip-chip ball grid array is a substrate for high-end semiconductor packages. The semiconductor chip and substrate are connected by flip-chip bumps, improving the electrical and thermal properties.
MLCC (multilayer ceramic capacitor)[edit]
The multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) is a commonly used part in electronic products. For example, a smart phone has more than 400 MLCCs, while a tablet PC contains about 500, a laptop computer contains least 800 and an LCD TV uses over 1,300. These devices serve as a kind of dam to adjust electric current to the specification of the product in question.
The global trend toward smaller and lighter electronics products is driving demand for MLCCs of smaller sizes with higher capacities.
Camera modules[edit]
The camera module has an image sensor that converts the light that enters through the lens into digital signals, which are then used to produce still pictures or video.
Samsung Electro-Mechanics is developing exceptional mobile phone camera modules with high pixel resolution, ultra-slim profile, automatic focus, zoom lens and other attractive features.
The company is also expanding its camera module business into new applications such as automobiles and home networks.
Network modules[edit]
Wi-Fi Modules The Wi-Fi (a trademark) module enables personal computers, video game consoles, smartphones, tablets and other products to access the internet in real time.
Cellular modules The cellular module uses broadband frequencies to provide tablets, personal computers and M2M devices with internet connectivity.
Global worksite[edit]
Samsung Electro-Mechanics, which directly sells over 80 percent of its own products overseas Samsung operates production subsidiaries, R&D centers, sales subsidiaries, and offices suitable for the characteristics of the five regions of the U.S., Europe, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia.
