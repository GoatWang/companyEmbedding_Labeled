Business Description


Energous Corporation has developed WattUp®, a groundbreaking RF-based charging technology that will fundamentally change the way you think about charging your portable electronic devices. The WattUp wire-free charging system delivers energy over the air in your home, office, car or practically any other space you can imagine via a contained energy pocket. Mobile, wire-free power management means freedom from cords or stationary charging pads, and the potential freedom from worrying about running out of battery life altogether.

Company Overview


Energous Corporation is the developer of WattUp® - an award-winning, wire-free charging technology that will transform the way consumers and industries charge and power electronic devices at home, in the office, in the car and beyond. WattUp is a revolutionary radio frequency (RF) based charging solution that delivers intelligent, scalable power via radio bands, similar to a Wi-Fi router. WattUp differs from current wireless charging systems in that it delivers contained power, at a distance, to multiple devices - thus resulting in a wire-free experience that saves users from having to plug in their devices.

					Full Description



Energous Corporation, incorporated on October 30, 2012, is engaged in developing a technology called WattUp that consists of semiconductor chipsets, software, hardware designs and antennas that can enable radio frequency (RF)-based wire-free charging for electronic devices, providing power at a distance and enabling charging with mobility under software control. Its technology can be utilized in a range of devices, including wearables, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smartphones, tablets, e-book readers, keyboards, mice, remote controls, rechargeable lights, cylindrical batteries and any other device with similar charging requirements that would otherwise need a battery or a connection to a power outlet.The Company is engaged in developing a solution that charges electronic devices by surrounding them with a contained three-dimensional (3D) RF energy pocket (RF energy pocket). The Company is also engaged in developing its transmitter technology to mesh, to form a wire-free charging network that will allow users to charge their devices as they walk from room-to-room or throughout a large space. The Company has developed multiple transmitter prototypes in various form factors and power capabilities. The Company has also developed multiple receiver prototypes, including smartphone battery cases, toys, fitness trackers, Bluetooth headsets, as well as stand-alone receivers.The Company's technology solution consists principally of transmitter and receiver application specific standard products (ASSPs) and antenna designs driven through algorithms and software applications. The Company has developed a building block approach, which allows the Company to scale its product implementations by combining multiple transmitter building blocks and/or multiple receiver building blocks. Its power router, or transmitter, locates the receiver(s) in 3D space through technology it has developed using Bluetooth communications. The transmitter, through software control, generates a controlled and contained RF-waveform to create an RF energy pocket around the receiver(s). Its transmitter uses software algorithms to direct, focus and control its RF waveform in approximately three dimensions as it transmits energy to a moving object (such as a user holding their mobile device as they walk around a room).

"Seriously, of all the tech we saw amongst the hundreds of companies we came into contact with at CES, this has the biggest potential to completely changes our lives."

Scott Tharler															 / Maxim Magazine










"I don't say this often, but I think we are looking at the future of technology."

David Pogue															 / Yahoo! Tech










"Wireless charging has been a CES tech demo for years. But Energous may be the first company to  make the idea practical...the technology is small enough, smart enough, and powerful enough to make a big impact in the near future."

Mark Wilson															 / Fast Company










"Energous has a solution for wirelessly charging wearables. Its chip will fit where an inductive coil will not."

Put the price the same as regular phone c⋯⋯hargers and people would definitely buy this instead of wired charging cables. However I think one thing you might have overlooked is the video gaming market! You can team up with Sony and Microsoft to put these chargers in their controllers so that we never have to plug our wireless controllers in ever again. If that becomes a thing, and no one has ever said that before, then please give me some credit lol. 更多Matthew Scot · 2017年3月22日I'm an investor in your company and very excited for the future!Jeremy White · 2017年2月13日Congrats on the Edison award!
