Detailed Description


Not sure if this is the right driver or software for your component? Run Intel® Driver Update Utility to automatically detect driver or software updates.Running this easy-to-use Intel® Driver Update Utility tells you if you need to update your chipset INF file and will prompt you to install. This will save you a lot of time on your chipset download and common file downloads needed for your system.Download Server Chipset DriverName changesIntel® Chipset Device Software is the new name for the Intel® Chipset Software Installation Utility; this name will be seen when running the installation package.About this file/downloadThe Intel Chipset Device Software installs the Windows* INF files. An INF is a text file that provides the operating system with information about a piece of hardware on the system. In the case of the current Intel Chipset Device Software, that information is primarily the product name for the piece of hardware. This allows the operating system to show the correct name for that piece of hardware in Device Manager.Note: The Intel Chipset Device Software does not install drivers for AGP or USB. Do not download this utility if your device manufacturer is recommending it to correct an "AGP driver," "AGP GART," or "USB driver" issue; it will not correct your issue.Read attached readme and release notes files before installing.Keywords: 82801, ICH, MCH About Intel® DriversThe driver or software for your Intel® component might have been changed or replaced by the computer manufacturer. We recommend you work with your computer manufacturer before installing our driver so you don’t lose features or customizations.   See list of manufacturers’ Support websites.

3 Intel Corporation Product Launches to Look Forward To in 2017
This Fool goes over three Intel product launches that he thinks investors should pay attention to.

            Jun 26, 2017 at 8:15AM
            
            





In the first half of 2017, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has released many products, including its seventh-generation Core processors for notebook and desktop computers, as well as its first Core X-series processors for the high-end desktop personal computer market.
However, compared with what the company has in store for the remainder of the year, what we've seen so far looks rather tame.

Image source: Intel.

Let's consider three Intel product launches that I'm looking forward to and why investors should care about them.
The big Purley launch 
Intel's most important growth business is its data-center group, commonly abbreviated DCG. While this business has been a nice source of growth for the company for many years, it hasn't grown as quickly as the company had hoped over the last several years.
This year, Intel expects DCG revenue to grow at a "high-single-digit" rate, though the company's long-term revenue growth here is a "low-double-digit" rate.
One way Intel can try to juice growth is to bring out new and compelling products. New products not only give potential customers reasons to upgrade their current hardware infrastructure, but with sufficient feature and performance additions, as well as sensible product segmentation efforts, the company can also try to boost its processor average selling prices.
Sometime this summer, Intel is expected to launch its next-generation server processor platform, known as Purley. With Purley, Intel not only promises to bring faster processors to the table, but it's also promising a whole slew of new feature additions to the platform.
Intel's first revision of the Purley platform should be the main driver of the company's DCG revenue over the next year, though the company has indicated there are several such revisions in the pipeline. It'll be interesting to see how this one affects DCG's business performance.
Eighth-generation Core 
In the second half of this year -- probably in the fall -- Intel is expected to launch its eighth-generation Core processor family for some types of notebook and desktop personal computers.
Intel is expected to launch a product known as Kaby Lake-Refresh for notebook personal computers. These chips will include four processor cores and be manufactured in a new 14-nanometer++ technology, potentially providing a significant performance upgrade over the current Kaby Lake U-series notebook chips that have just two processor cores and are manufactured in the company's less powerful 14-nanometer+ technology.
Intel is also expected to launch its first Coffee Lake processors for the enthusiast portion of the desktop personal computer market. These chips are also expected to be manufactured in the company's 14-nanometer++ technology and include up to six processor cores, up from the four processor cores currently available in the enthusiast-oriented Kaby Lake processors.
Intel has indicated that to keep its personal computer processor average selling prices robust, it aims to release new products at an annual clip that offer improved performance, features, and integration.





Those high-core count Core X chips 
Although Intel has formally announced its entire Core X processor lineup for high-end desktop personal computers, only the chips with between four and 10 cores are currently available for pre-order.
Intel says a Core X processor with 12 cores will arrive in August, while variants with 14, 16, and 18 cores will launch in October.
While the 12- to 18-core parts are certainly niche products that are likely to sell in rather small quantities, they should be rather lucrative for the company. Furthermore, since the products are being released in multiple phases, Intel gets multiple opportunities to launch products, build buzz for the new chips (as well as the rest of the chips in the product line), and so on.

It's all about margins.

On May 30, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its Core X series of processors and the accompanying X299 platform for high-end desktop personal computers.
The lineup consists of two distinct families of processors. The first is Skylake-X, which comes in configurations with as few as six processor cores and as many as 18 processor cores (though the 18-core models are slated to become available later).

The second is Kaby Lake-X, which includes a four-core/four-thread chip in the form of the Core i5-7640X and a four-core/eight-thread chip in the form of the Core i7-7740X.
The Kaby Lake-X chips are quite controversial among many in the technology community because they are merely the same Core i5-7600 and Core i7-7700K chips the launched back in January, respectively, but repackaged to work in the more expensive X299 motherboards, rather than the lower-cost Z270 motherboards.
Here's why I think Intel chose to release these chips.
The entry-level X299 parts
Intel clearly wanted to have "entry level" parts for its high-end desktop platform, and there are certainly good reasons to want them.
For example, an individual building a computer around the X299 platform might want a computer now, but may not have enough money for the higher core count part that they may eventually want. So, a reasonable option for that customer would be to build the system with a relatively low-cost "stop gap" part and then, at some point down the line, upgrade to something better.

Image source: Intel.

Alternatively, customers might simply want the features/capabilities that the Core i5-7600K/Core i7-7700K offer, but would like to pair them with more feature-packed motherboards. Buying a 7640X or a 7740X and pairing it with an X299 motherboard (high-end desktop motherboards tend to be more feature-rich on average than mainstream desktop motherboards) would be a good solution for such a potential buyer.
Now, you might be thinking that it might make more sense for Intel to simply offer quad-core versions of the Skylake-X chips than to do the work to bring the mainstream Kaby Lake-S chips over to the X299 platform. But it doesn't.
Two big reasons
The first reason that Intel likely didn't simply offer a quad-core Skylake-X part as the entry-level chip for X299 is economics.
The Skylake-X parts are based on two silicon die: the first is Intel's LCC chip, which has 10 cores, and the second is the company's HCC chip, which has 18 cores on the die. Per InstLatX64 on social media, the chip size of the LCC Skylake-X is north of 300 square millimeters.
Intel would have to disable a substantial portion of this large, expensive-to-manufacture chip if it wanted to use it to offer quad-core parts on the X299 platform.
That's not good for Intel's product margins, particularly as it's unlikely that its manufacturing yields on its 14-nanometer+ technology are bad enough that it produces many parts with six defective cores. 
By contrast, Intel's quad-core Kaby Lake die measures in at around 126 square millimeters in the same 14-nanometer+ technology that the Skylake-X parts are manufactured in. Now, much of that die area is taken up by a graphics processor that's disabled, but even with that part of the chip turned off, the chip is still small enough to begin with, and sells for a hefty enough sum, that Kaby Lake-X represents a financial "win" for Intel.





And one more thing
A final reason that the Kaby Lake-X processors make more sense than a heavily disabled Skylake-X part is Intel's segmentation strategy. The Kaby Lake-X chips only have 16 PCI Express lanes on the silicon die, while the lowest-end six-core Skylake-X has 28 of its 44 (usable) lanes enabled.
So, Intel's sales pitch to customers, then, is that they can have 50% more cores and 12 more PCI Express lanes for about $40-$50 more than the top Kaby Lake-X part. This, Intel probably hopes, will encourage upsell to the six-core part, ultimately enriching its product mix.
