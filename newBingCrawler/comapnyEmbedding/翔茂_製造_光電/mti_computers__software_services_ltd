不用寫程式就能在ERP製作任何APP的雲端開發平台 
寶盛最近研發的「任你開發平台」(Zen Neo PaaS)可供開發者在雲端開發APP，而且完全不用寫程式。開發者可於數分鐘內完成APP的開發，滿足主管臨時想要的行動應用。這些APP可以查詢或維護NEO ERP的任何資料、發出或簽核任何NEO ERP的單據，所有NEO ERP的功能都能快速做成行動應用，而且不用寫程式。NEO ERP的Zen Neo PaaS已實現Gartner宣告的最新ERP技術：PaaS-Based ERP。
 
不寫程式也能客製ERP系統，歡迎加入NEO經銷商行列 
NEO ERP是積木式架構，只要會組裝積木就能客製ERP系統，不必寫程式。經銷商不但有產品收入，也有幫用戶客製系統的服務收入。歡迎加入寶盛經銷商行列。
 
Gartner宣告SOA-ERP將取代主從式架構ERP 
全球最權威的ERP研究機構Gartner Group於2012年宣佈5到10年內SOA-ERP將取代主從式架構ERP，成為市場主流。
寶盛從2003年開始研發積木式的服務導向架構SOA-ERP，2011年推出產品NEO SOA-ERP後已獲數十家大小企業採用，Gartner的宣告證明寶盛在10年前的決策是正確的。
現今大多數ERP系統都還停留在僵化無彈性的主從式架構ERP，國內只有寶盛有能力開發SOA-ERP系統。從Gartner的市場預測可知，當大部分ERP已夕陽西下時，寶盛的NEO SOA-ERP正在旭日東昇。
由於SOA-ERP具備如同組合積木般的極大彈性，故能滿足各行各業、各種規模企業的需求。NEO的彈性讓商務流程管理(BPM)有極大的揮灑空間，企業可以持續的改善其商務流程。
寶盛的使命是『以彈性化的SOA-ERP工具，協助企業改善商務流程，讓企業能更敏捷、更快速的滿足其客戶的需求。』對寶盛而言，SOA-ERP只是工具，為企業打造最適商務流程才是目標之所在，所以寶盛希望以最好的工具提供最好的BPM改善服務給有改善決心、老闆願意親自投入參與改善專案的企業。
而雲端正是SOA的延伸，使用從雲端提供的SOA-ERP服務可讓企業不再花費資源於非其本業的資訊科技上面。利用雲端SOA-ERP，企業可專注於核心能力的開發，成為其專業領域的領導者。

Manufacturers Are Confronted With Many Estimating Challenges 


             A recent survey found that over 92% of all manufacturers develop cost estimates and quotes based primarily on experience alone. 
The biggest challenges reported in the survey:
			   - Lack of consistency between estimators- 73%
               - Poor quoting throughput- 67%
               - Inaccurate cost estimates- 56%
