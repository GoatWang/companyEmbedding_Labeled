Company Overview

Considering peers, relative underperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a lagging position.


Wutong Holding Group Co., Ltd. Class A’s current Price/Book of 5.25 is about median in its peer group.


The market expects 300292-CN to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.


300292-CN has relatively high profit margins while operating with median asset turns.


The company’s year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group.


300292-CN‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years suggest that its relatively high operating returns are sustainable.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While 300292-CN‘s revenues in recent years have grown faster than the peer median, the market gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median suggesting that the market has some questions about the company’s long-term strategy.


The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.


300292-CN has the financial and operating capacity to borrow quickly.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
