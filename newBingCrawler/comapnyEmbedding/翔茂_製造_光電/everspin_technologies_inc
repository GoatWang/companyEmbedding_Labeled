Happy Thanksgiving and hope you enjoy. Please lik...youtube.comEverspin Technologies, Inc. · 2015年10月28日 · I've received a few emails asking, "What's an MRAM"? So, here's the answer: An MRAM is a white long-haired goat like animal with curled horns that lives in the mountains, thus the name MRAM! Did you buy that? Of course not! OK, so here's what an MRAM really is; An MRAM is a Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory which is a method of storing data bits using magnetic charges instead of the electrical charges used by DRAM (dynamic random access memory). Scientists define a metal ⋯⋯as magnetoresistive if it shows a slight change in electrical resistance when placed in a magnetic field. By combining the high speed of static RAM and the high density of DRAM, MRAM could be used to significantly improve electronic products by storing greater amounts of data, enabling it to be accessed faster while consuming less battery power than existing electronic memory. Our next generation products are called ST-MRAM's, or STT-MRAM's. The ST stands for Spin Torque, or Spin Transfer Torque This stuff is very a complicated and complex technology that would take me a week of writing to explain. Really? You really want me to explain?...OK, well you asked for it! Spin Transfer Torque is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve can be modified using a spin-polarized current. Now, that was easy wasn't it? 更多Everspin Technologies, Inc. · 2015年10月12日 · I am looking for 2 Contract Layout Designers for our Austin, TX design center.

The MR25H128A is a 128Kbit magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device organized as 16,384 words of 8 bits. The MR25H128A offers serial EEPROM and serial Flash compatible read/write timing with no write delays and unlimited read/write endurance.

Unlike other serial memories, both reads and writes can occur randomly in memory with no delay between writes. The MR25H128A is the ideal memory solution for applications that must store and retrieve data and programs quickly using a small number of I/O pins.

The MR25H128A is available in a 5 mm x 6 mm 8-pin DFN Small Flag package compatible with serial EEPROM, Flash, and FeRAM products.

The MR25H128A provides highly reliable data storage over a wide range of temperatures. The product is offered with industrial (-40° to +85 °C) and AEC-Q100 Grade 1 (-40°C to +125 °C) and AEC-Q100 Grade 3 (-40° to +85 °C) operating temperature range options.

INTRODUCTION
The MR4A08BUYS45 [x8] is a 16,777,216-bit magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device organized as 2,097,152 words of 8 bits. It is available in a 44-pin thin small outline package (TSOP Type 2), compatible with similar low-power SRAM products and other nonvolatile RAM products.

The MR4A16BUYS45 [x16] is a 16,777,216-bit magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device organized as 1,048,576 words of 16 bits. It is available in a 54-pin thin small outline package (TSOP Type 2), compatible with similar low-power SRAM products and other nonvolatile RAM products.
Both products have a -40/+125°C operating temperature range and offer SRAM-compatible 45ns read/write timing with unlimited endurance. Data is always non-volatile for greater than 20 years and automatically protected on power loss by low-voltage inhibit circuitry to prevent writes with voltage out of specification. Data retention is duty cycle limited at the temperature extremes.

These products are the ideal memory solution for applications that must permanently store and retrieve critical data and programs quickly, providing high reliability storage over the automotive temperature range of -40/+125°C. These products are not AEC Q-100 qualified.

1Mb Quad SPI Serial MRAM MR10Q010




High bandwidth – Read and Write at 52MB/sec
Quad I/O with the use of dual purpose pins to maintain a low pin count
Operates in both standard, single SPI mode and high speed quad SPI mode Fast quad Read and Write with quad address input and quad I/O
Intended for next generation RAID controllers, server system logs, storage device buffers, and embedded system data and program memory
Data is non-volatile with retention greater than 20 years
Automatic data protection on power loss
Unlimited write endurance
Low-current sleep mode
Dual 3.3v VDD / 1.8v VDDQ power supply
Tamper Detect function will detect possible data modification from outside magnetic fields.
Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) mode is supported to enhance system performance for Execute in Place (XIP) operation.
MSL Level 3.


The MR10Q010 is the ideal memory solution for applications that must store and retrieve data and programs quickly using a small number of pins, low power, and the space saving 16-pin SOIC package. The four I/O’s in Quad SPI mode allow very fast reads and writes, making it an attractive alternative to conventional parallel data bus interfaces in next generation RAID controllers, server system logs, storage device buffers, and embedded system data and program memory.
Using Everspin’s patented MRAM technology, both reads and writes can occur randomly in memory with no delay between writes.
Standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Quad SPI and Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) modes are supported at a clock rate up to 104MHz. XIP operation is supported for Read commands in all three modes.
The MR10Q010 Quad SPI MRAM is organized as 131,072 words of 8 bits.
