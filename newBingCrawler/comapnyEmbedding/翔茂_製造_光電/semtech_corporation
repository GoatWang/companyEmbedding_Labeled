 ESD Protection Semtech provides reliable system-level Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) circuit protection technologies that meet the industry's toughest requirements. Many low-voltage core chips only offer human body model (HBM) or device level (on-chip) ESD protection, which is not enough to address system-level risks -- especially as next generation ICs scale to smaller geometries. Semtech ESD protection diodes feature low clamping voltage, low capacitance, and low leakage current to protect your system interconnects from external ESD threats.   								In addition, our integrated circuit ESD protection devices provide transient protection to IEC 61000-4-2 (ESD) +/-15kV (air) +/-8kV (contact) standards, and protect sensitive semiconductor components from damage due to Cable Discharge Events (CDE). And our ESD protection circuits provide single line and multi-line TVS protection for a range of voltage levels: 2.8V to 70V.
