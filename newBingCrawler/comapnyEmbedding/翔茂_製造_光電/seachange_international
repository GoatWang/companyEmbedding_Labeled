History[edit]
SeaChange was founded in January 1993 by Bill Styslinger. At a time when U.S. cable operators needed rooms full of VCRs, each loaded with a tape with a single ad in order to carry out live linear ad replacement, SeaChange brought about a sea change (hence the company name) by introducing digital video servers that could contain and stream thousands of ads and were far more compact.
In 1996, the company became listed at NASDAQ. In April 2005, SeaChange bought the international assets of Liberate Technologies.[3] In September 2005, SeaChange acquired UK-based On-Demand Group (ODG).[4][5] In November 2008, SeaChange acquired Mobix Interactive, also from the UK.[6] In September 2009, SeaChange bought eventIS, based in the Netherlands.[7] In January 2010, SeaChange acquired Silicon Valley start-up VividLogic.[8][9] In June 2012, SeaChange obtained the assets of Flashlight Engineering and Consulting.[10] As part of a strategy to become a "pure-play software provider”[11] SeaChange did two divestitures: In May 2012, it sold ODG to Avail-TVN[12] and its server hardware business spun out to XOR Media that same month.[13] In a move that bears the hallmark of the recently appointed CEO Jay Samit, SeaChange announced in December 2014 it will acquire Timeline Labs, a start-up that makes tools for broadcasters and video service providers for audience measurement via social media.[14]
Products[edit]
SeaChange offers multi-screen television products, including Rave, an OTT platform that will be deliverable in a cloud-based SaaS model;[15] Adrenalin, a multi-screen television platform that enables service providers to manage, monetize, and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across televisions, personal computers (PCs), tablets, smartphones, and other IP-enabled devices; Nitro, subscriber experience software that gives service providers an interface that personalizes the multi-platform subscriber experience; and AssetFlow that is used to receive, manage, and publish content for on-demand viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs, and other consumer devices. The company also provides television advertising products, such as Infusion Advanced Advertising Platform that enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multi-screen, linear, on-demand, and over-the-top viewing; AdPulse, on-demand advertising software enabling service providers to capitalize on video-on-demand television services with ad placements; and AdFlow that enables advertisements to be ready for insertion and handles advertisement file processing, verification, transcoding operations, and confirms play-out for revenue booking. In addition, it provides Nucleus, video gateway software, as well as professional services, installation, training, project management, product maintenance, technical support, and software development related services. The company sells and markets its products and services through a direct sales organization, independent agents, and distributors.[2]
Awards[edit]
SeaChange has won a number of awards, including three Emmy Awards in the category Technology & Engineering:

2001: Emmy Awards for "Pioneering developments in shared video-data-storage systems technology" with the MediaCluster video server[16]
2003: Emmy Award for "Time-Shifted Television" software suite.[17]
2013: Emmy Award for the "Development and Commercialisation for Digital Infrastructure for Local Cable Ad Insertion"[18]

        SeaChange International, Inc.ge Broadcast MediaCluster 800 Series was developed as a low-price, high-performance video server system for small to medium sized broadcast operations, especially those running multichannel operations. The system can be scaled to grow with an organization.  The family of broadcast MediaCluster systems is designed for fault-resilient delivery of audio and video streams.  A system can scale from a cluster of three computers, or nodes, for television operators with modest I/O and storage requirements, up to a large multi-node cluster with dozens of inputs and outputs and terabytes of storage. Regardless of the number of nodes, it performs as a single server.

The system runs on the company's third-generation, Windows NT-based, MPEG-2 video server platform. It integrates standard computer technologies, specialized video subsystems, and software. The resulting video server platform creates a system for play-to-air applications like commercial insertion, time shift/delay, and program origination.
