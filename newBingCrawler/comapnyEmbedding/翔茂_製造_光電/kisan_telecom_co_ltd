Fixed Operation: For outdoor antenna the antenna(s) used for this transmitter must be fixed-mounted on outdoor permanent structures. RF exposure compliance may be addressed at the time of licensing, as required by the responsible FCC Bureau(s), including antenna co-location requirements of 1.1307(b)(3). The peak radiated output power must not exceed 7W ERP. For indoor antenna, the antenna(s) used for this transmitter are to be fixed-mounted on indoor permanent structures providing a separation distance of at least 20 cm from all persons during normal operation. Users and installers must be provided with appropriate antenna installation instructions and transmitter operating conditions, including antenna co-location requirements of 1.1307(b)(3), for satisfying RF exposure compliance. RF exposure compliance may need to be addressed at the time of licensing, as required by the responsible FCC Bureau(s), including antenna co-location requirements of 1.1307(b)(3).


Mobile operation: The antenna installation and operating configurations of this device, including any applicable source-based time-averaging duty factor, antenna gain and cable loss must satisfy MPE categorical Exclusion Requirements of 2.1091. The antenna(s) used for this device must be installed to provide a separation distance of at least 20 cm from all persons and must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter. Users and installers must be provided with antenna installation instructions and transmitter operating conditions for satisfying RF exposure compliance.
