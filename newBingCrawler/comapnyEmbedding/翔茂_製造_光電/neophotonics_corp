					Full Description



NeoPhotonics Corporation, incorporated on October 31, 1996, develops, manufactures and markets optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch digital optical signals for communications networks. The Company develops and manufactures Transmitter Products, Receiver Products and Switch Products that are used in ultra-high speed digital optical communications, high speed switching and provisioning, and access connections for wireless and fiber-to-the-home communications networks. The Company's products are categorized into groups, including High Speed Products and Network Products and Solutions. The High Speed Products includes products designed for 100G and beyond for telecommunication and datacenter or content provider networks and applications. Its Network Products and Solutions consist of various products designed for applications below 100G, and include 40G products. The Company combines its transmitter and receiver products into Transceiver modules. Its Switching Products, such as Multi-Cast Switches, are used primarily in Reconfigurable Optical Add Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) nodes that allocate bandwidth to adjust for fast changing traffic patterns and for provisioning software defined networks.High Speed ProductsThe Company produces transmitter and receiver products, as well as switching products for 100G and beyond optical transmission applications over distances of 2 to 2,000 kilometers. In addition, it combines 100G and beyond transmitter and receiver products into pluggable modules for both line side coherent and client side datacenter applications. Its high speed 100G and beyond products are based on its Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology. The technology supports encoding over 100 gigabits or more per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver. For Long Haul and Metro transport, the Company designs and manufactures optical components for coherent systems, which manipulate light to encode 10 times or more the amount of information in the same wavelength channel than is possible with traditional methods. Its Coherent Products include Narrow Linewidth Tunable transmit and local oscillator lasers (NLW-ITLA), which generate the ultra-pure wavelength, or color, necessary for coherent transmission, and Integrated Coherent Receivers (ICRs), which decode the phase and polarization encoded coherent signal. The Company also sells 100G products for the client side and datacenter applications, including 25GBaud electro-absorbtively modulated lasers (EMLs), laser drivers, modulator drivers and photodiode receivers for 100G and beyond client side applications. It provides a switching solution for 100G coherent systems, such as its Multi-Cast Switch (MCS) product line. Its MCS uses its Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) photonic integration platform and consists of a complex array of switches, waveguides, taps, crossings and other functional elements manufactured on Silicon wafers using standard semiconductor processing equipment.Network Products and SolutionsThe Company designs and manufactures a range of products for optical communications networks and various other applications, where the networks operate at speeds less than 100G. It offers a range of application-specific passive optical functionalities in modules or sub-system configurations, which include arrayed waveguide grating based drop modules for multiplexing and demultiplexing in conventional ROADM nodes, as well as variable optical attenuators and tap power monitors for network monitoring and control. In addition to products for fiber optic communications, it also sells products for test and measurement, instrumentation, industrial and research applications.The Company competes with Accelink Technologies Co., Ltd., Broadcom Limited, Finisar Corporation, Innolight Technology Corporation, M/A-Com, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, Inc., NTT Electronics Corporation, Source Photonics, Inc., Oclaro, Inc., Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations, Inc., HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
