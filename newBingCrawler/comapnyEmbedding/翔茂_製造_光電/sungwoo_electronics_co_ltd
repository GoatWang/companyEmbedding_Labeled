An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: 2AFYG-SW15WL0261 is 2AFYG. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, -SW15WL0261, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.
