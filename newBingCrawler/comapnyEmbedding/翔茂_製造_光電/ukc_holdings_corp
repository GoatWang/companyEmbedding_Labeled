What We Do?



UKC Holdings is the leading company in providing semiconductor/electronic components in Japan and globally and it has started the commitment in renewable energy industry by supplying inverters and PV modules to customers. Since 2015, April 1st, UKC Holdings has acquired Dust Detection System (DDS) business from Tokyo Electron Taiwan Limited for further engagement in this industry.
           

Dust Detection System (DDS), the soiling loss monitoring solution for operation & maintenance (O&M) of large scale solar power plants, offers the real-time monitoring of dust impact on  PV module power loss and indicates the optimized cleaning timing for additional revenue boost.  Our customers can access and manage all the data through DDS web service 24/7anywhere. The plug-and-play hardware with one-stop web service provides the best solution to manage solar assets from regionally into globally.

Why Dust Detection System?



Large scale solar power plants are built to generate maximum electricity to secure targeted profit and high return of investment (ROI) for property owners and investors. The complete life period of large scale solar power plant is 25 years and how to ensure the plant to operate optimally and remain feasible over its lifespan is the real challenge. It has been discovered that the daily energy loss due to soiling can be over 20% in the long period without rainfall and this phenomenon is magnified in desert or long dry season areas. For utility scale photovoltaic power plant, high soiling level will lead to adverse effect on energy output up to thousands kWh and in consequence reduce the return of investment for investors. 

Dust Detection System (DDS) is the best monitoring solution to remotely examine soling loss and in further indicate the optimized cleaning timing to prevent kWh loss due to surface dirt/contamination on PV modules. For O&M entities which manages solar power plants decentralized regionally, DDS is the most power tool for arranging cleaning schedule to in consequence maximize working force utilization.
