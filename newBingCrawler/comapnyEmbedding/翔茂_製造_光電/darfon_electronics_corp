In the post-PC 21st century, all information and communication technology products will be closely connected with our daily lives. In a colorful communication world, Darfon's Multi-layer Ceramic Capacitor and Inductor are significant. This product addresses the market's application needs by combining technology from materials engineering, chemical engineering, electronic engineering, and mechanical engineering. MLCC/MLCI with different functions is Darfon's R&D goal, with R&D taking the direction of multi-levels and small scale. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, the company has surpassed other domestic companies in Taiwan by being first to develop a BME process and 0201 ulta-miniaturized size's MLCC. This product's 
				1 um thickness is top notch. Automated equipment and sound management systems ensure the quality of each end product.

關於達方


 



        達方電子成立於1997年，致力於精密元件之研發及製造，為客戶提供ODM與OEM「一次購足」的高品質整合服務，產品包括：週邊元件、電源暨儲能元件、整合元件暨材料與綠能四大產品線，廣泛應用於電腦、面板與消費性電子產品等，目前已是全球第一大筆記型電腦鍵盤製造商。
		達方全球專利數近1300件，並榮獲多項國際設計大獎肯定，於2007年11月股票公開上市。截至2014年底，達方營業額已達7.1億美金，全球營運據點分佈於台灣、中國大陸、日本、韓國、美國、捷克等，全球員工人數近20,000人。




 


達方電子全球營運總部介紹


　



　
達方電子於2010年2月8日正式遷入全新的全球營運總部中心，新總部為地下四層、地上十層的大樓，土地面積達4,631坪，樓地板面積為15,700坪，可容納員工1,300人，建築物採「清水模」建築工法，外觀十分簡潔、素雅。在龜山工業區內，以高度及規模而言，皆是最醒目、最具代表性的地標性建築。
　
新總部大樓所採用的「清水模」建築工法，即混凝土灌漿凝固拆模後，不再於結構表面加上任何修飾，完全以混凝土的質感作為建築表現素材，讓建築物的外觀不僅質樸，更加環保。因應節能減碳的趨勢，達方全球營運總部中心採取最先進的環保節能低碳「綠建築」作法，所有的外牆玻璃皆採節能帷幕玻璃，玻璃與玻璃中間夾著氬氣，可有效阻隔熱氣，進而達到降溫的目的。此外，藉由雨水回收系統，可在下雨時將大樓屋頂與綠地的雨水自動集中至筏基，經過處理、過濾之後，直接作為廁所或灌溉用水，直到這五十頓的雨水使用完畢後，才會開始使用自來水，可說是善用每一滴水資源。 
         
		
全球營運總部內，除了新總部大樓有著經典的清水模建築外觀，總部內廣種植栽，庭園內翠綠翁鬱，綠林綿迭。值得一提的是，達方特別不辭辛勞地將在舊廠陪伴同仁一同打拼、樹齡近三十年以上的老樟樹們遷移至新廠，未來，達方要繼續與這些老朋友們一起成長、茁壯。
        　
　


        　達方新總部大樓擁有規格與品質皆符合國際比賽標準的室內籃球場館，採光極佳，當冷氣風管風速降低後，則是同仁練習羽毛球的理想場地；此外，可容納二百人的階梯型國際會議廳配備有百萬音響，定期舉辦電影欣賞、座談會、藝文活動等。其他還有視野與採光良好的專業健身房、韻律教室等休閒設施，讓達方同仁們在辛苦工作之餘，亦可培養良好的運動習慣，兼顧身心平衡發展。

The Who is Who of design companies on Red Dot 21
The best design products of well-known manufacturers and design brands from around the world can be found on Red Dot 21 in the “Manufacturers” menu item. Hundreds of manufacturers from every corner of the globe have been included. Some are small or medium-sized businesses, some are start-ups, others are international, stock-market listed corporations. Despite all these differences, they have one thing in common, the ambition to offer their customers particularly well-designed products. They have all understood what Thomas J. Watson Jr., the one-time CEO of IBM, meant when he said, “Good design is good business.” These companies know that consumers are increasingly aware of quality, and they understand that design is an important criterion in purchasing decisions. Many firms have also realised that the design of a product says a lot about a company’s power of innovation, its quality performance and the benefit the customer derives from the product. That is why they make targeted investments in design and try in this way to differentiate themselves from competition.
Sustained design performance and powers of innovation
There are companies who manage to achieve this with particular skill, sustained design performance and powers of innovation over a long period of time. Every year, the Red Dot Award: Product Design recognises this and awards one of these organisations the honorary title “Red Dot: Design Team of the Year” for its sustained design performance and powers of innovation. In the past, the title has gone to, among others, Sony, Apple, Mercedes, Audi, Miele, LG Electronics, LG, Porsche, BMW, Pininfarina, Bose, Lenovo, Grohe, adidas, Hilti and Blackmagic Design. But smaller and less well-known design brands also achieve great things with their products and are worthy of your attention.
Take a look at the self-portraits of one or other of these manufacturers if a product is of particular interest to you. You will also find the business address and a link to the website, as well as information on further design products made by the same company.
