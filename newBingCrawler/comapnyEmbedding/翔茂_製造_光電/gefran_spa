  Ask for Price✓Thanks for Contacting Us.GFXTERMO4 is a multi-loop control system that controls four process loops in a completely independent manner. Configuration of I/O resources is very rapid and flexible thanks to a programming tool that guides the user in the selection of parameters. Each control loop has- field bus to integrate with architectures that already use industrial field buses such as Profibus DP, CAN open, Device Net, Modbus RTU, Ethernet Modbus TCP. The presence of intelligence directly on the board lets the user create fully independent and reliable controls. The device installs on the DIN rod or with two M4 screws.Features:
Process input Input for external CTs or CT / linear input Control output Cooling output other auxiliary I/OsTwo digital inputs Two relay outputs the use of two independent serial ports provides efficient communication ability. The two serials are defined as followsUses Modbus RTU protocol and reaches a speed of 115 KbpsOther Details:

Gefran's PID controller, the 1350, has successfully addressed end-user pain points regarding display viewability by increasing the size of the display screen and offering customization based on end-user needs.



Frost & Sullivan recognizes Gefran with the 2015 Global Product Leadership Award.

"The 1350 has a large display area measuring 83 mm x 68 mm (the biggest display area in its category), which enables operators to easily read the settings, alarms and messages," said Frost & Sullivan Research Analyst Archit Kohli. "The controller has three displays; the first shows the actual present value, the second shows the set point, and the third checks for direct and immediate interaction during the initial configuration and operation."
The 1350 has an energy monitor function that can alert the user of a possible breakdown and helps prevent unexpected system shutdowns by giving operators ample time to schedule maintenance in advance. Similarly, it also detects machine error and recommends remedial action to save users time.
Meanwhile, the controllers can be configured easily with the GF_eXpress programming tool for the computer. Gefran's PID controllers can be connected to a communication network using the MODBUS communication standard, which is one of the most widely adopted industrial communication standards.
The company is one of the first to develop a PID controller with a message storage facility and can store up to 300 messages. The solution is customized to the users' needs, and the operators can choose from three languages.
The temperature on the controller is visible at a distance due to its large numbers and a white-on-black contrast on a large liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. Gefran has also ensured that the controller is a user-friendly human machine interface and highly configurable because the customer can require the desired frame color.
The 1350, which has the largest display, is supported by Zapper, a portable, battery-powered configurator that allows the operator to save and store up to four programs. Additionally, operators can copy/paste parameters when the PID controller power supply is off. The packaging of the controller is specifically studied to allow the configuration of the product "on the shelf".
Each year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has developed a product with innovative features and functionality, gaining rapid acceptance in the market. The award recognizes the quality of the solution and the customer value enhancements it enables.
