 　　As the director of FPSCPPIA (Fluoroplastics Processing Subcommittee China Plastics Processing Industry Association), Jiashan East Fluorine Plastics Factory is specialized in producing Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) products. In 2007, we were awarded "most developing enterprise prize" in the leading enterprises of China Fluoroplastics Processing Industry.
　　At present, we mainly produce ram extruded tubing, paste extruded tubing, molded rod, molded sheet, skived sheet, skived tape, thread seal tape, joint sealant, adhesive tape, anticorrosive tape, gasket, valve seat, braided packing, encapsulated O ring; they are widely used in chemical industry, mechanical industry, electronic industry, pharmaceutical industry, environment industry, aerospace industry and aviation industry, etc. As an ISO9001:2000 approved company, we are working hard to expand our business and develop new products. We developed liquid crystal electronic film in 2007, and our CNY 10 millions of products were sold into market; according to our estimation, we will sell CNY 16 millions of products in 2008. Now, we are the only manufacture of liquid crystal electronic film in China, and we build dust-free plant for this product. With the help of Professor Shi Weixing in Tongji University, we successfully developed super high molecular engineering plastic slide block for the bases of hi-speed railway and expressway in Oct., 2007; this product has passed the authentications of IBG and Manrer. Now, Shanghai Xinade International Trade Company is assessed our factory about the authentication of production. We develop PTFE (suspension resin) millipore filtration film in November, 2007; it has obtained good application effects in filtration of water, power plant and filtration of ignited fume of garbage, and it is a good material for the separation of water and oil. At present, it has been put into market.  [ Click for details ]
