Microsemi Corporation and HMS Industrial Networks Announce Availability of HMS's Anybus CompactCom 40-Series Products
Sep 16 15
Microsemi Corporation and HMS Industrial Networks announced the availability of HMS's Anybus CompactCom 40-series products for industrial Ethernet solutions based on Microsemi's SmartFusion2 system-on-chip (SoC) field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. The highly secure device offers customers lower total cost of ownership and accelerated time-to-market with low power and secure industrial Ethernet protocol conversion solutions on a single SmartFusion2 FPGA platform. HMS's Anybus CompactCom 40-series products offer hardware solutions specifically designed for factory automation applications including programmable logic controllers (PLCs), motor drives, motion drive control and safety modules, as well as other applications for industrial customers. HMS products are available in chip, brick and module product offerings, allowing customers to avoid designing ASSP/ASIC-specific boards for each industrial Ethernet standard. Customers can use HMS's CompactCom 40-series and program Microsemi's FPGA to the desired industrial Ethernet protocol standards with the intellectual property (IP) and software stack for the ARM® Cortex-M3 microcontroller in SmartFusion2. Collaborations between Microsemi and ecosystem solutions providers like HMS align well with Microsemi's commitment to the growing industrial Ethernet market. Microsemi's highly secure SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA offers layered hardware and software solutions to protect the IP, platform, manufacturing flow and data layer according to a customer's specific needs. The low power FPGA architecture also enables use of the device in compact solutions such as the Anybus CompactCom 40-series products from HMS. Should customers need to connect their industrial Ethernet boards to a larger network, Microsemi offers Ethernet switches and PHYs, Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) integrated circuits (ICs) and midspan products to complement HMS's industrial Ethernet solutions.
