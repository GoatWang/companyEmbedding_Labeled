PET 




 



	We’re pioneers in PET technology, and still innovating every day.

PET containers are light, damage resistant and easily shapeable. So you can create a multitude of forms. They are particularly good for enhancing product visibility in transparent containers. And PET is fully recyclable, making it even more appealing to image conscious sellers and buyers alike.

PET containers are manufactured in a single-stage or two-stage process. The single-stage process combines the injection and blow molding processes of preforms. The two-stage process has separate injection for the preforms, and separate blow molding in which the preform is stretched and blown to its final shape. In many cases more than one technology is used. Graham’s technologies are all patented and proprietary, employing different barrier materials and processes to reach the best solution.

PET Technologies






	ThermaSet®

	The future of food packaging:  our patented technology for shatter resistant, lightweight and eco-friendly PET jars which are a drop-in replacement to glass in hot fill and hold, pasteurized and retort applications – delivering savings to your business.

	 



	AeroPET®

	Our new AeroPET® bottles deliver all the performance and convenience of metal aerosols with the benefits of plastic. Capable of meeting all DOT and current FEA specifications while offering a lightweight customizable bottle, AeroPET® is the future of aerosol packaging.



	REFPET™

	For almost 30 years, Graham has been a world leader in refillable, returnable PET soft drink container technology.



Click here for Spanish video >

	Variable Displacement Base™

	VDB is a hot-fill technology that absorbs vacuum in the base of the container, freeing the side walls of structural geometry.

	SURSHOT®

	Graham Packaging works with customers to develop designs and specifications for plastic bottles having appearance and performance criteria desired by the customer, and to manufacture plastic bottles to customers’ designs and specifications.  Where multi-layer technology may provide the appearance or performance requirements for the customer package, Graham Packaging Design Services will provide design solutions that utilizes SURSHOT® injection molding technology.

	EPET

	Graham has taken what was previously a niche product for clear handled bottles and made it affordable to vastly more markets with proprietary manufacturing techniques.

	Barrier

	Protect your investment with proprietary Graham innovation. Graham utilizes various barriers in PET and other container technologies. They can be customized as an active barrier which absorbs oxygen or a passive barrier which blocks oxygen. Graham is the world’s leading producer of PET mono-layer and multi-layer barrier containers with combined sales of more than 2 billion units. So you can count on us for solutions that are easily mass-produced with speed and completely market-proven.

	G-Lite®

	Oval, rectangular, round or square containers weigh less without sacrificing integrity or performance.

	Escape

	Our proprietary Escape technology removes all vacuum allowing for more lightweighting. Weighing in at 20% less than others, it’s the lightest commercial hot-fill technology available. Escape gives you the power to create panel-less containers and unique shapes, with far more design flexibility than vacuum panel bottles. It’s yet another first for Graham Packaging, the industry leader in exploration and innovation.

Greater Material Choice
From Idea to Proof of Concept
Translating product requirements into product performance. How do you assess the entire range of biocompatible materials available for use in your medical device component – function, purpose, cost, availability? Is it a complex array of several of these variables? What happens when the choice on the drawing board doesn’t happen to readily exist?
We focus on balancing function and production through a proven process. Our innovative development team doesn’t just focus on functional requirements. We consider long-term manufacturability and delivery needs from the start.
Strict adherence to customer’s requirements begins with strict adherence to confidentiality

Good morningThe new DenseLight product “SLED Sets” (Broadband Fiber-Coupled Light Sources) and scope of possible applications:  demonstrated by the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA:Apr. 2008 - A Combined Multiple-SLED Broadband Light Source at 1300 nm for High Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography - Method and resultsThe new combined broadband SLED source was generated by combing four SLEDs which were independently driven. To generate a broadband spectrum with the smallest ripples possible, each of the SLEDs was chosen according to their central wavelength and output power. The layout of the combination is shown in Fig. 1. S1325 (Inphenix, USA) has a central wavelength of 1325 nm, a full width half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of about 70 nm, and an output power of 15 mW. S1325 has similar specifications as the SLEDs popularly used singly in OCT systems. SLED S1355 (Denselight, Singapore) has a central wavelength of 1350 nm, a FWHM bandwidth of 50 nm, and an output power of 15 mW. The third and fourth SLEDs (S1265 and S1380) were custom built by WT&T (Canada) and have center wavelength at 1265 nm and 1380 nm. The center wavelength of S1265 and S1380 can be tuned over a 10 nm range. The spectrum of each SLED is shown in Fig. 2(a).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3858014/and demonstrated by School of Engineering & Department of Industrial Electronics, University of Minho, Portugal 15 May2013 - Photonic Sensors Based on Flexible Materials with FBGs for Use on Biomedical Applicationsplease see, on the left, Figure 2 ( Oplink and Ibsen Photonics are customer of DenseLight)This chapter presented biomedical applications for acquisition systems based on FBGs. The absence of mechanical steps on sensor’s fabrication results in the possibility to fabricate high sensitivity sensors with high reproducibility of their characteristics. However, the most important features that made FBG-based systems a wide established technology were their electrically passive operation, electromagnetic interference immunity, compact size, self referencing capability, and more important, inherent multiplexing-ability, which enable a wide number of sensors in a single fiber as well as Bragg a single interrogation systemhttp://www.intechopen.com/books/current-trends-in-short-and-long-period-fiber-gratings/photonic-sensors-based-on-flexible-materials-with-fbgs-for-use-on-biomedical-applicationsCheers
