Market value rises 14% in 2015, rising product prices and government support for industries being the recipe for growth during the year. Malaysia and Vietnam emerge as the leading import countries, after 146% and 294% growth in imports’ value over 2015. Rising prices drive up the industry’s value by 3%, while a cheap rouble and import substitution programme elevate companies’ competitive strength in 2015. Foreign companies such as LG seek to optimise Russian operations by increasing component sourcing from local suppliers. Leading companies Mikron PAO, Svetlana PAO, VZPP-S AO, Elekond AO and Angstrem AO boost R&D activities seeking to develop alternatives for foreign products. Industry’s success set to remain dependent on government’s support programmes, potentially leading to turnover value CAGR of 6% over 2015-2020.
