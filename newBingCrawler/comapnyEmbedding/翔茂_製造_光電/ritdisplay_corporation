RiteDia
 RiteDia is a subsidiary of RITEK Group, the world leader in the manufacture of storage media, OLED, touch panel and electrical conducting paste. RiteDia was incorporated in March 2011 with a capital amount of about NT200M. RiteDia is an IP company with a portfolio of more than 100 international patents. Most are related to advanced materials, such as diamond products, diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings, and graphene dispersants. 

                                    The major focus of RiteDia's products are DiamondInside(TM) LED products. The unique feature is to coat DLC on blue chips of GaN on sapphire within one micron of the MQW (multiple quantum wells) where photons are generated with twice amount energy in heat. DLC can dessipate heat much faster than even silver, the metal with the highest thermal conductivity. Consequently, the closeby coating of DLC is effective to eliminate hot spots in LED chips and prevent the deterioration of light decay. LED's biggest enemy is overheating so DLC is LED's best friend. RiteDia is the world's only company capable of eliminate hot spots in real time. All other companies that are specialized in thermal management of LED packages can only remove heat far out the MQW so their solutions may not be effective.

Founder[edit]
Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai, founder of RITEK Corporation, started to manufacture and market vinyl records in 1957. In 1958, he published the album “Green Island Serenade”, the hit by Zi Wei, the famous signer of that time. At that time, the production process was completely manual. Waste gases and toxic chemical solutions were all over the manufacturing environment at the high temperature of 45 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the materials deteriorated easily and as a result, the yield was low. Quality depended entirely on the experience of manufacturing supervisors. From materials to production, the process cost a lot of time and money. It was a tough business indeed. During this period, Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai made improvements in different aspects. He introduced new technologies and machines from Japan, looked for new materials and developed new manufacturing processes. With the advancement in both software and hardware, the vinyl record industry in Taiwan finally left behind the old, tired and toxic environment, and began to churn out higher quality products.
Due to the insufficient of the recording equipment and facilities in Taiwan at that time, Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai felt it would be necessary to preserve Peking Opera, Nan-Guan and Bei-Guan as educational and cultural heritage. In 1980, he invested a significant amount on the creation of Platinum Studio in 1980, by importing from Switzerland a 24-track recorder. It was the first multitrack recorder in Taiwan. The studio also invited technicians from Japan to give instructions. It was at that juncture that Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai learned that the Japanese people were starting to produce compact disks. In 1985, the R&D and ramp-up of compact disks were transforming the record industry as a new material and technology. Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai realized that digitalization was the trend for the record industry and he immediately initiated on R&D activities on compact disks.
RITEK Corporation was established in 1988 with efforts to manufacture compact disks. In 1990, the company successfully produced the first compact disk in Taiwan and put an end to Taiwan’s reliance on imports from Japan. This also directly contributed to the booming of the local music market. Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai has been dedicating to the development of the music and storage industry, from the manufacturing of vinyl to compact disks, over nearly six decades and across two centuries. He is a pioneer of the record industry in Taiwan and a driver of the local pop music. RITEK Corporation, founded by Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai, is now a world leading manufacturer in compact disks, from music CD, audio DVD to Blu-ray disks.

Former Chairman of RITEK Corporation, Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai, set up Min Li Plastics (明理塑膠工廠) after he graduated. The factory produced plastic cigarette boxes and polyethylene milk bottles. During that period, he purchased a second hand electroplating tool from Japan, with the original intention of plating chromium on plastics to enhance durability. However, this didn’t work out. He then moved to electroplate copper and nickel on the stampers of vinyl records. This was how he got into the record business. Meanwhile, Mr. Yeh Ching-Tai established First Vintage Record and Platinum Studio.
