	Canare Electric Co., Ltd. operates in the Radio & TV communications equipment sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Canare Electric Co., Ltd. with three other
	
			companies in this sector in Japan:
		
	Media Links Co Ltd
	
		(2016
	sales of 5.65 billion Japanese Yen [US$51.24  million]
		of which 82%
		was Hardware product),
	
	Nippon Antenna Co., Ltd.
	
		(16.38 billion Japanese Yen [US$148.55  million]
		of which 79%
		was Manufacturing), and
	
	NCXX Group Inc
	
		(12.23 billion Japanese Yen [US$110.94  million]
		of which 74%
		was Device Business).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	Canare Electric Co., Ltd. reported sales of ¥10.66 billion (US$96.65 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
				an
			
			increase of 2.3%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were ¥10.42 billion.
	
			Sales at Canare Electric Co., Ltd. have increased during each of the previous five years
		
		(and since 2011, sales have increased a total of 31%).
	
		Sales of Operating Segment-Japan saw an increase
		
			that was more than double the company's growth rate: sales were up
		10.5% in 2016, from
		¥6.16 billion to ¥6.81 billion.
		
			Not all segments of Canare Electric Co., Ltd. experienced an increase in sales in 2016:
			sales of Operating Segment-Taiwan fell 21.8% to ¥160.00 million.
			
				(However, this segment's sales were only a very small portion of the company's overall sales).
