Ascent Solar Adds New Series of Products to its BIPV/BAPV Product Portfolio
-Launches 5 Meter Long Modules with 320 Watts Output and Easy to 
      Install Design

-Module to Be Showcased at Solar Power International in October

THORNTON, Colo., Sep 07, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTI), 
      a developer of flexible thin-film solar modules, announced today the 
      launch of its new WaveSol(TM) series of five meter long modules to 
      complement its current portfolio of building integrated (BIPV) and 
      building applied (BAPV) photovoltaic product portfolio.
WaveSol(TM) WSLB 3200-190 is the highest power 5 meter flexible and 
      light-weight CIGS module available and another example of Ascent Solar's 
      dedication to and heritage of producing flexible light-weight high power 
      CIGS modules with large format (5.0m X 0.6m), high power (320 Watts), 
      high voltage (up to 190 Volts) and high specific power (50 Watts/kg). 
      This new series of products is enabled by recent advances in our CIGS 
      monolithic integration process resulting in our new 30 cm x 60 cm 
      building blocks which are four times the size of the current building 
      block sub-modules. The module family consists of fewer parts that reduce 
      overall internal power losses and significantly reduces manufacturing 
      and testing operations. This product is specifically designed to meet 
      the needs of large commercial scale rooftop installations by providing 
      unique attributes that reduce BOS costs and ease of integration into 
      roofing components in a way this industry has yet to experience. Ascent 
      Solar plans to showcase the product in October of this year during the 
      Solar Power International conference to be held in Los Angeles, CA.
Ascent Solar President and CEO Farhad Moghadam added, "We are proud of 
      our heritage and unwavering dedication to flexible CIGS solar module 
      manufacturing. We intend to maintain our leading position as the 
      pre-eminent manufacturer of flexible, light-weight CIGS modules for 
      BIPV/BAPV solutions by translating advances in production into 
      world-leading modules that will enable the proliferation of solar while 
      making it a cost effective solution. We look forward to showcasing this 
      module to the world during the Solar Power International convention next 
      month, as well as planning several beta site installations with existing 
      customers."

Technology[edit]
Ascent Solar's thin-film solar modules are manufactured from CIGS cells using copper indium gallium (di)selenide semiconductor (CIGS), which has shown a 10.5% NREL efficiency in real-world conditions. What makes this proprietary technology unique, however, is its relative size, weight and flexibility: Ascent's CIGS panels currently allow for 85 watts/meter, and 48 watts/kg, thereby giving them the greatest power density and weight ratio among available flexible photovoltaic products[2] by a significant margin. This allows for the efficient use of solar power in a range of new contexts, in which size or weight restrictions have previously rendered solar power impracticable: e.g., cell phones, airplanes, unmanned vehicles, consumer electronics, railways, space programs, and off-grid applications. This developing technology was selected as one of the 100 Most Innovative Technologies for 2010 by R&D Magazine,[3] and as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2011 by Time Magazine.[4]
Market history[edit]
Ascent Solar entered the manufacturing stage for its products in 2013, in part by teaming up with a range of other companies like TFG Radiant (for integrating these materials into a range of building and construction materials), Foxconn (for a "pilot project" at the Zhengzhou Factory, which is currently manufacturing the iPhone 5),[5] and Bye Aerospace (for solar-powered unmanned aircraft).[6]
It has also launched in 2013 the Enerplex brand. EnerPlex represents the consumer side of Ascent Solar, integrating Ascent’s transformational CIGS technology into products which consumers use every day. Through EnerPlex, Ascent has pivoted into the consumer space with the aim to put solar in the hands of every consumer.
EnerPlex[edit]
EnerPlex is a brand of solar and electronic consumer products launched by Ascent Solar, Inc.[7] EnerPlex products utilizes Ascent Solar’s leading edge CIGS solar technology to bring solar charging solutions to remote and unprecedented places. Unlike traditional glass backed panels, the panels integrated into all EnerPlex products are rugged, lightweight and flexible, monolithically integrated on plastic (not glass) substrate; providing limitless possibilities for innovation.
Its product line ranges from smart phone chargers to other consumer products. Its latest product is the Kickr IV, a less than 12 ounces solar charger equipped with a standard USB port that can charge a wide variety of portable electronic devices from rechargeable batteries, to tablets, phones, GPS, digital cameras, eReaders and portable music players, charging them as fast as if they were plugged into an outlet.
Corporate history[edit]
Ascent Solar was founded in 2005 by ITN Energy Systems, a company engaged in commercializing emerging energy technologies through spin-offs and joint ventures.[8] During the first few years of operation, its primary focus was to research the CIGS thin-film technology as well as researching efficient methods for manufacturing.[9][needs update]
On July 18, 2006, Ascent completed its IPO, releasing 3,000,000 shares at 5.50 USD per share.[10] In June 2007, Norsk Hydro ASA, a Norwegian based supplier of aluminum products, entered into a deal with Ascent whereby it purchased 23% of Ascent shares with the option to increase that stake to up to 35%, which it did on October 7, 2008. On September 22, 2008, Ascent's then CEO, Matthew Foster, stepped down from his position. His reason for doing so was cited as an agreement between him and the company as the company changed from research-driven to production-driven. He will remain with Ascent as a consultant for an additional year after his retirement date.[11] On March 11, 2009, Ascent Solar commenced regular production at their facility in Colorado. The company began with a one-shift production schedule.

 Ascent Solar debuts newest EnerPlex product – pv magazine International                 Skip to content  Ascent Solar debuts newest EnerPlex productAscent Solar Technologies, Inc. announced today the release of the companys newest consumer product, the EnerPlex Kickr IV, now available for sale on www.EnerPlex.biz/Kickr November 12, 2012 Ascent Solar Technologies The EnerPlex Kickr IV is a rugged, lightweight and compact solar charging solution, perfect for a day at the beach, a week in the backcountry, a picnic in the park or even placed on the dashboard driving to work. The durable and lightweight attributes of the product set it apart from competitors using traditional rigid, heavy and fragile crystalline-based solar panels. To view a commercial video and pictures of this exciting new product as well as product specifications, please visit www.EnerPlex.biz/Kickr. Victor Lee, Ascents President & CEO, said, The EnerPlex Kickr IV brings to consumers the ability to transform the way they charge and use electronics in their everyday lives. EnerPlex Kickr IV users no longer need to be on lookout for the nearest outlet, or plan their day around a phones battery life. In support of the ongoing relief efforts being conducted along the East Coast in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, Ascent Solar has pledged 10% of revenues beginning today, through the end of the year from its EnerPlex product line to support the American Red Cross as they help families recover from this devastating tragedy. Mr. Lee continued, We are saddened by the devastating effects of Superstorm Sandy, but are encouraged by the support and efforts of friends, neighbors and families as all help to recover from this tragedy. We at Ascent feel thankful that we have the opportunity to help the American Red Cross in their support and recovery efforts.http://www.AscentSolar.com PreviousNew Energy Husum 2013 expands its portfolio   NextClenergys Jiayuguan 40MW project contract increased to 52MW RelatedLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
