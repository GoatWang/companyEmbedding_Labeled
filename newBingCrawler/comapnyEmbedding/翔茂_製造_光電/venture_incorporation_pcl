History[edit]
In 1911, Joseph O. Eaton, brother-in-law Henning O. Taube and Viggo V. Torbensen, incorporated the Torbensen Gear and Axle Co. in Bloomfield, New Jersey. With financial backing from Torbensen's mother, the company was set to manufacture Torbensen's patented internal-gear truck axle. In 1914, the company moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to be closer to its core business, the automotive industry.
The Torbensen Axle Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1916, succeeding the New Jersey corporation. A year later, Republic Motor Truck Company, Torbensen's largest customer bought out the company. But Eaton and Torbensen were not content and bowed out of Republic to form the Eaton Axle Company in 1919. A year later, in 1920, Eaton Axle Company merged with Standard Parts. Standard Parts went in receivership later the same year and was later liquidated. In 1923, Eaton bought the Torbensen Axle Co. back from Republic and changed the name to the Eaton Axle and Spring Company.
Eaton officers believed the quickest way to grow the business was through acquisitions and began buying companies in the automotive industry. By 1932, the diversified company changed its name to Eaton Manufacturing Company. In 1937, Eaton became international by opening a manufacturing plant in Canada. In 1958 Eaton Corporation acquired Fuller Manufacturing. The company name changed once again in 1965 to Eaton Yale & Towne Inc. after the acquisition of Yale & Towne Manufacturing Co. in 1963. Stockholders approved the change to the company's current name in 1971. In 1978, Eaton Corporation acquired Samuel Moore & Company, Kenway Systems, and Cutler-Hammer in 1978.[6][7][citation needed]
Current work[edit]
Eaton's business comprises two sectors: Electrical and Industrial:
Electrical sector[edit]
Electrical Americas & Electrical Rest of World Segments[edit]
The Electrical Sector is a global leader in power distribution, power quality, industrial automation and power control products and services.[citation needed] Products include circuit breakers, switchgear, UPS systems, power distribution units, panelboards, loadcenters, motor controls, meters, sensors, relays and inverters. The principal markets for the Electrical Americas and Electrical Rest of World segments are industrial, institutional, government, utility, commercial, residential, information technology and original equipment manufacturer customers.
Industrial sector[edit]
Hydraulics group[edit]
Eaton is a manufacturer of systems and components for use in mobile and industrial applications. Markets include agriculture, construction, mining, forestry, utility, material handling, machine tools, molding, power generation, primary metals, and oil and gas. The Hydraulics group also includes Eaton's Filtration, Golf Grip and Airflex industrial clutch and brake businesses.
Aerospace group[edit]
For the aerospace industry, Eaton manufactures and markets a line of systems and components for hydraulic, fuel, motion control, pneumatic systems and engine solutions.
Vehicle group[edit]
The Vehicle Group comprises the company's truck and automotive segments.
The truck segment is involved in the design, manufacture and marketing of powertrain systems and other components for commercial vehicle markets. Key products include manual and automated transmissions, clutches and hybrid power.
Eaton’s automotive segment produces products such as superchargers, engine valves, valve train components, cylinder heads, locking and limited-slip differentials, fuel, emissions, and safety controls, transmission and engine controls, spoilers, exterior moldings, plastic components, and fluid connectors.
Acquisitions[edit]
Eaton Electrical purchased the Westinghouse Distribution and Controls Business Unit in 1994 which was also one of Eaton's largest acquisitions.[8] The acquisition included all of the Westinghouse electrical distribution and control product business and also included stipulations that the Westinghouse name cannot be used by anyone else on these types of products for years. Today, Eaton Electrical manufactures electrical distribution and control products branded "Eaton" or "Cutler-Hammer" which can replace Westinghouse products in commercial and industrial applications.
Eaton spun off its semiconductor manufacturing equipment business as Axcelis Technologies in 2000.
In 2003, Eaton's Electrical Distribution and Control business (formerly known as Cutler-Hammer) acquired the electrical division of Delta plc. This acquisition brought Delta's brands Holec, MEM, Tabula, Bill and Elek under the Eaton nameplate[9] with the previous Westinghouse divisions and gave the company manufacturing facilities to meet IEC standards, one of the steps to become a global company and developing a worldwide standard.
Soon after this acquisition, Eaton entered a joint venture with Caterpillar Inc. and purchased 51% of I & S operations (now known as Intelligent Switchgear Organization, LLC).[10] This was followed in 2004 by the acquisition of Powerware.[11] The Powerware brand is known for the design and production of medium to large Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) devices. After several years of co-branding UPS products "Eaton|Powerware" the company is switching to the single brand Eaton for all UPS products including; BladeUPS, 9355, 9390, 9395, and 9E.
In 2006, Eaton entered the data center power distribution market. Initial products were internally developed PDU's and RPP's under the Powerware brand and included the PowerXpert metering system. A Powerware brand Static Transfer Switch was added to the portfolio through a brand-label relationship with Cyberex. To complete the power distribution portfolio Eaton released a line of rack power distribution products under its Powerware brand called ePDU. It acquired Aphel Technologies Ltd., a manufacturer of power distribution product for data centers based in Coventry, UK.[12] Shortly after, it added Pulizzi Engineering Inc., Santa Ana, CA-based manufacturer of mission critical power distribution.[13] In late 2007, it acquired the MGE Office Protection Systems division of Schneider Electric, as a result of Schneider's acquisition of APC. A Taiwanese manufacturer, Phoenixtec, was also acquired giving the company the highest share in the Chinese single-phase UPS market.[14]
On May 21, 2012 Eaton announced that they had agreed to purchase Ireland-based Cooper Industries in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $11.46 billion. The new company is called Eaton Corporation plc and is incorporated in Ireland. Then-Eaton Chairman and CEO Alexander Cutler headed the new corporation. Cooper shareholders received $39.15 in cash and 0.77479 of a share in the newly created company for each Cooper share held. This is worth $72 per share based on Eaton’s closing share price of $42.40 on May 18, 2012, and is 29% above Cooper’s closing stock price.[15] Eaton Corporation plc completed its acquisition of Cooper Industries on Nov 30, 2012. The $13 billion acquisition of Cooper (USD$5.4B Sales revenue -2011), became the largest in Eaton's (USD$16B Sales Revenue-2011) 101-year history.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
From 1920s-1964 Eaton was based on East 140th Street. In 1964, Eaton moved its headquarters into the new Erieview Tower where it remained until 1983. In that year, Eaton Corporation moved into a 28-story Cleveland office tower which was renamed for it.[17] Eaton relocated to its new 580,000 square foot facility, named Eaton Center, in Beachwood, Ohio in early 2013.[18] The reincorporation in Ireland as part of the Cooper merger involved establishing a registered head office in Dublin, Ireland but operational headquarters remain in Ohio.
Environmental record[edit]
Eaton was selected in 2008 as a recipient of the CALSTART Blue Sky Award with recognition for its environmentally "green" transportation investments, products and actions. The award was directed towards the company's efforts to pioneer heavy duty hybrid-drive technology for trucks. The annual awards recognize outstanding marketplace contributions to clean air, energy efficiency and to the clean transportation industry overall by companies, organizations and individuals.[19]
Operations of Eaton involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify certain processes on an ongoing, regular basis to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Eaton has set standards for itself in the category of environmental protection vowing to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent by 2012.[20]
In 2006, Eaton joined the Green Suppliers Network, a public-private partnership with the EPA and U.S. Department of Commerce, through which small and medium-sized suppliers are helped to develop "lean and clean" manufacturing processes.[21]
Eaton's hybrid electric powertrain combines a diesel engine and electric motor to drive the vehicle.[22]
In 2013, Eaton has been ranked a global leader by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and was named to the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. Eaton’s position in the index ranked it first among its global competitors in the industrials sector.[23]
Corporate recognition and rankings[edit]
Recognitions include the following:

Ranked #4 in "100 Best Corporate Citizens” of Corporate Responsibility Magazine in 2013, also ranking in Top 50 for Six Consecutive Years.[24]
Named to Thomson Reuters Top 100 Innovators List, 2011 - 2012 - 2013.[25]
Ranked Among the World’s Most Ethical Companies chosen by the Ethisphere Institute for 2007-2014 [26]

      Pertamina and PTT Global Chemical signed Petrochemical Marketing and Trading Joint Venture in Indonesia
    


        (Bangkok, 16 December 2013) PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (PTTGC) and PT Pertamina (Persero) signed Marketing and Trading-Joint Venture Agreements (Marketing & Trading JVA) to establish a joint venture company in Indonesia. The JV Company is targeted to seize the Indonesian domestic petrochemical market prior to the plan of world scale petrochemical complex development that expected to start its operation in 2018.
      

        Apart from the recent signing of Manufacturing Joint Venture-Heads of Agreement in December 10th, 2013, in Jakarta, PTTGC, the Thai leading Petrochemical producer and Pertamina, the Indonesian national energy company, have also advanced its partnership by signing the Marketing and Trading JVA for merging and expanding their polymer sales and distribution in Indonesia's market. The JVA will enable an establishment of joint venture company to serve a huge number of customers and to better accessing the market, prior to the incorporation of developing the petrochemical complex in Indonesia. The joint venture agreement has already been signed and is subject to further regulatory approvals for the joint venture company incorporation within the first quarter of next year.
      

        Bowon Vongsinudom, President and CEO of PTTGC, stated, "Today's signing marks another significant step forward for PTTGC's and Pertamina's commitment to strenghten our partnership for petrochemical business development in Indonesia. I'm truly delighted to see these progresses that we have made, and most impressed with this line-up of activities which no doubt will energize and vitalize the partnership between PTTGC and Pertamina. The partnership could build a venture that is well positioned in creating value for every end, especially for the Indonesian customers. The joint venture company business plan has been derived from the intensive market survey conducted jointly in the earlier stage."
      

        "Following the HOA signing last April for the potential collaboration, PTTGC has supported Pertamina with our polymer product to conduct their sales and marketing activities in Indonesia. We also shared with Pertamina our market and products knowledge, in order to scale up Pertamina's advancement on petrochemical business. On top of the gradually increasing volume of material supply from PTTGC, the joint venture company will also market Pertamina's polypropylene, produced in Plaju facility, fulfilling domestic needs and ramping up its foothold in this promising market." Said Bowon Vongsinudom.
      

        Hanung Budya, Marketing and Trading Director of Pertamina, stated, "As Karen, Pertamina President and CEO said earlier this year in the HOA signing ceremony last April, Indonesia has the best business potential for petrochemical product marketing in this region, the size of the unmet demand, supplied by imported products at the amount of US$5 billion per year and it's time for us to grab this opportunity. Here we come to materialize what we aimed for. The establishment of this marketing and trading joint venture company is definitely my pride and clearly in line with Pertamina's strategy in growing the downstream business, especially for petrochemical."
      

        "Having PTTGC on board, as a strategic partner, we believe that they could share its strong experience in the business. Today, I can confirm that PTTGC is truly the respectable and trustful partner. The joint project team has been working hard to meet the aggressive timeline. As a result, the cooperation between the two parties has made another key milestone of achievement." added Hanung Budya.
      

        Pertamina owns and operates 6 refineries throughout Indonesia. With the total capacity of around 1 million Barrel Crude Oil per day, it is ranked the 5th largest in Asia. In this regard, it has tremendous potential to integrate refinery and petrochemical business hence adds more values to the natural resources of Indonesia. With these advantages, Pertamina is determined to be a major player in Indonesia as well as in the region.
      

        PTT Global Chemical, as Chemical Flagship of the PTT Group, with the combined chemical / petrochemical capacity of 8.72 million tons per year and crude oil / condensate distillation capacity of 280,000 barrels per day. The Company has been expanding its business into the specialties and green chemicals through a number of oversea strategic acquisitions. Such investments also clearly represent PTT Global Chemical's growth aspiration to expand its business internationally.
