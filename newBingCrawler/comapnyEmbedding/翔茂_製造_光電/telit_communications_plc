Year end trading update: revenues up 13.4% to approximately $333.5m






January 11, 2016 01:16 PM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Telit Communications PLC (AIM: TCM, ‘the Group’, ‘Telit’), a global 
      leader in machine-to-machine (m2m) communications, has published its 
      year end trading update for the year ended 31 December 2015.
    


      Group revenues are expected to be approximately $333.5 million (2014: 
      $294 million), up 13.4%. The Group expects adjusted EBITDA to be in line 
      with guidance at $40-45 million.
    

      Within the Group’s overall revenues, the automotive division enjoyed 
      notable growth, with revenues expected to jump 60% to $39.6 million 
      (2014: $24.8 million).
    

      The IoT Services division (connectivity and Platform as a Service, PaaS) 
      is expected to show a 30% increase in revenue to approximately $26 
      million (2014: $20 million).
    

      Revenues for EMEA are expected to be $133.2 million (2014: $117.5 
      million), up 13.4%. After a few years of slowdown in the region, 2015 
      saw a return to double digit growth.
    

      Revenues for APAC are expected to be $70.9 million (2014: $40.8 
      million), up 73.8%. This significant growth was achieved following a 
      number of years of heavy investments across the region, including the 
      opening of business development and sales offices and the development of 
      a product roadmap that meets the region’s specific needs.
    

      After six years of strong growth, (2009 to 2015 CAGR revenue growth of 
      44%), the Americas revenues are expected to be $129.4 million (2014: 
      $135.7 million), down 4.6%. As previously announced, revenues in 2015 
      were affected by the faster than expected technology shift in the US 
      market, mainly as a result of the imminent shutdown of the 2G networks 
      and the resulting strong shift into 4G technology. This delayed product 
      deployments into 2016 when the Group’s LTE CAT 1 product line will be 
      ready for shipments. The Group expects this region will return to growth 
      in 2016.
    

      Net cash at 31 December 2015 was $1 million (31 December 2014: net debt 
      $3.9 million).
    

Oozi Cats, Chief Executive of Telit, said,
    

"2015 was another year of strong growth - all organic this year.
Over the last six years, we delivered a CAGR of revenue growth of 
      25%.


“In order to exploit the considerable opportunities across the 
      fast growing IoT industry, we have continued to invest across the Group, 
      particularly in products for automotive market as well for our 
      industrial product line and for our cloud platform infrastructure. With 
      the increasing need for services across the IoT industry, we expect our 
      IoT services business to continue to grow significantly over the next 
      few years.


“In addition to the Group’s revenue growth, we expect to benefit 
      from the operational leverage inherent in the organisation which will 
      enable us to improve margins and our ability to generate cash over the 
      next few years.


“With the numerous opportunities developing across the Group as 
      well as our growing recurring revenues, we are confident of maintaining 
      our double digit growth in the current financial year.”


      Telit expects to publish its results for the year ended 31 December 2015 
      on 7 March 2016.

Telit Wireless Solutions[edit]
Telit Wireless Solutions (TWS) is a subsidiary of Telit Communications PLC. Telit is a fast-growing wireless M2M company, addressing a worldwide market that amounts to €14 billion already today.[3] In terms of sales, Telit is ranked as the third-largest M2M module supplier worldwide by market research firm Berg Insight. Since 2005, the company has achieved steadily increasing sales.
Telit Wireless Solutions' headquarters are located in London, with regional headquarters in EMEA (Trieste, Italy), North America (Raleigh, North Carolina), Latin America (São Paulo, Brazil), and APAC (Seoul, Korea). The company has a wide network of sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, China, Denmark, Germany, France, India, Israel, Italy, Korea, Russia, Spain, the Republic of South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, the UK and the US.
Telit introduced the ball-grid-array (BGA) module, the “Family” and “Unified-Form-Factor” concepts and the smallest GPS receiver module. The company offers an extensive portfolio of cellular, short-range, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) modules. Its products are available in over 80 countries from 35 sales offices.
History[edit]
In 1986, the company started as Telital and Telital Automotive – an engineering company providing research and development services to multinational telecoms. In 1997, the company began manufacturing and marketing products under the Telital brand and a couple of years later, Telìt. Telit launched its first M2M module called Datablock in 1998. From 1997 on, millions of cellular handsets and other mobile communications devices including the first Globalstar satellite phone were to users and operators worldwide.
In 2006, with the acquisition of Bellwave, the APAC (Asia and Pacific) Telit's regional headquarters was opened in Seoul. At the same time, offices in North America were also opened in North Carolina creating Telit North America. Also in 2006 Telit premiered its telit2market magazine, an annual publication covering trends, opinions and market reports on M2M, along with the case studies and technology updates.
In 2008 Telit continued its global expansion with new regional operations, establishing sales offices and manufacturing in São Paulo, Brazil; sales offices in Johannesburg, South Africa and Ankara, Turkey.
In 2009 Telit acquired France-based One RF focused on development of 802.15.4, ZigBee® and proprietary low-power mesh-network modules. The deal included a full portfolio of IPR covering short-range protocol stacks. Telit also launched Infinita Services conceived to simplify M2M solution deployment and maintenance of device software. Launches a new short-range product family and the market’s smallest GSM/GPRS module, the GE865-QUAD.
In March 2011 Telit acquired Motorola Solutions' M2M modules business unit. The acquisition brought Telit’s consolidated pro forma revenues to approximately $180 million for the year ended 31 December 2010. This was equivalent to a pro forma market share of approximately 20% based on report by Beecham Research.[4]
In January 2012 Telit acquired Navman Wireless OEM Solutions, providers of Jupiter-brand GPS modules, for $3 million in cash. The acquisition gave Telit a dedicated GNNS research and development unit and access to customers outside the M2M module industry.[5]
In July 2012 Telit formed a new business unit, m2mAIR,[6] to offer M2M managed and value-added services including connectivity. m2mAIR offers module and subscription lifecycle management via a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform and global wireless coverage in partnership with Telefónica. The service was initially available in Europe with roll-outs scheduled in the U.S., APAC and Latin America later in 2013 .[7]
Later in 2012 Telit launched the Jupiter SL869 multi-constellation GNSS receiver supporting GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and QZSS; quickly followed by the 3D-SiP-based SE880, the market’s smallest and most sensitive full-featured GPS receiver.
In 2013 Telit acquired of CrossBridge Solutions expanding m2mAIR into North America.[8]
Telit Wireless Solutions Inc., a fully owned subsidiary of Telit Communications Plc, entered on September 4, 2013 into an agreement to purchase US-based (Boca Raton, FL) ILS Technology LLC, a leading provider of a ready-to-use, off-the-shelf, cloud platform to connect enterprise IT systems to m2m-connected devices and machines for business-critical use.
Telit Wireless Solutions Srl, a fully owned subsidiary of Telit Communications Plc, entered on December 22, 2013 into an agreement, subject to closing, with NXP B.V., a fully owned subsidiary of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (Nasdaq: NXPI) to purchase NXP’s ATOP business. The Board is pleased to announce that closing conditions for completion of the acquisition have been fulfilled and closing is expected to occur on March 31, 2014.[9]
Today, Telit develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of enterprise communication modules including all relevant wireless technologies for M2M applications enabling machines, devices and vehicles to communicate via mobile networks. Telit owns Protocol Stacks for most of its technologies of cellular and short range wireless modules. Its m2m module portfolio include products in GSM/GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, EV-DO, HSPA, LTE and CDMA products as well as short-range modules in Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Short Range RF (proprietary mesh and point-to-point networks for unlicensed frequency bands), Wireless MBus and GPS/GLONASS (Machine-to-Machine) modules. Its xE910 family of wireless modules features a single form factor that is interchangeable on regional cellular networks.
Telit remains the only company to publish an M2M trade magazine telit2market. Released regularly once a year, it is a reference for current developments and new technological advancements in the M2M market.

Telit operates eight R&D centers around the globe that are located in Trieste (Italy), Sardinia (Italy), Caen (France)/Leuven (Belgium), Seoul (South Korea), Tel Aviv (Israel), Boca Raton (Florida, USA) Chicago (Illinois, USA) and Foothill Ranch (California, USA).
The R&D facility in Trieste is the company’s main engineering, design & development facility, and headquarters for the global R&D function. Trieste focuses its brain-trust in the advancement of GSM, GPRS, EDGE, and GPS technologies. Telit's Sardinia R&D center is the primary competence center for other wireless technologies and special projects. This facility investigates short-range wireless, satellite, and other emerging technologies. The Center distributed between two R&D facilities of Telit acquired NXP-ATOP, Caen (France) and Leuven (Belgium) houses 30+ engineers dedicated to the research and development effort for the company's Automotive Solutions business unit.
Telit's APAC R&D center in Seoul is the main development site for the company's CDMA, WCDMA, and UMTS projects. It is also Telit's center of competence for automotive specific products and rugged design technologies. The team in Tel Aviv supports the other R&D centers worldwide in the cellular sector. The Boca Raton R&D Center is the world headquarter site for ILS Technology acquired in September 2013 and houses engineering and R&D in charge of advancing cloud technology and the company's application enablement platform (AEP). The Lincolnshire R&D Center is located in the Chicago area, U.S.A. This R&D team is responsible for m2mAIR North America product development including constant improvement to one of the region's most modern Network Operations Centers (NOC) dedicated to m2m. Telit's Foothill Ranch R&D center near Los Angeles is focused on GPS, QZSS, Galileo, Compass and related location-based projects.

The security market segment is expected to be an early adopter of LTE Cat1. 


 

Telit has agreed to acquire several cellular module product lines from Novatel Wireless








Telit Communications PLC (LON:TCM), the industrial Internet of Things specialist, has acquired some intellectual property (IP) and related assets from Novatel Wireless, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIFI).

	The initial cash purchase price is $11mln, plus a conditional earn-out clause that Telit expects will not be a material amount.

	Telit will take control of several cellular module product lines and their related IP, and has been granted an exclusive licence over other Novatel IP related to the acquired product lines, plus subsequent versions currently in development.

	The acquisition falls firmly into the “bolt-on” category, with Telit saying that although the acquisition enhances its product offering in the security market segment, it is not expected to have a big impact on the group's financial performance.

	"The acquisition of these products and associated IP strengthens Telit's position in the security market segment, a segment that is expected to be an early adopter of LTE Cat1. The acquisition is part of our strategy to enhance our product offering by both acquisition and our own R&D," said Oozi Cats, Telit's chief executive.
