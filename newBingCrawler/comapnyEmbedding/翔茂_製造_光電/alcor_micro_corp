The AU6998AN (embedded Crystal) USB 2.0 Flash Disk Controller is the best high performance solutions for SLC, MLC, TLC NAND, EF_Nand and DDR with multiple dies data flash. AU6998AN has 72bit/1K BCH ECC engines to correct high error bits of new generation flash and provide the well performance for DDR mode.AU6998AN provides dual channel access and ISP (In-System Programming) technologies, which are the most important features to allow manufacturers building high performance UFD easily and to have the flexibility of adopting different source of flash chips.To enhance the usefulness and manageability of UFD further, Alcor Micro develops a smart application program iStar (Partition/Password Operation Tool) as a handy utility in managing partition, password and security. Having iStar as the companion of UFD, the data in a UFD could be protected from unauthorized access successfully.
