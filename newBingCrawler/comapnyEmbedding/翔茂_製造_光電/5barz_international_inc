(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Plan of Operations  Business  5BARz International Inc. ("5BARz" or the "Company") is a leading wireless Company which has designed and patented a line of cellular network infrastructure devices for use in the office, home and mobile market places. The Companies products incorporate multiple patented technologies to create a highly engineered, single-piece, plug 'n play device that strengthens weak cellular signals to deliver high quality signals for voice, data and video reception on cell phones and other cellular equipped devices. The 5BARz(R) solution represents a critical solution for cellular network carriers in providing a clear, reliable, high quality signal for their subscribers with a growing need for high quality connectivity, especially as relates to the use of data on mobile devices. The Company's products are engineered to incorporate a great number of features more fully addressed herein.  The Company is in the process of developing the global commercialization of the cellular network product enhancements to facilitate the expansion through cellular network operators, with each sector of integration to be managed in geographic areas. The initial business focus is currently in India, with formative steps taken in Latin America, the U.S., Africa and Western European market sectors.  In recent months, the Company has diversified it's product offering, having developed a "Fuji WIFI Router" which is duly approved and certified by CE, and TEC certification in India. That product and those comprised in the "5BARz Broadband Experience Roadmap" are the basis of a recently announced Strategic Alliance Agreement, between 5BARz, and leading Companies in the region involved in the broadband and cellular network business. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, the Companies are committed to deploy not less than 5 Million units of the 5BARz product to subscribers in India over a period of 5 years commencing on the execution date of this agreement. The Strategic alliance also contemplates the delivery of other products and accessories, which may include connected sensors, connected home automation devices, connected cameras, headsets, VoIP phones etc.  We were incorporated in Nevada on November 17, 2008 and the Company has offices in the States of Nevada, California and Florida as well as subsidiary operations in Mexico and India. The address of the Company's Innovation Center in San Diego is 9444 Waples Street, Suite 140, San Diego, California, 92121, in Nevada at 9670 Gateway Drive, 2nd floor, Reno Nevada, 89521 and in Florida at 1111 Brickell Ave. 11thFloor, Miami, Florida, 33131. Our centralized telephone number is 877-723-7255. Our web site is www.5BARz.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably possible after they are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): our Annual Report on Form 10K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13 (a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information posted on our web site is not necessarily incorporated into this report.  During the recent quarter, the focus of the Company has been multi faceted;  In India, our subsidiary Company, working in conjunction with our team of contract engineers in India and the US, and have been active working with some of the largest cellular network operators in the region, delivering product in response to increasing volume purchase orders received from those cellular network operators. The Companies are focused upon the integration of those products into the cellular network operators portfolio of solutions for the improvement of their network. The near term objective is to expand the manufacturing capability of the Company and supply of products to those cellular network operators and integrate the 5BARz(R)products into their supply chain. Participating cellular network operators can expect vastly improved connectivity for their subscribers in the region. The more significant improvements that subscribers will experience are (i) significantly improved upload and download times for data transmission, (ii) clearer voice communication with fewer dropped calls (iii) a reduction in radio frequency emissions at the handset utilized by the subscriber and (iv) improved battery life on the handset, to mention a few.  During the recent quarter, the Company has manufactured and delivered product based upon initial purchase orders received from two of the largest cellular network operators in India for units that are specifically channelized for operation on each operator's network. The Company has received very positive feedback on the operation of these units in India. Testing has indicated data rate improvements up to 100%, elimination of dropped calls and an elimination of buffering for audio/video reception. Based upon these deliveries, in addition to several other purchase orders in increasing quantities, one cellular network operator has issued a "Network Hardware and Software Ordering Document", commencing June 1, 2016, and effective for two years, which provides the parameters for orders to be shipped to that operator, during that period.  The Companies involvement with these cellular network operators, and the 5BARz proven capability in the industry have resulted in the expansion of opportunities for the Company. The Company delivered a "Fuji WIFI Broadband Router" in response to an opportunity to participate in the rapid expansion of broadband to the home throughout India, As a result on August 25, 2016 the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with a Tier 1 cellular network operator in the region, along with a major broadband operator in the region to provide a minimum of 5 Million of the 5BARz broadband routers to clients of the Company's strategic partners.  The Company is continuing the process of expanding the features included, and improving the functionality of the cellular extenders, making the value proposition of the units vastly more significant than was originally envisioned. Having developed these products the Company is setting it's sights on several other geographic areas in which to integrate it's products.  It should be noted that the product designed for the market in India is designed in a configuration that is functional to provide services to 91 Countries globally, with an aggregate subscriber base of 2.98 billion subscribers comprising some of the most significant wireless markets in the world. Further sales orders are underway with a planned on-boarding of product to integrate the Companies products, into the supply chain of our customer. In addition, sales and marketing efforts with other cellular network operators in India are progressing with product deliveries expected to expand substantially in the balance of 2016.  In the US, the Companies innovation center in San Diego has been focused upon the logistics required to meet the needs of the marketplace in India as well as the transition of product manufacturing from the US to India for that marketplace. In addition, the Engineering teams in San Diego and India have continued the development of new product enhancements which will improve the products flexibility with respect to operational characteristics for various other global markets, including the US. Cellular networks throughout the world are comprised of variable configurations, using 2G, 3G and 4G LTE technologies, operating on variable bands and frequencies. New technology being integrated into the Companies products will serve to accelerate the Company's ability to customize product for specific market needs in various geographic areas and cellular network configurations. In addition, technological developments are being completed to enhance the "mobile" product first introduced in 2010 by the Company, improving the functional and simplicity of use of that product.  In Mexico, the inventory of Road Warriors have been presented to retail operators in the region and the Company has received expressions of interest from them to carry the product. However, that commitment is associated with a requirement for the funding of sales and marketing programs in the region by the Company, and the related working capital requirements for inventory. The Company has made the strategic decision to focus resources on the more significant activity in India at this time, and to commence the retail program in Mexico and Latin America, subsequent to the launch in India.  Strategy and focus areas  Our focus is on three foundational priorities;  � Leadership in our core business, maintaining the highest standards in developing highly engineered devices to manage connectivity in the vicinity of the user.  � Effective collaboration with cellular network operators to ensure that our products fully meet their needs in providing their subscriber base with a portfolio of state of the art solutions for maintaining excellence in connectivity.  � Architectural design creation, to facilitate the effective integration of the Companies product into new and innovative applications, to maintain operators control over that system and to expand product lines for use in automobiles, computers and numerous other areas of application.  The Company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of recent market transitions. As more and more users are migrating to the use of cellular equipped devices for communication, internet access, navigation and even entertainment, consumer demand for clear and consistent cellular signal has never been more important. In our opinion, this evolution driven by mobile device proliferation is in early stages. 5BARz is uniquely positioned to meet this growing demand with their developing line of product.  The Company's recently introduced, highly evolved innovative, carrier grade device, incorporates technologies and a combination of functionality which represents the most advanced product developed in this market, to date. This next generation cellular network extender, branded as 5BARz(R) incorporates patented technology to create a highly engineered, single-piece, plug 'n play unit that strengthens weak cellular signals to deliver higher quality signal for voice, data and video reception on cell phones, and other cellular equipped devices.  Products  The 5BARz Cellular Network Extender was unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, March 2014. Since that time the product has undergone significant product field testing in international locations and improvements, resulting in a product which is ready for deployment.  This product supports 2G & 3G technologies for cellular devices, and has been designed in configurations which operate on either a single frequency or multiple frequencies. The technology has successfully integrated both send and receive antennae into the single device, and hosts an abundance of features which have never before been integrated into a single portable cellular device.  The Company's initial product, the Road Warrior, won the prestigious 2010 innovation of the year award at CES (the largest consumer electronics show in the world) for achievements in product design and engineering. The Road Warrior, has passed FCC Certification, and has been produced in limited quantities to date by a contract manufacturer in the Philippines. 5BARz current technological developments have eclipsed the original Road Warriors produced.  Management at 5BARz are confident that this new cellular device will alleviate much of the frustration experienced by users globally, associated with weak or compromised cellular signal. This technology facilitates cellular usage in areas where structures, create "cellular shadows" or weak spots within metropolitan areas, and highly congested areas such as freeways, and also serves to amplify cellular signal as users move away from cellular towers in urban areas. The market potential of the technology is far reaching.  The market opportunity for the 5BARz(TM) technology represents nearly 7 billion cell phone subscribers worldwide serviced by 900 cellular network operators. These cellular network operators represent the Company's primary point of entry to the Global marketplace.  The 5BARz business opportunity to bring this state of the art technology to market represents a significant step forward in the deployment of micro-cell technology in the industry.  Company History & Corporate Development  5BARz was incorporated on November 17, 2008, is a Nevada Corporation and was a designated shell Company until 2010. In 2010 the Company acquired the "Master Global Marketing and Distribution Rights" for the marketing and distribution of 5BARz(TM) products throughout the world from CelLynx Inc., a California based Company. In addition to the acquisition of the marketing and distribution rights, the Company acquired a 60% interest in the underlying intellectual property comprising the 5BARz(TM) products, and holds a security interest over the balance of those assets.  On March 27, 2012, 5BARz acquired a 60% controlling interest in CelLynx Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary CelLynx Inc. Cellynx was the original developer of the core technology underlying the 5BARz business.  On January 12, 2015, 5BARz International, Inc. incorporated another subsidiary Company, 5BARz International, SA DE CV in Mexico. The Company is a 99% owned subsidiary of 5BARz International, Inc. with the remaining 1% owned by Daniel Bland, the CEO of 5BARz International, Inc. The Company has obtained the necessary product approvals for the sale of the 5BARz Road Warrior product in Mexico, and has imported a limited inventory of product for resale in the Country.  On January 12, 2015, 5BARz India Private Limited was incorporated in India, a 99.9% subsidiary of 5BARz International, Inc. During the quarter under review, the Company shipped orders to two, Tier one cellular network operators in the region, and are organizing for a ramp up of production and sales volumes.  On May 26, 2016, the Company incorporated a subsidiary 5BARz PTE. Ltd. in Singapore, which is wholly owned by 5BARz International Inc.  During 2012 and 2013, the Company presented the first version of our product, the "Road Warrior" to Cellular Network operators in order to establish market recognition and interest in the product globally. Having established expressions of interest in the product, in June 2013 the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with a leading cellular network operator. Through that arrangement, we established a product development program to deliver a product, designed with our partners input that meets their requirements, in order to integrate the product into their portfolio of solutions for network improvement.  In November 2013, 5BARz set up an Innovation Center in San Diego California, staffed by a talented engineering team and in addition established significant outsourced engineering and fabrication talent internationally. As a result, a state of the art product was developed working with our collaborative partners. The Company is very pleased with the quality of product provided with feature sets that meet and exceed those originally envisioned in our collaboration plan. The Company is equally pleased with the future development programs being developed, which significantly expands the horizons of the Company's product line and our value proposition to the wireless industry.  As the Company's newest products commence limited production, for distribution and testing by potential partners in locations around the world, our focus moves to the development of high volume manufacturing to meet global demand. Our manufacturing partner Flextronics represents an industry leader in the design, manufacturing, distribution and aftermarket support of electronic products. Flextronics operates through a network of facilities in more than 30 countries with a global workforce of 200,000.

The Market Opportunity  The market opportunity for the 5BARz(TM) technology represents nearly 7 billion cell phone subscribers worldwide and is growing as a result of the following factors;  � Dead zones, weak signals, and dropped calls are the biggest problems in the industry. Now, by adding internet and video, the quality issue is increasing exponentially.  � 76% of cellular subscribers use their mobile phone as the primary phone  � More consumers are using mobile phones for web browsing, up and down- loading photos, videos and music  � More mobile phones are operating at higher frequencies which have less ability to penetrate buildings  � Weak signals make internet applications inaccessible and slow and increase the drain on cell phone batteries.  � Forty percent of all mobile phone users report inadequate service in their homes or office and we estimate that 60% of the 6.8 billion mobile phone users worldwide consider continuous connectivity to be very important.  Consumer demand for quality in the cell phone user experience is becoming an increasingly important factor. The 5BARz(TM) technology meets this need. 5BARz is currently developing relationships with Cellular network operators internationally to integrate the 5BARz(TM) product into cellular networks globally.  The recently developed expansion of product by introduction of the 5BARz WIFI Router has facilitated the Company's participation into a rapidly growing opportunity for broadband connectivity in the home in India. Currently 30% of homes in the region have Broadband connectivity. That percentage is expected to expand considerably in the region for a few reasons. First, the cost of connectivity is decreasing and in addition new apps exist which facilitate voice recognition and translation of commands. Any person in any language can now access the worldwide web. The opportunity, envisions the expansion of services beyond router connectivity. The 5BARz roadmap envisions expansion of product into the internet of things technologies and big data management services and sales.  Why Poor Signals Exist  A variety of factors may cause dropped calls and dead zones, including congestion, radio signal interference, tower hand-off, and lack of coverage. Despite continued infrastructure investment by operators, and antenna technology improvements by base station providers and mobile phone makers, these problems will continue for the foreseeable future. This is because many of the contributing factors can't be controlled by the operators and manufacturers. To understand how innovative 5BARz(R) products are in improving phone signals, it's first important to understand the causes of poor signal quality.  Congestion  In 1999, sales of mobile phones surpassed combined sales of personal computers and automobiles. By 2010, mobile phones had replaced land-line phones in 30% of U.S. households. Smart phones, led by iPhones and Android phones, have become indispensible personal assistants. Laptop computer sales outnumber desktop computer sales, and most laptops are equipped with cellular data chipsets or USB modems. Apple's iPad has sparked the connected tablet market too. Vending machines, automobiles, mobile sensors, and many other devices include "machine to machine" cellular data modules. As a result, the number of cellular voice and data devices will soon exceed the number of people on Earth.  If sheer numbers weren't enough, new uses for mobile devices are causing even faster growth in bandwidth usage. Obvious uses include video entertainment, videoconferencing, downloaded and streaming music, MMS, email, and application downloads. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and many other social networking applications put further load on operator networks. Also, surprising sources of traffic have emerged, such as deliberate "miscalls". A miscall is when one subscriber calls another, but hangs up before the receiving party answers. Since operators don't charge for these uncompleted calls, subscribers are using miscalls as a free way to communicate. In India, orders for milk are made this way. In Syria, five miscalls in a row signals the recipient to "go online" to the Internet and chat. In Bangladesh, it's estimated that up to 70% of traffic at peak times is due to miscalls. This practice isn't limited to countries with low per-capita income, and yet it places a high load on operator networks.  There are sources of congestion based on location and time, too. Transportation clusters like airports, major highway intersections, bridges, and toll road gates all bring many people together at peak times. Also, because of home land-line replacement, many residential neighborhoods have many mobile phones in simultaneous use in mornings and evenings. Lastly, local population growth and immigration can result in too many phones for existing infrastructure. Due to long planning times, investment requirements, local government permits, and construction time, it's difficult for infrastructure to keep up with the pace of change in many developing areas, especially in growth countries.  Radio Signal Interference  Interference comes from both obvious and subtle causes. Certain materials aren't transparent to radio signals, especially durable materials used in buildings, large structures, and even automobiles. As a result there are radio shadows in which a mobile phone can't sense the signal from a base station. In addition, . . .  Oct 28, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

  5BARz International, Inc. (BARZ) is engaged in the design, development and global commercialization of new technologies that enable cellular network carriers to improve the connectivity performance endemic on their networks and provide clear, high-quality signal for their subscribers. By addressing the global demand for high-quality service, 5BARz seeks to capitalize on the minimum market opportunity of approximately $27 billion. At the core of this mission is the company’s patented product technology, 5BARz™, a cellular network infrastructure device for use in the small office, home or for when users are mobile. 5BARz has incorporated this patented technology to create a highly engineered, single-piece, plug 'n play unit that strengthens weak cellular signals and delivers high-quality signals for voice, data and video reception on cell phones and other cellular-equipped devices. Current cellular network infrastructure is comprised of cell towers, cellular base stations, macro repeaters, micro cells, and many other “carrier grade” technologies and categories. 5BARz aims to revolutionize this network infrastructure with its one-of-a-kind and industry first 5BARz Network Extender™ product. This entirely new category will allow network operators the ability to position or “extend” a new and critical piece of their network infrastructure directly into the homes and offices of its subscribers to deliver a stronger, more reliable cellular signal. 5BARz Network Extender was launched in February, 2014, in Barcelona during the Mobile World Congress, and garnered widespread and extremely positive feedback that confirmed the company’s belief that the industry is looking for a solution to improve coverage in poor coverage areas within their networks. 5BARz™ represents a critical solution with the potential to fundamentally change the way cellular carrier network infrastructure is designed and deployed to their billions of subscribers worldwide.       Investment Highlights  Pioneer in Wireless Infrastructure Technology 	Strong U.S., Mexico Distribution Strategy 	Guided by Accomplished Management Team 	Innovative and Affordable Wireless Solutions 	Clear, Well-Planned Development Roadmap 	Competing in $52B Wireless Network Market 	Makers of Award-Winning Road Warrior     Technology & Patents  As an industry pioneer in wireless infrastructure technology, 5BARz intends to expand its current portfolio of two patents issued, 11 international patent applications in process, and four original U.S. applications in process. Patents Issued  The Cell Phone Booster patent covers a RF signal booster that incorporates active stability control, minimizing emissions and network interference while maximizing booster performance. 	The Multiband Wireless Repeater covers wireless repeaters utilizing antennae having high electrical isolation and delivers superior performance in the smallest, most compact package possible.  These patents serve as the core of 5BARz’s innovative products and services. The 5BARz Extender The 5BARz Network Extender™ will allow network operators from all over the world to position or “extend” a new and critical piece of their network infrastructure directly into the homes and offices of its subscribers, not unlike cable providers do with their cable boxes and ISP’s do with their modems. This device will allow for carriers to finally deliver a stronger, more reliable cellular single hence easing the frustrations of mobile subscribers all over the globe. The 5BARz Network Extender™ is a “carrier grade” cellular network infrastructure device which is capable of being remotely managed from each carrier’s Network Operation Center and includes patented technologies such as bringing together both the send and receive antenna into a single form factor, automatically cancels echo or “noise cancellation,” supports multiple bands and all frequencies around the world, and automatically balances power management to avoid any interference with the macro network with the ability to support up to 10 simultaneous users at a time.  Consumer Centric Design 	Plug n’ Play Ease 	Integrated Antenna 	Patent Issued 	Echo Cancellation 	Patent Issued  Road Warrior Developed by 5BARz subsidiary CelLynx Group, the Road Warrior plug-n-play device delivers full cell phone signal strength and up to 20x faster Internet in "dead" zones. The device can be used from any location where power is available, including vehicles, homes, offices or hotel rooms and without the need for installation, external cabling or antennas. The 5BARz Road Warrior won the prestigious Innovation of the Year award at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show for achievements in product design and engineering, and 5BARz is currently redesigning the device for an enhanced version expected to launch in Q1 2015.  Supports voice and data 	Supports 3G 	Cellular and PCS bands 	No backhaul required 	Best in class power management     Competitive Edge  5BARz plans to sell its products through mobile network carriers. To foster customer loyalty, each carrier network will have its own proprietary version of the system.  5BARz’s innovative and affordable solutions improve mobile phone and wireless data signals for phones, laptops, and tablets. The company’s products meet incredible industry demand, improving reception, reducing dropped calls and eliminating dead zones, preventing degradation of wireless data rates and maintaining data reliability. Through successful capital raises in the past 12 months, 5BARz has raised more than $3 million, allowing the acceleration and completion of 5BARz Network Extender. Last year’s FCC ruling underscored the need for signal “boosters” that do not adversely affect wireless network, providing 5BARz with a significant and sustainable competitive advantage. 5BARz’s patented technology incorporates all of the “Network Protection Standard Requirements” set out in the FCC findings while making the product both user and operator friendly. Additional Advantages:   Plug-n-play design eliminates means no installation required 	No external antenna and cabling required 	Works with cellphones, smart phones and laptops 	Highly reliable and affordable 	Stronger signals and better reception 	Compact size 	Fully compliant with 2G, 3G, and 4G or LTE 	Great for homes, hotels and offices whose building structures cause cell interference 	Ideal for car travel in areas prone to spotty service 	Doubles distance of useable connectivity when offshore boating and beneficial to many other outdoor activities in remote areas     Market Opportunity   Readily available cellular industry data clearly shows that more than 3% of the world’s 4.3 billion mobile subscribers leave one network for a competing network specifically because of poor single quality, dropped calls and terribly weak data throughput (in industry parlance, “churn”), all at a time when cellular devices are becoming increasingly data reliant. For 5BARz to simply address the “churn” issue, the market opportunity is at minimum approximately $27 billion. However, the company sees market potential well above the churn. Why? In the highly competitive cellular market, customer loyalty is driven by carriers that go that extra step in proving that they clearly understand how and for what purposes mobile subscribers currently use their mobile devices. The data is clear on this.  Voice revenues for carriers globally are rapidly falling while data revenues continue to climb despite the subpar data capabilities that mobile subscribers endure on a daily basis. Carrier networks simply are not yet adequately developed to capture the rapidly increasing demand for much increased data usage on mobile phones. Those infamous “drop spots,” whether in the interior of a building or on the highway, are not areas that are being ignored by network carriers; rather, the network carriers simply lack the final, critical piece of their network infrastructure. Given this conundrum, 5BARz aims to change the way the carriers build, roll-out and deploy their network infrastructure with the 5BARz Network Extender. The 5BARz Network Extender is the last piece of equipment that carriers need to be able to deliver optimum performance over their networks and finally put to rest years of subscriber frustration. The 5BARz Network Extender truly delivers the “last mile in mobile connectivity.”    Growth Strategy   5BARz has made great strides in advancing to its growth strategy, backed by the help and expertise of a dedicated team of employees, advisors and support from its stakeholders. The company began distribution of products with an initial delivery of devices to Mexico, Latin America’s second largest market. The strategic decision to commence distribution in this market through Computación AM, which boasts a client network of more than 20,000, positions 5BARz for strong growth in 2014 and beyond. 5BARz also opened a new Southern California Innovation Center in October, providing design and engineering capabilities to further develop 5BARz’s core technologies and to meet the product delivery needs of its partners. Near-Term Growth Drivers The company’s product development roadmap envisions the core technology to be adapted to several different market segments in the near future, including continuing to reduce the size of its devices. Furthermore, 5BARz is in the process of redesigning its mobile solution sand believes the new designs will be more suitable for incorporation by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). The integration of this technology into products such as automobiles, recreational vehicles, and computers would represent a major leap forward in cellular network performance and improve customer satisfaction and usage.    Leadership   Most successful business people around the world will point to the “team” as the single most important factor in a company’s DNA. With the right people, we have all watched small companies emerge and in a short period of time change the world. The difference maker each and every time is the TEAM.   Daniel Bland - Founder / Chief Executive Officer  5BARz founder and CEO Daniel Bland is a seasoned entrepreneur who has firmly established himself as a ‘hands-on’ developer of premier and unique technologies.

5 Tips On Avoiding Reception Rage.
Keep your hands on the device
Avoid losing physical control. Avoid throwing or destroying the device. Take a deep breath, count to 10.
Know that you’re not alone
From time to time, we all lack signal — everyone has some form of reception rage. Try and commiserate with the strangers around you, because you can’t reach your friends.
Avoid signal limiting areas
Plan ahead. Dense urban areas, houses and buildings, large venues and remote locales are prime locations for a weak or unreliable signal.
Lower your expectations
Take a step back. Keep your texts concise and calls short - forget about attaching pictures, limit message to letters and numbers.
End the problem for good
Demand 5Barz. Stream video. Tag friends. Speak loud and clear.
