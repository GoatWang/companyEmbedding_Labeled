Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
Tae Jong Lee was an officer during our Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings in 2009. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Companys executive officers and directors, and persons who own more
than 10% of a registered class of its equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all
Section 16(a) forms they file. 
  3 



Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company, the Company
believes that during 2016 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders were in compliance with Section 16(a), except that late Form 4 filings were filed on March 16,
2016 on behalf of Gary Tanner, Ilbok Lee, Nader Tavakoli, R. Douglas Norby (who was then serving as a director of the Company), Michael Elkins (who was then serving as a director of the Company), YJ Kim, J. Kim, T. Kim, Tae Jong Lee and Woung Moo
Lee relating to a grant of restricted stock units and stock options made to each such director or officer on March 11, 2016.  Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics  We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees.
Wewill provide a copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics without charge to any person upon written request made to our Secretary at MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Inc., 60 South Market Street, Suite 750,
San Jose, CA 95113. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is also available on our website at www.magnachip.com. We will disclose any waivers or amendments to the provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our website. 
Assessment of Risk  Our Board believes that our
compensation programs are designed such that they will not incentivize unnecessary risk-taking. The base salary component of our compensation program is a fixed amount and does not depend on performance. Payout levels under our cash incentive
program are capped and payout opportunities may be achieved on a straight-line interpolation basis between threshold and target levels, and between the target and maximum levels. In addition, non-GAAP
performance metrics are used in our cash incentive program to align achievement with our business strategy. Our equity awards are limited by the terms of our equity plans to a fixed maximum amount specified in the plan, and are subject to vesting to
align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our equityholders.  Committees 
The Board of Directors has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee and the Risk Committee. The Board of Directors establishes ad hoc committees from time to time, which currently include the Finance Committee, the Strategic Review Committee and the Advisory Committee. 
The Board of Directors has adopted written charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and the Risk Committee. These charters, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are posted and available on our website at www.magnachip.com. The information on or accessible
through our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Report.  Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee consists of Mr. Keating, as Chair, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli. Our Board of Directors has determined that
Mr. Keating is an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act. Our Board of Directors has also determined that each of
Mr. Keating, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli is independent as that term is defined in Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards and Rule 10A-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.  The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee
charter is posted and available on our website at www.magnachip.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Report. 
Compensation Committee  Our Compensation
Committee consists of Mr. Martino, as Chair, Dr. Lee, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Martino, Dr. Lee, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli is independent under
applicable NYSE listing standards.  The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating and approving our executive
officer and director compensation plans, policies and programs, as well as all equity-based compensation plans and policies. 
  4 



Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Dr. Lee, as Chair, Mr. Martino and Mr. Tanner. Our Board of
Directors has determined that each of Dr. Lee, Mr. Martino and Mr. Tanner is independent under applicable NYSE listing standards. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to become board members, recommends director nominees,
recommends board members for committee membership, develops and recommends corporate governance principles and practices, oversees the evaluation of our Board of Directors and its committees and formulates a description of the skills and attributes
of desirable board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider candidates recommended by our stockholders so long as the proper procedures are followed. 
Risk Committee  Our Risk Committee
consists of Mr. Tavakoli, as Chair, Mr. Klein and Dr. Lee. The Risk Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Companys management of key risks, as well as the guidelines, policies and processes for
monitoring and mitigating such risks. The Risk Committees primary responsibility is to oversee and approve the implementation of Company-wide risk and crisis management best practices. Other responsibilities of the Risk Committee include
providing input to management in identifying, assessing, mitigating and monitoring enterprise-wide risks the Company faces and reviewing the Companys business practices, compliance activities and enterprise risk management and making
recommendations to the Board of Directors related to such review.  Board Leadership Structure 
Separation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the Board of Directors shall elect its Chairman and appoint the Companys Chief Executive
Officer according to its view of what is best for the Company at any given time. The Board of Directors does not believe there should be a fixed rule as to whether the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be vested in the same
person or two different people, or whether the Chairman should be an employee of the Company or should be elected from among the non-employee directors. The needs of the Company and the individuals available
to play these roles may dictate different outcomes at different times, and the Board of Directors believes that retaining flexibility in these decisions is in the best interest of the Company. 
Currently, Mr. Tanner serves as the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mr. YJ Kim serves as the Companys
Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors may, however, make changes to its leadership structure in the future as it deems appropriate.  Lead
Director  In the event that positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person, on an annual basis the
independent members of the Board of Directors will select a lead director from the independent directors then serving on the Board of Directors (the Lead Director). The length of service as Lead Director is subject to the Board of
Directorss discretion, but will be a minimum of one year. The Lead Director has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors. 
Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors 
The Companys non-management directors meet at regularly scheduled Board of Directors meetings in
executive session without management present. In 2016, the Chairman presided over the meetings of the non-management directors. In addition, in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the
independent members of the Board of Directors meet at least twice a year in executive session, with the Chairman setting the agenda and presiding over such meetings. 
Presiding Director  In accordance with
our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the presiding director of the Board of Directors is the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if present, or in such persons absence and if applicable, the Lead Director, or in such persons absence, the
Audit Committee Chairman, or in such persons absence, the independent director present who has the most seniority on the Board of Directors. The presiding director presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors and is responsible for
chairing the Board of Directors executive sessions.

Item 11. Executive Compensation 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Compensation
Philosophy and Objectives  The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Committee) has overall
responsibility for administering our compensation program for our named executive officers. The Committees responsibilities consist of evaluating, approving and monitoring our executive officer and director compensation plans,
policies and programs, as well as each of our equity-based compensation plans and policies. For 2016, our named executive officers were:   


 

 
Young-Joon Kim, our Chief Executive Officer; 
 


 

 
Jonathan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; 
 


 

 
Theodore Kim, our Chief Compliance Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; 
 


 

 
Tae Jong Lee, our Executive Vice President and General Manager, Foundry Services Group; and 
 


 

 
Woung Moo Lee, our Executive Vice President and General Manager, Standard Products Group. 
The
Committee seeks to establish total compensation for executive officers that is fair, reasonable and competitive. The Committee evaluates our compensation packages to ensure that: 
 


 

 
we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior executives in critical positions; 
 


 

 
our executives are incentivized and rewarded for corporate growth, achievement of long-term corporate objectives and individual performance that meets or exceeds our expectations without encouraging unnecessary
risk-taking; and 
 


 

 
compensation provided to critical executives remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of companies in the semiconductor industry. 
The Committee believes that the most effective executive compensation packages align executives interests with those of our stockholders
by rewarding performance that exceeds specific annual, long-term and strategic goals that are intended to improve stockholder value. These objectives include the achievement of financial performance goals and progress on projects that our Board of
Directors anticipates will lead to future growth, as discussed more fully below.  The information set forth below in this Compensation
Discussion and Analysis describes the Committees general philosophy and historical approach.  Say on Pay Vote and Stockholder Input
 The Committee also seeks to ensure that the compensation paid to the Companys executive officers is aligned with the
interests of the Companys stockholders. In that respect, as part of its ongoing review of the compensation paid to the Companys executive officers, the Committee considered the approval by approximately 96.8% of the votes cast for the
Say on Pay vote relating to the compensation of our named executive officers at the Companys 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and determined that the Companys executive compensation philosophy, compensation objectives, and
compensation elements continued to be appropriate and did not make any changes to the Companys executive pay program for 2016.  Timing of
Compensation Decisions  At the end of each fiscal year, our chief executive officer reviews the performance of the other executive
officers and presents his conclusions and recommendations to the Committee. At that time and throughout the year, the Committee also evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer, which is measured in substantial part against our
consolidated financial performance. In the first quarter of 2016, the Committee then assessed the overall functioning of our compensation plans against our goals, and determined whether any changes to the allocation of compensation elements, or the
structure or level of any particular compensation element, were warranted.  In connection with this process, our Committee generally
establishes the elements of our short-term cash incentive plan for the upcoming year. With respect to newly hired employees, our practice is typically to approve equity grants at the first meeting of the Committee following such employees hire
date. We do not have any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with the release of material non-public information. From time to time, additional equity awards may be granted to
executive officers during the fiscal year. 
  6 



Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions 
For named executive officers other than our chief executive officer, we have historically sought and considered input from our chief executive
officer in making determinations regarding executive compensation. Our chief executive officer annually reviews the performance of our other named executive officers. Our chief executive officer subsequently presents conclusions and recommendations
regarding the compensation of such officers, including proposed salary adjustments and incentive amounts, to the Committee. The Committee then takes this information into account when it makes final decisions regarding any adjustments or awards.
 The review of performance by the Committee and our chief executive officer of other executive officers is both an objective and
subjective assessment of each executives contribution to our performance, leadership qualities, strengths and weaknesses and performance relative to goals set by the Committee or our chief executive officer, as applicable. The Committee and
our chief executive officer do not systematically assign a weight to the factors, and may, in their discretion, consider or disregard any one factor which, in their sole discretion, is important to or irrelevant for a particular executive. 
The Committees annual determinations regarding executive compensation are subject to the terms of the respective service agreements
between us and the named executive officers (as set forth in more detail below). In addition to the annual reviews, the Committee also typically considers compensation changes upon a named executive officers promotion or other change in job
responsibility. Neither our chief executive officer nor any of our other executives participate in deliberations relating to their own compensation. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Committee engages an external compensation consultant to assist it by providing information, analysis and other advice relating to our
executive compensation program and the decisions resulting from its annual executive compensation review. For 2016, the Committee retained Compensia Inc. (Compensia), a national compensation consulting firm, to serve as its compensation
consultant. This compensation consultant serves at the discretion of the Committee.  During 2016, Compensia provided the following
services:   


 

 
assisted the Committee in determining the design and amount of equity awards for the key executives and Board members; and 
 


 

 
assisted the Committee in determining the appropriate pool of stock to grant to all employees in 2016. 
In 2016, Compensia did not provide any services to us other than the consulting services to the Committee. The Committee regularly reviews the
objectivity and independence of the advice provided by its compensation consultant on executive compensation. In 2016, the Committee considered the six specific independence factors adopted by the SEC and reflected in the NYSE listing standards and
determined that the work performed by Compensia did not raise any conflicts of interest.  Elements of Compensation 
In making decisions regarding the pay of the named executive officers, the Committee looks to set a total compensation package for each officer
that will retain high-quality talent and motivate the officer to achieve the goals set by our Board of Directors. Our 2016 compensation package was comprised of the following elements: 
 


 

 
annual base salary; 
 


 

 
short-term cash incentives; 
 


 

 
long-term equity incentives; 
 


 

 
a health and welfare benefits package that is generally available to all of our employees; 
 


 

 
expatriate and other executive benefits; and 
 


 

 
limited post-employment or change in control benefits pursuant to individual severance agreements. 
Determination of Amount of Each Element of Compensation 
General Background  The Committee seeks to
establish a total cash compensation package for our named executive officers that is competitive with the compensation for similarly situated executives in our compensation peer group, subject to adjustments based on each executives experience
and performance. Historically, based on our review of industry-specific survey data and the professional and market experience of our Committee members, we measured total cash compensation for our 
  7 




named executive officers against cash compensation paid to executives at similarly situated companies which we determined to be in our select peer group. Base salaries for our named executive
officers would then be set at competitive levels as compared to similarly situated executives in the select peer group. Short-term cash incentives would be put in place to provide for opportunities that may result in competitive levels of cash
compensation as compared to our select peer group if, and depending upon the extent to which, our performance and that of our named executive officers exceeded expectations and the goals established by the Committee for the applicable year. 
Competitive Positioning  For
purposes of comparing our executive compensation against the competitive market, the Committee reviews and considers the compensation levels and practices of a group of comparable technology companies. The companies in this compensation peer group
were selected on the basis of their similarity to us in size, industry focus and geographic location.  In October 2014, with the
assistance of Compensia, the Committee developed our compensation peer group based on U.S.-based semiconductor companies. We focused on U.S.-based semiconductor companies because our highest ranking executives are U.S. expatriates who have
opportunities to work with U.S.-based semiconductor companies. The companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us, based on the following criteria: 
 


 

 
industrysemiconductors; 
 


 

 
similar revenue size~0.5x to ~2.0x our last four fiscal quarter revenue of approximately $856 million (approximately $428 million to approximately $1.7 billion); 
 


 

 
executive positions similar in breadth, complexity and/or scope of responsibility; and 
 


 

 
competitors for executive talent. 
The Committee approved the use of the market data from this
peer group for our December 2014 executive compensation market assessment, which was used for setting executive compensation in 2016:   






 Cirrus Logic Cypress Semiconductor
Diodes Fairchild Semiconductor
Integrated Device Tech International Rectifier
Intersil Microsemi
  
 OmniVision Technologies PMC-Sierra RF Micro Devices
Semtech Silicon Laboratories
Spansion SunEdison Semiconductor
TriQuint Semiconductor

The Committee used the market data from this peer group that was developed in 2014 as a reference point in its
2016 executive compensation decisions along with compensation data from the Radford Global Technology Survey as of July 2014 for companies with annual revenues between $500 million and $1 billion, with median revenues of $739 million.
 The Committee reviews our compensation peer group periodically prior to assessing executive compensation and makes adjustments to its
composition, taking into account changes in both our business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group. The Committee is currently reviewing and revising our peer group for 2017. 
The Committee historically makes annual determinations regarding cash incentive compensation based on our annual operating plan, which we
usually adopt in December preceding each fiscal year. The determination takes into account our expected performance in the coming fiscal year. The Committee makes all equity compensation decisions for our officers based on existing compensation
arrangements for other executives at our Company with the same level of responsibility and based on a review of our select peer group with a view to maintaining internal consistency and parity. 
Equity awards are not tied to base salary or cash incentive amounts and will constitute lesser or greater proportions of total compensation
depending on market practices and the Committees determination of target grant values. The Committee, relying on the professional and market experience of our Committee members, generally seeks to set equity awards at competitive levels based
on both U.S. and Korean market practices and taking into account our equity plan share pool and projected dilution of our shares outstanding. 
The Committee does not apply a formula or assign relative weight in making its determination. Instead, it makes a subjective determination
after considering all information collectively. 
  8 



The Committee may approve additional cash incentive payments or equity compensation grants
from time to time during the year in its discretion.  Annual Base Salary 
Base salary is the guaranteed element of an employees annual cash compensation. The Committee seeks to set the base salaries of our named
executive officers at competitive levels as compared to similarly situated executives in our select peer group, but also takes into account the named executive officers skill set and the value of that skill set. The Committee makes a
subjective decision regarding any changes in base salary based on these factors and the data from our select peer group. The Committee does not systematically assign weights to any of the factors it considers, and may, in its discretion, ignore any
factors or deem any one factor to have greater importance for a particular executive officer. Base salary adjustments generally take effect in the middle of our fiscal year. After considering the factors described above, in March 2016, the Committee
increased the annual base salary for Mr. TJ Lee and Mr. WM. Lee by 72,296,000 Korean won (or an annual base salary of $60,855 based on the monthly average exchange rate for March 2016) and 69,992,000 Korean won (or an annual base salary of
$58,916 based on the monthly average exchange rate for March 2016), respectively. The Committee did not make any other changes to the base salaries of our other named executive officers. 
Short-Term Cash Incentives  Short-term
cash incentives are typically designed as a percentage of base salary and may be awarded based on individual performance or our achievement of the annual, long-term and strategic quantitative goals set by the Committee. In December 2009, our Board
of Directors implemented a cash incentive plan effective as of January 1, 2010, which we call the Profit Sharing Plan. The Committee administers the Profit Sharing Plan. In 2016, we provided short-term cash incentive opportunities to our named
executive officers under our Profit Sharing Plan to encourage our named executive officers to achieve certain short-term corporate performance goals. For 2016, the Committee determined that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA would be the sole performance
goal under the Profit Sharing Plan, which the Committee believes is a key measure of our core operating performance. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is equal to our GAAP net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expenses (benefits),
depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude (i) restructuring, impairment and other (gain), (ii) equity-based compensation expense, (iii) foreign currency loss (gain), net, (iv) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, and
(v) restatement related expense. In June 2016, the Committee approved an annual Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA performance goal of $35 million based on the Companys annual operating plan for 2016 year. 
In June 2016, the Committee also approved the target bonus amounts for each named executive officer (the Target Bonus), as a
percentage of base salary, but with the related dollar amount of bonus awards prorated for the number of months remaining in the 2016 fiscal year, as set forth below.

Achievement of 115% of the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA performance goal resulted in a maximum payout of 150%
of the named executive officers Target Bonus, while achievement of 100% of the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA performance goal resulted a payout of 100% of such Target Bonus. Achievement below 85% of the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA performance
goal resulted in no bonus being earned. For performance within the maximum and threshold range, the percentage achievement would be determined based on a linear interpolation. 
In February 2017, the Committee determined that the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA goal was achieved at 115% of target. Although the level of
achievement resulted in the maximum payout of 150% of each named executive officers Target Bonus, management recommended to cap the payout at each individuals Target Bonus in light of our financial situation and the need to maintain
continued vigilance in managing expenses. After taking into account managements recommendation, the Committee determined to exercise negative discretion and approved the payments set forth below.

Long-Term Equity Incentives 
We offer long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards as a way to enhance the link between the creation of stockholder value
and executive incentive compensation and to give our named executive officers appropriate motivation and rewards for achieving increases in stockholder value. In 2016, the Committee granted a mix of stock options and time-based restricted stock
units (RSUs) to our named executive officers under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced our 2009 Common Unit Plan immediately following our corporate conversion. We believe that stock options, which we grant with exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, provide appropriate long-term incentive compensation for our named executive officers because they are rewarded only to the extent that our stock price appreciates
following the grant date of the stock options, which aligns with our stockholders interest in also seeing the value of their investment grow. We believe that time-based RSUs provide an appropriate balance to other forms of equity awards, help
us achieve our retention objectives and further align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders.  In
2016, the Committee granted stock options and RSUs to all of our named executive officers. In determining the value of each of these awards, the Committee considered competitive market data (based on the compensation peer group data), as well as its
objective of creating a meaningful retention incentive for each named executive officer and providing rewards for the named executive officers if they successfully achieve increases in stockholder value. Stock options and RSUs granted in 2016 vest
in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date.  Health and Welfare Benefits 
Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans which are generally provided for all full-time
employees, and on the same basis as all of our full-time employees in the country in which they are resident. These benefits include individual health insurance (medical, dental, and vision), group personal accident insurance and group business
travel insurance.  Perquisites and Other Benefits 
We provide the named executive officers with perquisites and other benefits, including expatriate benefits, that the Committee believes are
reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. Generally, perquisites are determined based upon what the Committee considers to be the most customary
perquisites offered by our select peer group and are not based upon a median cost for specific perquisites or for the perquisites in aggregate. The Committee determines the level and types of expatriate benefits for the executive officers based on
local market surveys taken by our human resources group. These surveys are not limited to our select peer group, but include a broad range of companies based outside of Korea but with significant operations in Korea. Attributed costs of the personal
benefits for the named executive officers are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below.  Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim and
Mr. T. Kim were expatriates during 2016, 2015 and 2014, and received expatriate benefits commensurate with market practice in Korea. These benefits, which were determined on an individual basis, included housing allowances, relocation and
repatriation allowances, insurance premiums, reimbursement for the use of a car, home leave flights, living expenses, childrens tuition allowances, tax equalization payments and tax advisory services, each as the Committee deemed appropriate
and in accordance with internal policies approved by our Board of Directors in effect from time to time.  Post-Employment Severance Benefits 
Each of our named executive officers is party to a severance agreement that provides certain payments upon his termination of employment and a
change in control of the Company. Please see the section below entitled Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control for further discussion of those benefits. 
In addition, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act, certain executive officers resident in Korea with one or more years of
service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason. For purposes of this section, we call this benefit statutory severance. The base statutory severance is approximately one month of base
salary per year of service. Each of our named executive officers accrued statutory severance in 2016.

Tax and Accounting Considerations 
The Committee considers the accounting impact of equity awards when designing compensation plans and arrangements for our executive officers
and other employees. Chief among these is Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (ASC 718), the standard which governs the accounting treatment of stock-based compensation awards. However,
accounting cost is just one factor considered when designing such compensation plans and arrangements for our executive officers and other employees.

MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC 2009 Common Unit Plan 
Following our emergence from our reorganization proceedings, in December 2009, our Board of Directors adopted, and our equityholders approved,
the MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC 2009 Common Unit Plan, which we refer to as the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provided for the grant of nonstatutory options, restricted unit bonus and purchase right awards, and deferred unit awards to employees and
consultants of our Company and our subsidiaries and to members of our Board of Directors. However, only options and restricted unit bonus awards were granted under the 2009 Plan. 
In connection with our corporate conversion at the time of our initial public offering in March 2011, MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation
assumed the rights and obligations of MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC under the 2009 Plan and converted MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC common unit options and restricted common units outstanding under the 2009 Plan into options to acquire a number of
shares of our common stock and shares of restricted common stock at a ratio of eight-for-one on substantially equivalent terms and conditions. As of December 31,
2016, there were outstanding under the 2009 Plan options to purchase 524,399 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $6.44 per share. The 2009 Plan terminated immediately following our corporate conversion, and no additional
options or other equity awards may be granted under the 2009 Plan. However, options granted under the 2009 Plan prior to its termination will remain outstanding until they are either exercised or expire. 
The 2009 Plan is administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2009 Plan, the Committee determined in its discretion the
persons to whom and the times at which awards were granted, the sizes of such awards, and all of their terms and conditions. All awards were evidenced by a written agreement between us and the holder of the award. The Committee has the authority to
construe and interpret the terms of the 2009 Plan and awards granted under it.  In the event of a change in control of our Company, the
vesting of all outstanding awards held by participants whose employment has not previously terminated will accelerate in full. In addition, the Committee has the authority to require that outstanding awards be assumed or replaced with substantially
equivalent awards by a successor corporation or to cancel the outstanding awards in exchange for a payment in cash or other property equal to the fair market value of restricted units or the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the units
subject to an option over the exercise price per unit of such option.  2011 Equity Incentive Plan 
Our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors and our stockholders in March 2010. We amended and
restated the 2011 Plan in February 2011, and our stockholders approved the amendment in March 2011 to reflect that it became effective in 2011 upon our corporate conversion. 891,703 shares of our common stock, or the total number of shares of common
stock (as adjusted by the conversion ratio in the corporate conversion) that remained available for grant upon the termination of the 2009 Plan immediately following the corporate conversion, were initially authorized and reserved. 
As of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding under the 2011 Plan (a) restricted stock units with respect to 518,480 shares of
common stock and (b) stock options to purchase 2,904,266 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $9.74 per share. As of December 31, 2016, 556,949 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the
2011 Plan. This reserve automatically increased on January 1, 2015, January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017 by an additional 681,129, 691,378 and 700,840 shares, respectively, and will automatically increase each subsequent anniversary
through 2021, by an amount equal to the smaller of 2% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or an amount determined by our Board of Directors. The number of shares authorized for
issuance under the 2011 Plan will also be increased from time to time by up to that number of shares of common stock remaining subject to options and restricted stock awards outstanding under the 2009 Plan at the time of its termination immediately
following the corporate conversion that expire or terminate or are forfeited for any reason after the effective date of the 2011 Plan, subject to a cap of 1,412,352 shares. Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and
other numerical limits in the 2011 Plan and in outstanding awards to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to awards granted under our 2011
Plan which expire, are repurchased, or are cancelled or forfeited will again become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. The shares available will not be reduced by awards settled in cash. Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations will not again become available for grant. The gross number of shares issued upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights or options exercised by means of a net exercise or by tender of previously owned shares will be deducted from the
shares available under the 2011 Plan. 
  14 



Awards may be granted under the 2011 Plan to our employees, including officers, directors,
or consultants or those of any present or future parent or subsidiary corporation or other affiliated entity. While we may grant incentive stock options only to employees, we may grant nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock purchase rights or bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and cash-based awards or other stock-based awards to any eligible participant. 
The 2011 Plan is administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2011 Plan, the Committee determines in its discretion the
persons to whom and the times at which awards are granted, the sizes of such awards, and all of their terms and conditions. All awards are evidenced by a written agreement between us and the holder of the award. The Committee has the authority to
construe and interpret the terms of the 2011 Plan and awards granted under it.  In the event of a change in control as described in the
2011 Plan, the acquiring or successor entity may assume or continue all or any awards outstanding under the 2011 Plan or substitute substantially equivalent awards. Any awards which are not assumed or continued in connection with a change in control
or are not exercised or settled prior to the change in control will terminate effective as of the time of the change in control. The Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting of any or all outstanding awards upon such terms and to such
extent as it determines, except that the vesting of all awards held by members of our Board of Directors who are not employees will automatically be accelerated in full. The 2011 Plan also authorizes the Committee, in its discretion and without the
consent of any participant, to cancel each or any outstanding award denominated in shares upon a change in control in exchange for a payment to the participant with respect to each share subject to the cancelled award of an amount equal to the
excess of the consideration to be paid per share of common stock in the change in control transaction over the exercise price per share, if any, under the award. 
In 2016, the Board delegated to a special equity committee composed of our chief executive officer the authority to grant and administer RSU
awards covering a total of 311,330 shares to approximately 1,100 nonunion employees of the Company (other than executive officers), with a maximum grant size of 1,000 shares per employee. Such RSUs vested on April 1, 2017. 
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
Our 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Purchase Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors in March 2010. Our Board of Directors
amended and restated the Purchase Plan in February 2011 to reflect that the Purchase Plan would become effective in 2011 upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. The Purchase Plan was approved by our stockholders in March 2011 and became
effective upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. We initially authorized and reserved 789,890 shares for sale under the Purchase Plan. In August 2012, the Committee suspended the Purchase Plan. 
As of December 31, 2016, 1,163,880 shares of our common stock remained reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. In addition, the
Purchase Plan provides for an automatic annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan on January 1 of each year beginning in 2012 and continuing through and including January 1, 2021 equal to the lesser of
(i) 1% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, (ii) 789,980 shares, or (iii) a number of shares as our Board of Directors may determine. Appropriate adjustments will be
made in the number of authorized shares and in outstanding purchase rights to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to purchase rights
which expire or are canceled will again become available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Because the Purchase Plan was suspended in August 2012, no annual increase in the number of shares authorized under such plan occurred on January 1,
2013 or in subsequent years.  Our employees and employees of any parent or subsidiary corporation designated by the Committee are eligible
to participate in the Purchase Plan if they are customarily employed by us for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted a right to purchase stock under the Purchase Plan if:
(i) the employee immediately after such grant would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock or of any parent or subsidiary corporation, or (ii) the employees
rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in value for each calendar year of participation in such plans. 
The Purchase Plan is implemented through a series of sequential offering periods, generally three months in duration beginning on the first
trading days of February, May, August, and November each year. The Committee is authorized to establish additional or alternative concurrent, sequential or overlapping offering periods and offering periods having a different duration or different
starting or ending dates, provided that no offering period may have a duration exceeding 27 months.  Amounts accumulated for each
participant, generally through payroll deductions, are credited toward the purchase of shares of our common stock at the end of each offering period at a price generally equal to 95% of the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date.
Prior to commencement of an offering period, the Committee is authorized to change the purchase price discount for that offering period, but the purchase price may not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the
beginning of the offering period or on the purchase date. 
  15 



No participant may purchase under the Purchase Plan in any calendar year shares having a
value of more than $25,000 measured by the fair market value per share of our common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period. Prior to the beginning of any offering period, the Committee may alter the maximum number of shares that
may be purchased by any participant during the offering period or specify a maximum aggregate number of shares that may be purchased by all participants in the offering period. If insufficient shares remain available under the plan to permit all
participants to purchase the number of shares to which they would otherwise be entitled, the Committee will make a pro rata allocation of the available shares. Any amounts withheld from participants compensation in excess of the amounts used
to purchase shares will be refunded, without interest.  In the event of a change in control, an acquiring or successor corporation may
assume our rights and obligations under the Purchase Plan. If the acquiring or successor corporation does not assume such rights and obligations, then the purchase date of the offering periods then in progress will be accelerated to a date prior to
the change in control as specified by the Committee, but the number of shares subject to outstanding purchase rights shall not be adjusted.

Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
We are obligated to make certain payments to our named executive officers upon termination or a change in control as further described below.

Young-Joon Kim. We entered into an Offer Letter with Mr. YJ Kim, dated as of April 15, 2013 and as amended on
July 27, 2015, pursuant to which Mr. YJ Kim is entitled to an initial annual base salary of $350,000 per year (subject to adjustment by our Board of Directors), a one-time signing bonus and
relocation allowance of $100,000, and an initial annual incentive bonus target of 80% (subject to adjustment by our Board of Directors) of his annual base salary based on company performance and attainment of management objectives under a plan
established and approved by the Board of Directors. Mr. YJ Kim is also entitled to customary employee benefits and expatriate benefits. Pursuant to his Offer Letter, on May 6, 2013, Mr. YJ Kim received an initial grant of an option to
purchase an aggregate of 200,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $15.96, which vests and becomes exercisable over three years from the date of commencement of Mr. YJ Kims employment with MagnaChip Korea.
We entered into a Severance Agreement with Mr. YJ Kim, dated as of November 3, 2015, which supersedes the severance provisions in Mr. YJ Kims Offer Letter. Under the Severance Agreement, if Mr. YJ Kims employment is
terminated by us without cause or by him with good reason, in addition to accrued but unpaid salary, vested non-severance benefits under other Company benefit plans and statutory severance under Korean law,
Mr. YJ Kim will be entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to two times his then current base salary, payable during the 12-month period following termination of employment, (ii) an amount equal to his then current base salary,
payable in a single cash lump sum following termination of employment, (iii) for 12 months following termination of employment, payment of any portion of health benefit premiums that are in excess of the amount he would have paid if he had
remained employed during such period, (iv) continued provision of expatriate benefits for 12 months following termination of employment, (v) continued reasonable use of our corporate club membership for 12 months following termination of
employment, (vi) a repatriation allowance and repatriation expenses in accordance with our expatriate benefit policy, and (vii) immediate vesting of all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options
and RSUs) upon termination of employment, with any stock options remaining outstanding and exercisable for two years following such termination (or the expiration of the option, if earlier). If such termination of employment by us without cause or
by Mr. YJ Kim with good reason occurs within three months prior to or 18 months following a change in control, in addition to the benefits described in the preceding sentence, Mr. YJ Kim will also be entitled to receive (i) an amount
equal to his then current base salary, payable in a single cash lump sum following termination of employment, and (ii) an additional 6 months of payments of health benefit premiums as described in part (iii) of the preceding sentence. The
Severance Agreement also provides that, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by Mr. YJ Kim will become immediately vested and, in the case
of options, exercisable, as of immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under the Severance Agreement is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65%
of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a change in control for purposes of the Severance Agreement but not the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. As a condition to the
receipt of payments and benefits under the Severance Agreement, Mr. YJ Kim must comply with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two-year post-termination non-competition covenant and
perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants.

(including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by Mr. J. Kim will become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under the
Severance Agreement is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. 
Termination. Our named executive officers are eligible to receive certain payments and benefits in connection with certain
service termination events pursuant to the terms of our Severance Agreements with them, as further described under the section entitled Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control. The terms
cause and good reason used below have the meanings given to them in the applicable agreements with us. 
Change in Control. The Committee has the authority to require that outstanding equity awards be assumed or replaced with
substantially equivalent awards by the successor corporation or to cancel the outstanding awards in exchange for a payment in cash or other property equal to the fair market value of restricted units or the excess, if any, of the fair market value
of the units subject to an option over the exercise price per unit of such option. For purposes of the foregoing, a change in control is generally defined as the acquisition by a person or entity of more than 51% of the combined voting
power of our then outstanding voting securities or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets to a person or entity that is not our affiliate. The Severance Agreements with our named executive officers each provides
that, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by such executive will become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of
immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under such Severance Agreements is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual
revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a change in control for purposes of such Severance Agreement but not the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. 
The following tables present our estimate of the dollar value of the payments and benefits payable to our named executive officers upon the
occurrence of certain terminations of their employment and upon a change in control, assuming that each such event occurred on December 31, 2016, and assuming a closing per share price of $6.20 on December 31, 2016. The disclosure in the
following table does not include:   


 

 
any accrued benefits that were earned and payable as of December 31, 2016; or 
 


 

 
payments and benefits to the extent they are provided generally to all salaried employees and do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of the named executive officers.

Pension Benefits for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 
In addition to the severance benefits described above, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act, certain executive officers
resident in Korea with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason. The base statutory severance accrues at the rate of approximately one month of base salary per year of
service and is calculated on a monthly basis based upon the officers salary for the prior three-month period. Accordingly, if the named executive officers in the following table had retired on the last day of our fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016, they would have been entitled to the statutory severance payments described below. Assuming no change in the applicable law, each of these executives will continue to accrue additional statutory severance benefits at the rate
described above until his or her service with us terminates.

Further Information Regarding Director Compensation 
Under our director compensation policy in effect in 2016, (i) each non-employee director received
a fee of $90,000 per year; (ii) the chairman of the Board received an additional fee of $75,000 per year; (iii) the chair of our Audit Committee received an additional fee of $25,000 per year; (iv) the chair of our Compensation
Committee received an additional fee of $15,000 per year; (v) the chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the chair of our Risk Committee each received an additional fee of $10,000 per year; (vi) each member of our
Audit Committee received an additional $15,000 per year, each member of Compensation Committee received an additional $10,000 per year and each member of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee received an additional fee
of $5,000 per year per committee; (vii) upon election to the Board of Directors, each non-employee director will be granted, pursuant to the Companys equity incentive plan as in effect at such time,
an option having a grant date fair value equal to $60,000, at an exercise price per share determined as the fair market value of a share on the date of grant and with vesting over one year at a rate of 100% on the first anniversary of grant, and a
restricted stock unit award having a grant date fair value equal to $60,000 with vesting over one year at a rate of 100% on the first anniversary of grant, with such grants to be made on the earlier of (A) the meeting date of the Companys
Annual Meeting of Stockholders for such year and (B) August 31 of such year; and (viii) if a non-employee directors initial appointment to the Board occurs other than at an Annual Meeting of
Stockholders of the Company, such director will be granted, pursuant to the Companys equity incentive plan as in effect at such time, an option (at an exercise price per share determined as the fair market value of a share on the date of
grant) and a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate grant date fair value equal to $120,000 multiplied by the quotient of the number of days elapsed from the date of initial appointment to the date of the Companys next Annual Meeting
of Stockholders (or, if earlier, August 31 of such year) divided by 365 (with each of the option and the restricted stock unit award to comprise 50% of such total grant), with such grants to vest 100% on the date of the Companys next
Annual Meeting of Stockholders (or, if earlier, August 31 of such year). In 2016, the Company changed the timing of payment of its annual and committee service fees to non-employee directors such that each of the cash payments referenced in the
preceding sentences was paid on the meeting date of the Companys 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the annual period of service beginning on such meeting date and continuing through the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. As
a result, the Company also made a prorated payment of director fees owed for the period from January 1, 2016 through July 31, 2016. Effective January 2017, the cash payments referenced above will be paid in quarterly installments for any fiscal
quarter during which a non-employee director serves on the Board of Directors. Our non-employee directors also receive certain fees for attending meetings of the Board
of Directors, the standing committees on which they serve and certain ad hoc committees on which they serve, including a fee of $10,000 for each on-site visit to the Companys Korean headquarters made by
a member of the Advisory Committee of the Board of Directors. Our director compensation policy in effect for 2016 also provided that the Lead Director of the Board, if any, would receive an additional fee of $45,000 per year. No Lead Director was
appointed for 2016. Mr. Klein is required by the internal policy of his employer, Avenue, to waive all compensation under the policy on a year-by-year basis. The
Board of Directors accepted his waiver of all compensation under the policy for his services as director during the year 2016.  Compensation Committee
Interlocks and Insider Participation  None of the members of the Compensation Committee has been an officer or employee of our Company
during the last fiscal year. During 2016, decisions regarding executive officer compensation were made by our Compensation Committee. Mr. YJ Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, participated in deliberations of our Compensation Committee regarding
the determination of compensation of our executive officers other than himself for 2016 and prior periods. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past has served, as a member of the board of directors or the compensation
committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors.  Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as set forth above under Compensation
Discussion and Analysis with our management and, based on such review and discussion, has recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The foregoing report was submitted by the
Compensation Committee and shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A promulgated by the SEC or Section 18 of the Exchange Act and shall not be incorporated by
reference in any of our other filings under the Securities Act or Exchange Act except to the extent we specifically incorporate this report therein.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our outstanding common stock for: (1) each person or
entity known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of any class of our outstanding securities; (2) each member of our Board of Directors; (3) each of our named executive officers; and (4) all of the members of our Board of Directors
and executive officers, as a group. The following tables list the number of shares and percentage of shares beneficially owned based on 33,553,688 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017. 
The amounts and percentages of equity interests beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC regulations governing the determination of
beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such
security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the securities as to which he or she has no economic
interest.  Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all
shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each person listed in the table below is c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Ltd., 215 Daesin-ro, Hungduk-gu, Cheongju-si, 361-725, Korea.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence  Related Person Transactions Policy 
Under our Related Person Transactions Policy, transactions involving our directors, executive officers, significant stockholders and other
related persons that involve an amount in excess of $120,000 must be approved by the Companys Audit Committee or, in the event it is determined that it is not practicable or desirable for the Company to wait until the next meeting of the full
Audit Committee, the Chair of the Audit Committee (who possesses delegated authority to act between Audit Committee meetings). The Audit Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable) will consider all of the relevant facts and
circumstances available to it, including (if applicable) but not limited to: the benefits to the Company; the impact on a directors independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediately family member of a director or an
entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the transaction; and the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees
generally. The Audit Committee may seek bids, quotes or independent valuations from third parties in connection with assessing any related person transaction. The Audit Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable) will approve only
those transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company, as the Audit Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable) determines in good faith. 
Registration Rights Agreement  On
November 9, 2009, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the holders of MagnaChip Semiconductor LLCs common units issued in our reorganization proceedings, including Avenue, where we granted them registration rights with
respect to our common stock for which the Company may incur fees and expenses in connection with the exercise of such registration rights. 
Exchangeable Notes Offering Stock Repurchase 
On January 17, 2017, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A. (the Issuer), closed an offering
(the Exchangeable Notes Offering) of $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes.  Engaged
Capital Flagship Master Fund, LP (Engaged Capital Flagship Master Fund), a fund for whom Engaged Capital, LLC (Engaged Capital) serves as investment advisor, purchased $4,496,288 principal amount of the Issuers
Exchangeable Senior Notes in the Exchangeable Notes Offering. Funds managed by Engaged Capital beneficially own approximately 12.1% of the Companys common stock (subject to certain blocker provisions in the Exchangeable Senior Notes that may
limit conversion to an aggregate of 9.99% of the Companys common stock). In connection with the Exchangeable Notes Offering, the Company also repurchased 347,850 and 52,150 shares of the Companys common stock from Engaged Capital
Flagship Master Fund, and a managed account for which Engaged Capital serves as investment adviser, respectively, at an aggregate purchase price of $2.21 million and $0.33 million, respectively. 
Director Independence  The Board of
Directors reviews the independence of each director annually. In determining the independence of our directors, our Board of Directors considered Section 303A of the NYSE listing standards and broadly considered the materiality of each
directors relationship with us. Based upon the foregoing criteria, our Board of Directors has determined that the following directors are independent: Mr. Melvin L. Keating,, Dr. Ilbok Lee, Mr. Camillo Martino, Mr. Gary
Tanner and Mr. Nader Tavakoli. Our Board of Directors also determined that R. Douglas Norby and Michael Elkins, each of whom served as a director during 2016, were independent based upon the foregoing criteria. In making such determination of
independence for Mr. Elkins under the applicable NYSE independence standards, the Board of Directors specifically considered Mr. Elkins previous employment and consulting arrangement with Avenue.

Policy and procedure for approval of audit and permitted non-audit services
 All audit fees were pre-approved by the Companys Audit Committee, which concluded that
the provision of such services by Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers and its affiliates was compatible with the maintenance of that firms independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. With respect to outside auditor independence, the Audit
Committee Charter provides for pre-approval of audit services and non-audit services, based on independence, qualifications and, if applicable, performance, and approve
the fees and other terms of any such engagement. The Audit Committee Charter authorizes the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more of its members the authority to grant pre-approvals for such services,
provided that the decisions of such member(s) to grant any such pre-approval shall be presented to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee followed these guidelines in approving all
services rendered by Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers and its affiliates.

MagnaChip unveils new MXsensor product family

Editor: Staff Editor
MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation announced a full range of “MXsensor” intelligent sensor product families featuring 0.18 micron mixed signal & analog technology with low power consumption.
The MXsensor families target the growing market for applications ranging from smartphone, tablet, and navigation to medical devices. The MXsensor families include e-Compass and digital Hall sensors. MagnaChip’s intelligent sensors provide cost-effective features such as small form-factor and multi-function integration as a result of its use of 0.18 micron mixed signal & analog technology and advanced design capabilities, as compared to currently available products.Sensors are used for many applications and their use is growing rapidly. Furthermore, today’s increasingly sophisticated devices require an emerging class of intelligent sensors in mass volume.  For instance, in handheld devices magnetic sensors are essential to implement compass-functionality and to detect the timing of opening and closing of a flip cover. MagnaChip’s intelligent sensor families address these magnetic sensor requirements with a new style of design made possible by integrating multiple functions and lowering power consumption utilizing MagnaChip’s own proprietary 0.18 micron mixed-signal technology.MagnaChip is charging ahead with its new 0.18 micron design in its target market segments, as the sensor industry as a whole needs to move to a more cost-effective smart sensor solution in order to meet lower cost and product differentiation objectives in areas such as smartphones. Several factors make the smartphone market particularly compelling for this new intelligent design.A recent report from the Gartner Group shows smartphone production growing by a CAGR of 61.6% from 2009 to 2012 with unit production continuing to increase due to emerging manufacturers and the growth of 4G / LTE networking. To make smartphones more attractive to consumers, design teams are turning to sensors as one way to differentiate their models by incorporating more user friendly interfaces and an overall better user experience.According to another recent report issued by Gartner Group, the non-optical sensor market will be growing by a CAGR of 12.1% from 2012 to 2017, which is partially attributed to the increasing number of sensors inside a mobile phone. For models manufactured in 2013, there are typically 12~13 sensors in a smartphone.MXM11XX Digital Hall Sensor FamilyThis fully-digitalized Hall sensor features 10-bit ADC (analog-digital converter) and programmable design flexibility. It presents numerous new functionalities over alternatives of conventional Hall switches. The self-calibration mode allows high-precision applications with an inexpensive magnet, while the I2C interface enables device makers to quickly provide value-added features through creative programming.“MagnaChip’s new MXsensor solutions are already creating great interest, particularly in the mobile device manufacturing sector,” said YJ Kim, Executive Vice President and General Manager of MagnaChip’s Display Solutions Division. “We look forward to meeting the needs of the smartphone and tablet communities and other industry sectors with the advanced feature set of the MXsensor series through our rapidly growing list of advanced  product offerings.”AvailabilityMXM11XX and MXG1300 families are currently being sampled and will go into production in Q3 2013. Evaluation kits are available through MagnaChip sales channels.

SEOUL, South Koreaand CUPERTINO, Calif., July 25, 2013/PRNewswire/ -- MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation ("MagnaChip") (NYSE: MX), a  Korean semiconductor company with a broad portfolio of analog and mixed-signal products and technologies, today announced a full range of "MXsensor" intelligent sensor product families featuring 0.18 micron mixed signal & analog technology with low power consumption. The MXsensor families target the growing market for applications ranging from smartphone, tablet, and navigation to medical devices. The MXsensor families include e-Compass and digital Hall sensors. MagnaChip's intelligent sensors provide cost-effective features such as small form-factor and multi-function integration as a result of its use of 0.18 micron mixed signal & analog technology and advanced design capabilities, as compared to currently available products.
      

        (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120305/NY61184LOGO)
      

        Sensors are used for many applications and their use is growing rapidly. Furthermore, today's increasingly sophisticated devices require an emerging class of intelligent sensors in mass volume.  For instance, in handheld devices magnetic sensors are essential to implement compass-functionality and to detect the timing of opening and closing of a flip cover. MagnaChip's intelligent sensor families address these magnetic sensor requirements with a new style of design made possible by integrating multiple functions and lowering power consumption utilizing MagnaChip's own proprietary 0.18 micron mixed-signal technology.
      

        MagnaChip is charging ahead with its new 0.18 micron design in its target market segments, as the sensor industry as a whole needs to move to a more cost-effective smart sensor solution in order to meet lower cost and product differentiation objectives in areas such as smartphones. Several factors make the smartphone market particularly compelling for this new intelligent design.
      

        A recent report from the Gartner Group shows smartphone production growing by a CAGR of 61.6% from 2009 to 2012 with unit production continuing to increase due to emerging manufacturers and the growth of 4G / LTE networking. To make smartphones more attractive to consumers, design teams are turning to sensors as one way to differentiate their models by incorporating more user friendly interfaces and an overall better user experience.
      

        According to another recent report issued by Gartner Group, the non-optical sensor market will be growing by a CAGR of 12.1% from 2012 to 2017, which is partially attributed to the increasing number of sensors inside a mobile phone. For models manufactured in 2013, there are typically 12~13 sensors in a smartphone.
      

        The MXsensor families include:
      

          MXM11XX Digital Hall Sensor Family
          
              This fully-digitalized Hall sensor features 10-bit ADC (analog-digital converter) and programmable design flexibility. It presents numerous new functionalities over alternatives of conventional Hall switches. The self-calibration mode allows high-precision applications with an inexpensive magnet, while the I2C interface enables device makers to quickly provide value-added features through creative programming. Please see today's accompanying press release for more information about this product.
            


          MXG1300 e-Compass Sensor Family
          
              This new e-Compass features both industry-comparable heading accuracy and power performance with MagnaChip's proprietary magnetic Hall sensor technology. The heading accuracy can enhance the user experience even under harsh magnetic-flux environments, while the better power performance extends battery life time for power-hungry mobile devices. Please see today's accompanying press release for more information about this product.
            


        "MagnaChip's new MXsensor solutions are already creating great interest, particularly in the mobile device manufacturing sector," said YJ Kim, Executive Vice President and General Manager of MagnaChip's Display Solutions Division. "We look forward to meeting the needs of the smartphone and tablet communities and other industry sectors with the advanced feature set of the MXsensor series through our rapidly growing list of advanced  product offerings."
      

        Availability
        MXM11XX and MXG1300 families are currently being sampled and will go into production in Q3 2013. Evaluation kits are available through MagnaChip sales channels.

 PROXY STATEMENT  ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON AUGUST 8, 2016  
GENERAL INFORMATION  Why am I receiving these materials? 
We sent you these proxy materials because the Board of Directors (the Board) of MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation (the
Company, MagnaChip, we, us, and our) is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting) and at any postponements or adjournments of
the Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held virtually via live interactive webcast on the Internet on August 8, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. If you held shares of our Common Stock on June 15, 2016 (the Record
Date), you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016 and vote on the proposals described below under the heading What am I voting on? However, you do not need to attend the Annual
Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may complete, sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy card. You may also vote over the Internet or by telephone.  The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Proxy Statement, the enclosed proxy card, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 are being mailed to stockholders
commencing on or about June 27, 2016.  What am I voting on? 
There are two proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
 


 
1.
Election of the seven director nominees specified in this Proxy Statement to serve until the 2017 Annual Meetings of Stockholders and until their respective successors
are elected and qualified; and 
 


 
2.
Ratification of the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

How does the Board recommend that I vote? 
Our Board recommends that you vote your shares:  FOR the election of each of the seven director nominees named in this Proxy Statement to hold office until the 2017 Annual Meetings of Stockholders and until their respective successors are
elected and qualified;  FOR the ratification of the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent
registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  Who can vote at the Annual Meeting?
 If you were a holder of record of the Companys common stock (the Common Stock) as of the close of
business on June 15, 2016, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, you may vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 34,731,754 shares of MagnaChip Common Stock outstanding, excluding treasury shares. Company
treasury shares will not be voted. Each stockholder has one vote for each share of Common Stock held as of the Record Date. 
  1 


Table of Contents
If, on the Record Date, your shares were held in an account at a broker, bank, or other
financial institution (we will refer to those organizations collectively as broker), then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that broker. The
broker holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote the shares in your account. As a beneficial owner, you
are invited to attend the Annual Meeting via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016. However, since you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a
valid proxy from your broker.  How can I attend the Annual Meeting? 
You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, if you are a stockholder or record or a beneficial owner as of June 15, 2016, live via
the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016. You must have your Control Number listed on the enclosed proxy card to enter the meeting. The webcast starts at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. You may vote and submit questions while
attending the meeting on the Internet. Instructions on how to attend and participate in the Annual Meeting via the Internet, including how to demonstrate proof of stock ownership, are posted at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016. The
audio broadcast will be archived on that website for one year.  What if I return the proxy card to the Company but do
not make specific choices?  If you return a signed, dated, proxy card to the Company without making any voting
selections, the Company will vote your shares (1) FOR the election of each of the seven director nominees named in this Proxy Statement to hold office until 2017 Annual Meetings of Stockholders and until their respective successors
are elected and qualified; and (2) FOR the ratification of the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
The Company does not expect that any matters other than the election of directors and the other proposals described in this Proxy
Statement will be brought before the Annual Meeting. The persons appointed as proxies will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof, including any
vote to postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting.  How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at
the Annual Meeting?  A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid annual meeting. A quorum will be present if
the holders of at least a majority of the total number of shares of Common Stock entitled to vote are present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and shares represented by broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present. If there are insufficient votes to constitute a quorum at the time of the Annual Meeting, we may adjourn the Annual Meeting to solicit additional proxies. 
How are votes counted and what is a broker non-vote? 
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count FOR,
AGAINST, WITHHOLD, abstentions and broker non-votes. A broker non-vote occurs when your broker submits a proxy card for your shares of Common Stock held in street name, but does not vote on a particular proposal
because the broker has not received voting instructions from you and does not have the authority to vote on that matter without instructions. Under the rules that govern brokers who are voting shares held in street name, brokers have the discretion
to vote those shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters. For purposes of these rules, the only routine matter in this Proxy Statement is Proposal Twothe ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for the
current fiscal year. Proposal Onethe election of directors is a non-routine matter. Therefore, if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker does not have discretion to vote your
shares on any proposal at the 
  2 


Table of Contents

Annual Meeting other than Proposal Twothe ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year. However, your shares will be considered present at
the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.  What is the voting requirement to approve
each of the proposals? 
Proposal OneElection of Directors 
The election of director nominees requires a plurality vote of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting
and entitled to vote in the election of directors. The director nominees receiving the highest number of FOR votes cast by the holders of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected. Accordingly,
WITHHOLD votes and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. Stockholders have no right to cumulative voting as to any matters, including the election of directors. 
Proposal TwoRatification of the Appointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Current Fiscal Year
 The proposal to ratify the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will be included in the number of shares present and entitled to vote and will therefore have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST this proposal. Brokers have discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal. 
How do I vote my shares of MagnaChip Common Stock?  Stockholders may vote shares of our Common Stock using any of the following means: 
Voting by Proxy Cards. A registered stockholder may vote shares until voting is completed at the Annual Meeting by returning a duly
completed and executed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope included. All proxy cards received by us that have been properly signed and have not been revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy cards. For your
mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it prior to the close of business on August 7, 2016.  Voting by
Telephone or Internet. A registered stockholder may vote shares until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 7, 2016 by calling the toll-free number indicated on the proxy card and following the recorded instructions or by accessing the
website indicated on the proxy card and following the instructions provided. When a stockholder votes by telephone or Internet, his, her or its vote is recorded immediately.  Voting by Internet During the Annual Meeting. Instructions on how to attend and vote at the meeting are described at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016. If a stockholder attends the
Annual Meeting and votes his, her or its shares during the meeting via the voting instructions described at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016, then any previous votes that were submitted by the stockholder, whether by Internet,
telephone or mail, will be superseded by the vote that such stockholder casts during the Annual Meeting. Further, if the shares are held of record by a broker and a stockholder wishes to vote at the Annual Meeting, he, she or it must obtain a proxy
issued in his, her or its name from the record holder in accordance with the materials and instructions for voting provided by his, her or its broker.  Voting by Street Name Stockholders. If stockholders hold shares in street name, then those stockholders may vote in accordance with the materials and instructions for voting
the shares provided by their broker. If street name stockholders wish to vote shares at the Annual Meeting, then they must obtain proxies from their broker in order to vote their shares at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the
materials and instructions for voting provided by his, her or its broker. If a street name stockholder does not vote by proxy or otherwise give voting instructions to their broker, such shares will not be voted by the broker for
Proposal One at the Annual Meeting.

Changing Votes. A stockholder may change his, her or its vote at any time before it
is voted at the Annual Meeting by (1) delivering a proxy revocation or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date to MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Inc., 60 South Market Street, Suite 750, San Jose, CA
95113, Attention: Secretary, which revocation or later-dated proxy is received by us prior to the close of business on August 7, 2016; (2) voting again by telephone or Internet in the manner described above prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern
Daylight Time, on August 7, 2016; or (3) attending the Annual Meeting and voting via the Internet during the meeting using the procedures described at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/mx2016. Attending the Annual Meeting via the
Internet will not revoke a proxy unless the stockholder actually votes via the Internet during the meeting. Street name stockholders who wish to revoke or change their votes after returning voting instructions to their broker may do so
in accordance with the materials and instructions provided by their broker or by contacting such broker to effect the revocation or change of vote.  How can I find out the results of the Annual Meeting?  Preliminary
voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. We will publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) within four business days of the Annual
Meeting. After the Form 8-K is filed, you may obtain a copy by visiting the investor relations section of our website or www.magnachip.com or by writing to MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Inc., 60 South
Market Street, Suite 750, San Jose, CA 95113, Attention: Secretary.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Independence  The Board reviews the independence of each director annually. In determining the independence of our directors, our Board considered Section 303A of the listing standards of the New York Stock
Exchange (the NYSE) and broadly considered the materiality of each directors relationship with us. Based upon the foregoing criteria, our Board has determined that the following directors are independent: Mr. Norby,
Mr. Elkins, Dr. Lee, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli.  Board Meetings 
The Board held 35 meetings during fiscal year 2015. All of the Directors attended at least 75% of the total meetings held by the Board and
by all committees on which he served during fiscal year 2015.  Attendance at Annual Meeting 
The Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines as currently in effect provides that all directors shall make every effort to attend
the Companys annual meeting of stockholders.  Committees 
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
and the Risk Committee. The Board has two ad hoc committees: the Finance Committee and the Strategic Review Committee.  The
Board has adopted written charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Risk Committee. These charters, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Corporate
Governance Guidelines, are posted and available on our website at www.magnachip.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement. 
Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee consists of Mr. Norby, as Chair, Mr. Elkins, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli. Following the Annual
Meeting, our Audit Committee will consist of Mr. Elkins, as Chair, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Norby is an audit
committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Our Board of Directors has also determined that each of
Mr. Norby, Mr. Elkins, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Tavakoli is independent as that term is defined in Section 303A of the NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act). In making such determination of independence for Mr. Elkins, the Board specifically considered Mr. Elkins previous employment and consulting arrangement with Avenue. 
The Audit Committee held six meetings in 2015. The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist our Board in fulfilling its
oversight responsibilities by reviewing and reporting to the Board on the integrity of the financial reports and other financial information provided by the Company to the public, the SEC and any other governmental regulatory body, and on the
Companys compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, retention, review and oversight of the Companys independent auditor, and the review and oversight of the
Companys internal financial reporting, policies and processes. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing related party transactions, risk management, and legal and ethics compliance.

Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Elkins, as Chair, Dr. Lee and Mr. Tavakoli. Following the Annual Meeting, our
Compensation Committee will consist of Mr. Tanner, as Chair, Mr. Elkins, Dr. Lee and Mr. Tavakoli, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Our Board has determined that each of Mr. Elkins, Dr. Lee
and Mr. Tavakoli is independent under NYSE listing standards. In making such determination of independence for Mr. Elkins, the Board specifically considered Mr. Elkins previous employment and consulting arrangement with Avenue.
 The Compensation Committee held eight meetings in 2015. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating
and approving our executive officer and director compensation plans, policies and programs, as well as all equity-based compensation plans and policies.  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  Our Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee consists of Dr. Lee, as Chair, Mr. Elkins and Mr. Norby. Following the Annual Meeting, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consist of Dr. Lee, as Chair, Mr. Elkins and
Mr. Tanner, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Our Board has determined that each of Dr. Lee, Mr. Elkins and Mr. Norby is independent under applicable NYSE listing standards and SEC rules. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings in 2015. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
identifies individuals qualified to become board members, recommends director nominees, recommends board members for committee membership, develops and recommends corporate governance principles and practices, oversees the evaluation of our Board
and its committees and formulates a description of the skills and attributes of desirable board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider candidates recommended by our stockholders so long as the proper procedures
are followed. 
Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual
meeting must provide timely notice of such nominations in writing. To be timely, a stockholders notice generally must be received in writing at the Companys offices at MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor,
Inc., 60 South Market Street, Suite 750, San Jose, CA 95113, Attention: Secretary, not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, nor later than the close of business on the 90th day, prior to the first anniversary of the date of the
preceding years annual meeting as first specified in the Companys notice of meeting (without regard to any postponements or adjournments of such meeting after such notice was first sent), except that if no annual meeting was held in the
previous year or the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholders to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the
annual meeting or the 10th day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. A stockholders notice must set forth, among other things, 
 


 

 
 the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination, and the names and addresses of the beneficial owners, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination is being made and of the person or persons to be nominated; 
 


 

 
 a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote for the election of Directors on the date of such
notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, 
 


 

 
 certain information regarding the ownership and other interests of the stockholder or such other beneficial owner; 
 


 

 
 a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder or such beneficial owner and each nominee and any other person or persons
(naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; 
  10 


Table of Contents


 

 
 a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three
years, and any other material relationships, between or among such stockholder and such other beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates and each proposed nominee; 
 


 

 
 certain other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant
to the proxy rules of the SEC; and 
 


 

 
 the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. 
A stockholder must also comply with all other applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the
Exchange Act with respect to matters relating to nominations of candidates for directors. The preceding is a summary of the stockholder nomination procedures set forth in our bylaws as currently in effect, and we refer our stockholders to the full
text of Section 2.15 and such other applicable provisions of our bylaws as in effect from time to time for the specific requirements of such director nomination procedures by stockholders. 
In addition to the formal procedures set forth in our bylaws for the nomination of directors by stockholders, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a Policy Regarding Director Nominations pursuant to which it may from time to time evaluate candidates for nomination as director that come to its attention through incumbent directors, management,
stockholders or third parties. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also, if it deems appropriate under the circumstances, engage a third-party search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates. Such informal recommendations
by stockholders should be directed to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as set forth below under Communications with Directors. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks director candidates who possess high quality business and professional
experience, possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values, and who have an inquisitive and objective perspective and mature judgment. Director candidates must also be committed to representing the best interests of our
stockholders and have sufficient time available in the judgment of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to perform all Board and committee responsibilities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has no formal policy on
diversity in identifying potential director candidates, but does regularly assess the needs of the Board for various skills, background and business experience in determining if the Board requires additional candidates for nomination. 
Risk Committee 
Our Risk Committee consists of Mr. Tavakoli, as Chair, Mr. Klein, Dr. Lee and Mr. Norby. Following the Annual Meeting,
our Risk Committee will consist of Mr. Tavakoli, as Chair, Mr. Klein and Dr. Lee, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. The Risk Committee held four meetings in 2015. The Risk Committee assists the Board in its
oversight of the Companys management of key risks, as well as the guidelines, policies and processes for monitoring and mitigating such risks. The Risk Committees primary responsibility is to oversee and approve the implementation of
Company-wide risk and crisis management best practices. Other responsibilities of the Risk Committee include providing input to management in identifying, assessing, mitigating and monitoring enterprise-wide risks the Company faces and reviewing the
Companys business practices, compliance activities and enterprise risk management and making recommendations to the Board related to such review.  Finance Committee  Our Finance Committee consists of Mr. Klein,
as Chair, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Elkins. Following the Annual Meeting, our Finance Committee will be composed of the same directors, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. The Finance Committee was established by the
Board of Directors on August 13, 2014 and 
  11 


Table of Contents

held four meetings in 2015. The Finance Committee reviews, oversees, analyzes, monitors and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to financial matters affecting the Company
and its subsidiaries, including capital structure plans and strategies, corporate treasury and banking functions, working capital budgeting management, compliance with debt covenants and communications with statistical rating organizations and other
credit rating agencies, capital expenditure plans and projects, financial investment plans and strategies, intercompany transfers, plans and strategies for hedging, material financing plans, tax structures and planning initiatives and annual
budgeting.  Strategic Review Committee  Our Strategic Review Committee consists of Mr. Klein, as Chair, Dr. Lee, Mr. Norby and Mr. Tanner. Following the Annual Meeting, our Strategic Review Committee will consist of
Mr. Klein, as Chair, Dr. Lee, Mr. Martino and Mr. Tanner, subject to their election as directors at the Annual Meeting. The Strategic Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors on June 16, 2015 and held four
meetings in 2015. The Strategic Review Committee assists the Board of Directors in reviewing, considering and evaluating strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including the potential sale of all or a substantial portion of the
Company. The Strategic Review Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding potential transactions and whether any such transaction is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders. In addition, the Strategic Review Committee may conduct negotiations concerning potential transactions and the terms and conditions thereof and is authorized to select and employ professional advisors in connection with its roles and
responsibilities.  Board Leadership Structure  Separation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Our Corporate
Governance Guidelines state that the Board of Directors shall elect its Chairman and appoint the Companys Chief Executive Officer according to its view of what is best for the Company at any given time. The Board does not believe there should
be a fixed rule as to whether the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be vested in the same person or two different people, or whether the Chairman should be an employee of the Company or should be elected from among the
non-employee directors. The needs of the Company and the individuals available to play these roles may dictate different outcomes at different times, and the Board believes that retaining flexibility in these decisions is in the best interest of the
Company.  Currently, Mr. Norby serves as the Companys Chairman of the Board and Mr. YJ Kim serves as the
Companys Chief Executive Officer. Following the Annual Meeting, Mr. Elkins will replace Mr. Norby as Chairman of the Board, subject to his election as a director at the Annual Meeting. The Board may, however, make changes to its
leadership structure in the future as it deems appropriate.  Lead Director 
In the event that positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person, on an annual basis the independent
members of the Board will select a lead director from the independent directors then serving on the Board (the Lead Director). The length of service as Lead Director is subject to the Boards discretion, but will be a minimum of one
year. The Lead Director has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors.  The duties and responsibilities of
the Lead Director include: (a) presiding at meetings if requested by the Chairman or in the absence of the Chairman, including presiding at executive sessions of the Boards non-employee directors and executive sessions of the independent
directors of the Board; (b) working with the Chairman and management in preparing Board meeting agendas and the need for special meetings; (c) facilitating communications between the Board and management and Board members ability to
influence 
  12 


Table of Contents

Board meeting agendas; (d) advising and consulting with the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman on matters related to governance and Board performance; (e) receiving, distributing to
the Board and arranging responses to communications from stockholders; (f) assisting in optimizing the effectiveness of the Board and its independence from management; (g) serving as liaison between the Chairman and the independent
directors; (h) meeting separately with each director at least annually; (i) evaluating the performance of the independent directors; and (j) performing such other duties as requested by the Board. The Lead Director shall be
compensated for his services as determined by the Compensation Committee.  Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors 
The Companys non-management directors meet at regularly scheduled Board meetings in executive session without management present. In
2015, the Chairman presided over the meetings of the non-management directors. In addition, in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent members of the Board meet at least twice a year in executive session, with the
Chairman setting the agenda and presiding over such meetings.  Presiding Director 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the presiding director of the Board is the Chairman of the Board, if present, or
in such persons absence and if applicable, the Lead Director, or in such persons absence, the Audit Committee Chair, or in such persons absence, the independent director present who has the most seniority on the Board. The
presiding director presides at all meetings of the Board and is responsible for chairing the Boards executive sessions.  
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our
directors, officers and employees. We will provide a copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics without charge to any person upon written request made to our Secretary at MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation, c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Inc.,
60 South Market Street, Suite 750, San Jose, CA 95113. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is also available on our website at www.magnachip.com. We will disclose any waivers or amendments to the provisions of our Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics on our website.  Assessment of Risk 
Our Board believes that our compensation programs are designed such that they will not incentivize unnecessary risk-taking. The base
salary component of our compensation program is a fixed amount and does not depend on performance. Our cash incentive program takes into account multiple factors, thus diversifying the risk associated with any single performance factor, and we
believe it does not incentivize our executive officers to focus exclusively on short-term outcomes. Our equity awards are limited by the terms of our equity plans to a fixed maximum amount specified in the plan, and are subject to vesting to align
the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our equityholders.  Report of the Audit
Committee  The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with our management and Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers, our
independent registered public accounting firm, our audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Audit Committee has also discussed with our independent registered public
accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU Section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting and Oversight Board in Rule
3200T.

Table of Contents
The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from
Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Samil PricewaterhouseCooperss communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with
Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers its independence.  Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee

restricted stock unit award having a grant date fair value equal to $60,000 with vesting over one year at a rate of 100% on the first anniversary of grant, with such grants to be made on the
earlier of (A) the meeting date of the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders for such year and (B) June 15 of such year; and (viii) if a non-employee directors initial appointment to the Board occurs other than at
an Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, such director will be granted, pursuant to the Companys equity incentive plan as in effect at such time, an option (at an exercise price per share determined as the fair market value of a share
on the date of grant) and a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate grant date fair value equal to $120,000 multiplied by the quotient of the number of days elapsed from the date of initial appointment to the date of the Companys next
Annual Meeting of Stockholders (or, if earlier, June 15 of such year) divided by 365 (with each of the option and the restricted stock unit award to comprise 50% of such total grant), with such grants to vest 100% on the date of the
Companys next Annual Meeting of Stockholders (or, if earlier, June 15 of such year). Each of the cash payments referenced in the preceding sentences will be paid on the earlier of (x) the meeting date of the Companys Annual
Meeting of Stockholders for such year and (y) June 15 of such year. Our director compensation policy in effect for 2015 also provided that the Lead Director of the Board, if any, would receive an additional fee of $45,000 per year. No Lead
Director was appointed for 2015. Mr. Klein and Mr. Mulhern are required by the internal policy of their employer, Avenue, to waive all compensation under the policy on a year-by-year basis. The Board of Directors accepted their waivers of
all compensation under the policy for their services as directors during the year 2015.  Compensation Committee
Interlocks and Insider Participation  None of the members of the Compensation Committee has been an officer or employee of
our Company during the last fiscal year. During 2015, decisions regarding executive officer compensation were made by our Compensation Committee. Mr. YJ Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, participated in deliberations of our Compensation
Committee regarding the determination of compensation of our executive officers other than himself for 2015 and prior periods. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past has served, as a member of the board of directors or the
compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Compensation Philosophy and Objectives  The Compensation Committee
of our Board of Directors, or the Committee, has overall responsibility for administering our compensation program for our named executive officers. The Committees responsibilities consist of evaluating, approving and monitoring
our executive officer and director compensation plans, policies and programs, as well as each of our equity-based compensation plans and policies. Prior to 2010, compensation decisions were made by the entire Board of Directors and for the
discussion that follows, references to the Committee during such period refer to the entire Board of Directors. For 2015, our named executive officers were:   



 
 Young-Joon Kim, our Chief Executive Officer; 
 



 
 Jonathan Kim, our Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; 
 



 
 Theodore Kim, our Chief Compliance Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; 
 



 
 Tae Jong Lee, our Executive Vice President and General Manager, Foundry Services Group; 
 



 
 Woung Moo Lee, our Executive Vice President and General Manager, Standard Products Group; and 
 



 
 Tae Young Hwang, our former Chief Operating Officer and President. 
The Committee seeks to establish total compensation for executive officers that is fair, reasonable and competitive. The Committee
evaluates our compensation packages to ensure that:   



 
 we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior executives in critical positions; 
 



 
 our executives are incentivized and rewarded for corporate growth, achievement of long-term corporate objectives and individual performance that meets
or exceeds our expectations without encouraging unnecessary risk-taking; and 
 



 
 compensation provided to critical executives remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly-situated executives of companies in the
semiconductor industry. 
The Committee believes that the most effective executive compensation packages
align executives interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that exceeds specific annual, long-term and strategic goals that are intended to improve stockholder value. These objectives include the achievement of
financial performance goals and progress on projects that our Board of Directors anticipates will lead to future growth, as discussed more fully below.  The information set forth below in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the Committees general philosophy and historical approach. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions  For named executive officers other than our chief executive officer, we have historically sought and considered input from our chief executive officer in making determinations regarding executive
compensation. Our chief executive officer annually reviews the performance of our other named executive officers. Our chief executive officer subsequently presents conclusions and recommendations regarding such officers, including proposed salary
adjustments and incentive amounts, to the Committee. The Committee then takes this information into account when it makes final decisions regarding any adjustments or awards.  The review of performance by the Committee and our chief executive officer of other executive officers is both an objective and subjective assessment of each executives contribution to our
performance, leadership 
  17 


Table of Contents

qualities, strengths and weaknesses and the individuals performance relative to goals set by the Committee or our chief executive officer, as applicable. The Committee and our chief
executive officer do not systematically assign a weight to the factors, and may, in their discretion, consider or disregard any one factor which, in their sole discretion, is important to or irrelevant for a particular executive. 
The Committees annual determinations regarding executive compensation are subject to the terms of the respective service agreements
between us and the named executive officers (as set forth in more detail below). In addition to the annual reviews, the Committee also typically considers compensation changes upon a named executive officers promotion or other change in job
responsibility. Neither our chief executive officer nor any of our other executives participates in deliberations relating to their own compensation.  Say on Pay Vote and Stockholder Input  The Committee also seeks to
ensure that the compensation paid to the Companys executive officers is aligned with the interests of the Companys stockholders. In that respect, as part of its ongoing review of the compensation paid to the Companys executive
officers, the Committee considered the approval by approximately 96.8% of the votes cast for the Say on Pay vote relating to the compensation of our named executive officers at the Companys 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
determined that the Companys executive compensation philosophy, compensation objectives, and compensation elements continued to be appropriate and did not make any changes to the Companys executive pay program in response to such
stockholder vote.  Role of Compensation Consultant  The Committee engages an external compensation consultant to assist it by providing information, analysis and other advice relating to our executive compensation program and the decisions resulting from
its annual executive compensation review. For 2015, the Committee retained Compensia Inc. (Compensia), a national compensation consulting firm, to serve as its compensation advisor. This compensation consultant serves at the discretion
of the Committee.  During 2015, Compensia provided the following services: 
 



 
 assisted the Committee in determining the design and amount equity awards for the key executives and Board members; 
 



 
 assisted the Committee in determining the appropriate pool of stock to grant to all employees in 2015; and 
 



 
 assisted the Committee in designing the short-term incentive plan for the key executives. 
In 2015, Compensia did not provide any services to us other than the consulting services to the Committee. The Committee regularly
reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice provided by its compensation consultant on executive compensation. In 2014, the Committee considered the six specific independence factors adopted by the SEC and reflected in the NYSE listing
standards and determined that the work of Compensia did not raise any conflicts of interest.  Timing of Compensation Decisions
 At the end of each fiscal year, our chief executive officer reviews the performance of the other executive officers
and present his conclusions and recommendations to the Committee. At that time and throughout the year, the Committee also evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer, which is measured in substantial part against our consolidated
financial performance. In January of the following fiscal year, the Committee then assesses the overall functioning of our compensation plans against our goals, and determines whether any changes to the allocation of compensation elements, or the
structure or level of any particular compensation element, are warranted. 
  18 


Table of Contents
In connection with this process, our Committee generally establishes the elements of its
performance-based cash bonus plan for the upcoming year. With respect to newly hired employees, our practice is typically to approve equity grants at the first meeting of the Committee following such employees hire date. We do not have any
program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with the release of material non-public information. From time to time, additional equity awards may be granted to executive officers during the fiscal year. 
Elements of Compensation  In making decisions regarding the pay of the named executive officers, the Committee looks to set a total compensation package for each officer that will retain high-quality talent and motivate executives
to achieve the goals set by our Board of Directors. Our 2015 compensation package was composed of the following elements:   



 
 annual base salary; 
 



 
 long-term equity incentives; 
 



 
 a benefits package that is generally available to all of our employees; and 
 



 
 expatriate and other executive benefits. 
Determination of Amount of Each Element of Compensation  General Background
 The Committee seeks to establish a total cash compensation package for our named executive officers that is competitive
with the compensation reflected in compensation data for similarly-situated executives in the peer group reviewed by the Committee, subject to adjustments based on each executives experience and performance. Historically, based on our review
of industry specific survey data and the professional and market experience of our Committee members, we measured total cash compensation for our named executive officers against cash compensation paid to executives at similarly situated companies
which we determined to be our select peer group. Base salaries for our named executive officers would then be benchmarked to median levels for companies in the select peer group, and adjusted upward or downward for performance. Short-term cash
incentives would be put in place to provide for opportunities that may result in higher than median levels of cash compensation as compared to our select peer group if, and depending upon the extent to which, our performance and that of our named
executive officers exceeded expectations and the goals established by the Committee for the year in question.  Competitive Positioning
 For purposes of comparing our executive compensation against the competitive market, the Committee reviews and
considers the compensation levels and practices of a group of comparable technology companies. The companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us in size, industry focus and geographic location.
 In October 2014, with the assistance of Compensia, the Committee developed our compensation peer group based on U.S.-based
semiconductor companies. We focused on U.S.-based semiconductor companies because our highest ranking executives are U.S. expatriates who have opportunities to work with U.S.-based semiconductor companies. The companies in this compensation peer
group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us, based on the following criteria:   



 
 industry  semiconductors; 
 



 
 similar revenue size  ~0.5x to ~2.0x our last four fiscal quarter revenue of approximately $856 million (approximately $428 million to
approximately $1.7 billion); 
  19 


Table of Contents



 
 executive positions similar in breadth, complexity and/or scope of responsibility; and 
 



 
 competitors for executive talent. 
The Committee approved the use of the market data from this peer group for our December 2014 executive compensation market assessment, which was used for setting executive compensation in 2015:
  






 Cirrus Logic
  
 OmniVision Technologies

 Cypress Semiconductor
  
 PMC-Sierra

 Diodes
  
 RF Micro Devices

 Fairchild Semiconductor
  
 Semtech

 Integrated Device Tech
  
 Silicon Laboratories

 International Rectifier
  
 Spansion

 Intersil
  
 SunEdison Semiconductor

 Microsemi
  
 TriQuint Semiconductor

To analyze the compensation practices of the companies in our compensation peer group, Compensia gathered
data from public filings (primarily proxy statements) and from the Radford Global Technology Survey as of July 2014 for companies with annual revenues between $500 million and $1 billion, with median revenues of $739 million. This market data was
then used as a reference point for the Committee to assess our current compensation levels in the course of its deliberations on compensation forms and amounts.  The Committee reviews our compensation peer group periodically prior to assessing executive compensation and makes adjustments to its composition, taking into account changes in both our business and the
businesses of the companies in the peer group.  The Committee historically makes annual determinations regarding cash
incentive compensation based on our annual operating plan, which we adopt in the December preceding each fiscal year. The determination takes into account our expected performance in the coming fiscal year. The Committee makes all equity
compensation decisions for our officers based on existing compensation arrangements for other executives at our Company with the same level of responsibility and based on a review of our select peer group with a view to maintaining internal
consistency and parity.  Equity awards are not tied to base salary or cash incentive amounts and will constitute lesser or
greater proportions of total compensation depending on the fair value of the awards. The Committee, relying on the professional and market experience of our Committee members, generally seeks to set equity awards at median levels of equity
compensation at our select peer group companies.  The Committee does not apply a formula or assign relative weight in making
its determination. Instead, it makes a subjective determination after considering all information collectively.  The Committee
may approve additional cash incentive payments or equity compensation grants from time to time during the year in its discretion.  Base
Salary  Base salary is the guaranteed element of an employees annual cash compensation. Changes in base salary may be
approved by the Committee for an executive if the median levels of base salary compensation for similarly-situated executives in our select peer group have changed, and may be further adjusted based upon the employees long-term performance,
skill set and the value of that skill. The Committee evaluates the performance of each named executive officer on an annual basis based on the accomplishment of performance objectives that were established at the beginning of the prior fiscal year
as well as its own subjective evaluation of the officers performance. In making its evaluation, the Committee makes a subjective qualitative assessment 
  20 


Table of Contents

of the officers contribution to our performance during the preceding year, including leadership, success in attaining particular goals of a division for which that officer has
responsibility, our overall financial performance and such other criteria as the Committee may deem relevant, including input from our chief executive officer. The Committee then makes a subjective decision regarding any changes in base salary based
on these factors and the data from our select peer group. The Committee does not systematically assign weights to any of the factors it considers, and may, in its discretion, ignore any factors or deem any one factor to have greater importance for a
particular executive officer. Base salary adjustments generally take effect in the middle of our fiscal year. The Committee increased base salaries for three of our named executive officers, Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim and Mr. T. Kim, for
the 2015 fiscal year.  Cash Incentives  Short-term cash incentives have historically comprised a significant portion of the total target compensation package and are designed to reward executives for their contributions to meeting and exceeding
our goals and to recognize and reward our executives in achieving these goals. Incentives are typically designed as a percentage of base salary and are awarded based on individual performance and our achievement of the annual, long-term and
strategic quantitative goals set by our Committee.  In December 2009, our Board of Directors implemented a cash incentive plan
effective as of January 1, 2010, which we call the Profit Sharing Plan. Each of our employees is eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan, and our Board of Directors intends for the Profit Sharing Plan to incentivize our named
executive officers, officers and employees to exceed expectations throughout our entire fiscal year. The Committee administers the Profit Sharing Plan.  Under the Profit Sharing Plan, the Committee reviews our business plan in December of each year and determines an annual consolidated Adjusted EBITDA target, or the Base Target, for the upcoming fiscal
year and sets the targeted amount to be awarded to our named executive officers and employees, or the Profit Share, for meeting the Base Target and for achievement in excess of the Base Target. 
For our 2015 fiscal year, the Committee determined that it is in the best interest of the Company to increase the target annual
performance bonus percentages for three of our named executive officers, Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim and Mr. T. Kim.  Equity
Compensation  In addition to our historical use of cash incentives, we offer equity incentives as a way to enhance the link
between the creation of stockholder value and executive incentive compensation and to give our executives appropriate motivation and rewards for achieving increases in enterprise value. Under our 2009 Common Unit Plan, our Board of Directors
previously granted options to acquire MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC common units and restricted unit bonus awards. Awards under our 2009 Common Unit Plan were converted into options for common stock and restricted common stock of MagnaChip
Semiconductor Corporation upon our corporate conversion. Such options vest in installments over three years following grant, with approximately one-third of the restricted unit awards vested at grant and the remainder vesting in two subsequent
annual installments, as set forth in more detail below.  Under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the 2009 Common
Unit Plan immediately following our corporate conversion, the Committee may grant participants stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units, and other stock-based and cash-based
awards. Stock options granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan prior to 2015 generally vest over three years following grant, with thirty-four percent of the common stock vesting and becoming exercisable on the first anniversary of grant date
and eight or nine percent of the common stock subject to the options vesting on completion of each three-month period thereafter. Stock options granted in 2015 generally vest fifty percent on the date of grant, with the remaining fifty percent
vesting and becoming exercisable in three equal annual 
  21 


Table of Contents

installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan generally vest fifty percent on the date of
grant, with the remaining fifty percent vesting in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Settlement of vested RSUs generally occurs as soon as practicable following the vesting date. In granting equity
awards, the Committee may establish any conditions or restrictions it deems appropriate. Stock options and stock appreciation rights must have exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the stock at the time of their grant pursuant
to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. The fair market value of the stock at the time of grant will generally be the closing price of a share of stock as quoted on the national or regional securities exchange or quotation system constituting the primary
market for the stock on the date any grant is made. Prior to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation or settlement of an award denominated in units, the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the stock subject to the
award, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends. Participants receiving restricted stock awards are stockholders and have both voting rights and the right to receive dividends, except that dividends paid on unvested shares may
remain subject to forfeiture until vested. Award vesting ceases upon termination of employment, and vested options and stock appreciation rights remain exercisable only for a limited period following such termination. 
The Committee considers granting additional equity compensation in the event of new employment, a promotion or change in job
responsibility or a change in median levels of equity compensation for similarly-situated executives at companies in our select peer group or in its discretion to reward or incentivize individual officers. The equity award levels vary among
participants based on their job grade and position. The Committee generally seeks to award equity compensation at levels consistent with the median levels for executives at companies in our select peer group, and will also make subjective
determinations regarding adjustments to award amounts in light of factors such as the available pool, individual performance and role of executives. For example, the Committee may adjust the size of an award for an individual executive above the
equity award level for his or her position if the Committee determines that the executive has provided exceptional performance, or may increase the equity award level for a position above the median level reflected in the select peer group if the
position is considered by the Committee to be more critical to our long-term success. The Committee will generally maintain substantially equivalent award levels for executives at equivalent job grades. Equity awards are not tied to base salary or
cash incentive amounts.  As a result of our 2009 reorganization proceedings, all previously outstanding common and preferred
units and options held by our named executive officers were cancelled. In December 2009, we granted new options to our executives with the option award amounts generally determined based upon the median levels of our select peer group. Thirty-four
percent of the common units subject to the options vested and became exercisable on the first anniversary of grant date, with eight or nine percent of the common units subject to the options vesting on completion of each three-month period
thereafter. In January 2012, because the options granted in December 2009 would vest by the end of that year, the Committee granted additional options to all of our named executive officers, other than Mr. YJ Kim, who joined the Company in
April 2013, Mr. J. Kim, who joined the Company in March 2014, and Mr. T. Kim, who joined the Company in October 2013. In 2014, Mr. J. Kim received grants of options to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 shares arising out of the
commencement of his employment with the Company. In 2015, the Committee granted options and RSUs to all of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Hwang, who resigned his positions with the Company effective as of April 30, 2015.
 Upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors or chief executive officer, or otherwise, the Committee may in the future
consider granting additional performance-based equity incentives.  Perquisites and Other Benefits 
We provide the named executive officers with perquisites and other benefits, including expatriate benefits, that the Committee believes
are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. Generally, perquisites are determined based upon what the Committee considers to be the most
customary perquisites offered by our select peer group and are not based upon a median cost for specific perquisites or for the perquisites in aggregate. The Committee 
  22 


Table of Contents

determines the level and types of expatriate benefits for the executive officers based on local market surveys taken by our human resources group. These surveys are not limited to our select peer
group, but include a broad range of non-Korea based companies with significant operations in Korea. Attributed costs of the personal benefits for the named executive officers are as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim and Mr. T. Kim were expatriates during 2015 and 2014. Mr. YJ Kim and Mr. T. Kim were also
expatriates during 2013. Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim and Mr. T. Kim received expatriate benefits commensurate with market practice in Korea. These benefits, which were determined on an individual basis, included housing allowances,
relocation and repatriation allowances, insurance premiums, reimbursement for the use of a car, home leave flights, living expenses, childrens tuition allowances, tax equalization payments and tax advisory services, each as we deemed
appropriate.  In addition, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act, certain executive officers resident in
Korea with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason. For purposes of this section, we call this benefit statutory severance. The base statutory severance is
approximately one month of base salary per year of service. Mr. YJ Kim, Mr. J. Kim, Mr. T. Kim, Mr. TJ Lee, Mr. WM Lee and Mr. Hwang accrued statutory severance in 2015. 
Certain Tax Considerations  We consider tax implications when we design our equity-based and cash compensation programs and when we make awards or grants. In particular, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally
disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1,000,000 paid to covered employees (which are defined as our named executive officers, other than the chief financial officer). However, qualifying performance-based
compensation is not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met. Although deductibility is a factor that the Committee takes into account in determining awards of cash bonuses and equity grant, the Committee may award compensation
that is not deductible under Section 162(m) when, in the exercise of the Committees judgment, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to do so.

MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC 2009 Common Unit Plan  Following our
emergence from our reorganization proceedings, in December 2009, our Board of Directors adopted, and our equityholders approved, the MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC 2009 Common Unit Plan, which we refer to as the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provided for
the grant of nonstatutory options, restricted unit bonus and purchase right awards, and deferred unit awards to employees and consultants of our Company and our subsidiaries and to members of our Board of Directors. However, only options and
restricted unit bonus awards 
  27 


Table of Contents

were granted under the 2009 Plan. Subject to adjustment in the event of certain changes in capital structure, the maximum aggregate number of MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC common units available
for grant under the 2009 Plan was 30,000,000. Units subject to awards that expired, were forfeited or otherwise terminated would have been available again for grant under the 2009 Plan. 
In connection with our corporate conversion, MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation assumed the rights and obligations of MagnaChip
Semiconductor LLC under the 2009 Plan and converted MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC common unit options and restricted common units outstanding under the 2009 Plan into options to acquire a number of shares of our common stock and shares of restricted
common stock at a ratio of eight-for-one on substantially equivalent terms and conditions. As of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding under the 2009 Plan options to purchase 852,449 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise
price of $6.22 per share. The 2009 Plan terminated immediately following our corporate conversion, and no additional options or other equity awards may be granted under the 2009 Plan. However, options granted under the 2009 Plan prior to its
termination will remain outstanding until they are either exercised or expire.  The 2009 Plan is administered by the
Committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2009 Plan, the Committee determined in its discretion the persons to whom and the times at which awards were granted, the sizes of such awards, and all of their terms and conditions. All awards were
evidenced by a written agreement between us and the holder of the award. The Committee has the authority to construe and interpret the terms of the 2009 Plan and awards granted under it. 
In the event of a change in control of our Company, the vesting of all outstanding awards held by participants whose employment has not
previously terminated will accelerate in full. In addition, the Committee has the authority to require that outstanding awards be assumed or replaced with substantially equivalent awards by a successor corporation or to cancel the outstanding awards
in exchange for a payment in cash or other property equal to the fair market value of restricted units or the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the units subject to an option over the exercise price per unit of such option. 
2011 Equity Incentive Plan  Our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors and our stockholders in March 2010. We amended and restated the 2011 Plan in February 2011, and our stockholders
approved the amendment in March 2011 to reflect that it became effective in 2011 upon our corporate conversion. 891,703 shares of our common stock, or the total number of shares of common stock (as adjusted by the conversion ratio in the corporate
conversion) that remained available for grant upon the termination of the 2009 Plan immediately following the corporate conversion, were initially authorized and reserved.  As of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding under the 2011 Plan options to purchase 2,327,450 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $10.85 per share. As of
December 31, 2015, 894,790 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. This reserve automatically increased on January 1, 2014, January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016 by an additional
680,967, 681,129 and 691,378 shares, respectively, and will automatically increase each subsequent anniversary through 2021, by an amount equal to the smaller of 2% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately
preceding December 31 or an amount determined by our Board of Directors. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan will also be increased from time to time by up to that number of shares of common stock remaining subject
to options and restricted stock awards outstanding under the 2009 Plan at the time of its termination immediately following the corporate conversion that expire or terminate or are forfeited for any reason after the effective date of the 2011 Plan,
subject to a cap of 1,412,352 shares. Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and other numerical limits in the 2011 Plan and in outstanding awards to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in
the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to awards granted under our 2011 Plan which expire, are repurchased, or are cancelled or forfeited will again become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. The

  28 


Table of Contents

shares available will not be reduced by awards settled in cash. Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations will not again become available for grant. The gross number of shares issued
upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights or options exercised by means of a net exercise or by tender of previously owned shares will be deducted from the shares available under the 2011 Plan. 
Awards may be granted under the 2011 Plan to our employees, including officers, directors, or consultants or those of any present or
future parent or subsidiary corporation or other affiliated entity. While we may grant incentive stock options only to employees, we may grant nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights or bonuses,
restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and cash-based awards or other stock-based awards to any eligible participant.  The 2011 Plan is administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2011 Plan, the Committee determines in its discretion the persons to whom and the times at which awards are granted, the
sizes of such awards, and all of their terms and conditions. All awards are evidenced by a written agreement between us and the holder of the award. The Committee has the authority to construe and interpret the terms of the 2011 Plan and awards
granted under it.  In the event of a change in control as described in the 2011 Plan, the acquiring or successor entity may
assume or continue all or any awards outstanding under the 2011 Plan or substitute substantially equivalent awards. Any awards which are not assumed or continued in connection with a change in control or are not exercised or settled prior to the
change in control will terminate effective as of the time of the change in control. The Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting of any or all outstanding awards upon such terms and to such extent as it determines, except that the
vesting of all awards held by members of our Board of Directors who are not employees will automatically be accelerated in full. The 2011 Plan also authorizes the Committee, in its discretion and without the consent of any participant, to cancel
each or any outstanding award denominated in shares upon a change in control in exchange for a payment to the participant with respect to each share subject to the cancelled award of an amount equal to the excess of the consideration to be paid per
share of common stock in the change in control transaction over the exercise price per share, if any, under the award.  The
Board has delegated to a special equity committee composed of our chief executive officer the authority to grant and administer RSU awards covering up to a total of 312,000 shares to up to 1,100 nonunion employees of the Company (other than
executive officers), with a maximum grant size of 1,000 shares per employee. Such RSUs will become vested and settled upon the first to occur of (i) April 1, 2017 or (ii) the date of the consummation of a change in control.
 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  Our 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Purchase Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors in March 2010. Our Board of Directors amended and restated the Purchase Plan in February 2011 to reflect
that the Purchase Plan would become effective in 2011 upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. The Purchase Plan was approved by our stockholders in March 2011 and became effective upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. We initially
authorized and reserved 789,890 shares for sale under the Purchase Plan. In August, 2012, the Committee suspended the Purchase Plan.  As of December 31, 2015, 1,163,880 shares of our common stock remained reserved for sale under the Purchase Plan. In addition, the Purchase Plan provides for an automatic annual increase in the
number of shares available for issuance under the plan on January 1 of each year beginning in 2012 and continuing through and including January 1, 2021 equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common
stock on the immediately preceding December 31, (ii) 789,980 shares, or (iii) a number of shares as our Board of Directors may determine. Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and in outstanding
purchase rights to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to purchase rights which expire or are canceled will again

  29 


Table of Contents

become available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Because the Purchase Plan was suspended in August 2012, no annual increase in the number of shares authorized under such plan occurred on
January 1, 2013 or in subsequent years.  Our employees and employees of any parent or subsidiary corporation designated
by the Committee are eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan if they are customarily employed by us for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted a right to purchase
stock under the Purchase Plan if: (i) the employee immediately after such grant would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock or of any parent or subsidiary corporation, or
(ii) the employees rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in value for each calendar year of participation in such plans. 
The Purchase Plan is implemented through a series of sequential offering periods, generally three months in duration beginning on the
first trading days of February, May, August, and November each year. The Committee is authorized to establish additional or alternative concurrent, sequential or overlapping offering periods and offering periods having a different duration or
different starting or ending dates, provided that no offering period may have a duration exceeding 27 months.  Amounts
accumulated for each participant, generally through payroll deductions, are credited toward the purchase of shares of our common stock at the end of each offering period at a price generally equal to 95% of the fair market value of our common stock
on the purchase date. Prior to commencement of an offering period, the Committee is authorized to change the purchase price discount for that offering period, but the purchase price may not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
our common stock at the beginning of the offering period or on the purchase date.  No participant may purchase under the
Purchase Plan in any calendar year shares having a value of more than $25,000 measured by the fair market value per share of our common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period. Prior to the beginning of any offering period, the
Committee may alter the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any participant during the offering period or specify a maximum aggregate number of shares that may be purchased by all participants in the offering period. If insufficient
shares remain available under the plan to permit all participants to purchase the number of shares to which they would otherwise be entitled, the Committee will make a pro rata allocation of the available shares. Any amounts withheld from
participants compensation in excess of the amounts used to purchase shares will be refunded, without interest.  In the
event of a change in control, an acquiring or successor corporation may assume our rights and obligations under the Purchase Plan. If the acquiring or successor corporation does not assume such rights and obligations, then the purchase date of the
offering periods then in progress will be accelerated to a date prior to the change in control as specified by the Committee, but the number of shares subject to outstanding purchase rights shall not be adjusted. 
Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
We are obligated to make certain payments to our named executive officers upon termination or a change in control as further described
below. The terms cause and good reason used below have the meanings given to them in the applicable agreements with us.  Young-Joon Kim. We entered into an Offer Letter with Mr. YJ Kim, dated as of April 15, 2013, pursuant to which Mr. YJ Kim is entitled to an initial annual base salary of
$350,000 per year (subject to adjustment by our Board of Directors), a one-time signing bonus and relocation allowance of $100,000, and an annual incentive bonus target of 80% of his annual base salary based on company performance and attainment of
management

on May 6, 2013, Mr. YJ Kim received an initial grant of an option to purchase an aggregate of 200,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $15.96, which vests and becomes exercisable over three years from the
date of commencement of Mr. YJ Kims employment with MagnaChip Korea. We entered into a Severance Agreement with Mr. YJ Kim, dated as of November 3, 2015, which supersedes the severance provisions in Mr. YJ Kims Offer
Letter. Under the Severance Agreement, if Mr. YJ Kims employment is terminated by us without cause or by him with good reason, in addition to accrued but unpaid salary, vested non-severance benefits under other Company benefit plans and
statutory severance under Korean law, Mr. YJ Kim will be entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to two times his then current base salary, payable during the 12 month period following termination of employment, (ii) an amount equal
to his then current base salary, payable in a single cash lump sum following termination of employment, (iii) for 12 months following termination of employment, payment of any portion of health benefit premiums that are in excess of the amount
he would have paid if he had remained employed during such period, (iv) continued provision of expatriate benefits for 12 months following termination of employment, (v) continued reasonable use of our corporate club membership for 12
months following termination of employment, (vi) a repatriation allowance and repatriation expenses in accordance with our expatriate benefit policy, and (vii) immediate vesting of all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including,
without limitation, stock options and RSUs) upon termination of employment, with any stock options remaining outstanding and exercisable for two years following such termination (or the expiration of the option, if earlier). If such termination of
employment by us without cause or by Mr. YJ Kim with good reason occurs within three months prior or 18 months following a change in control, in addition to the benefits described in the preceding sentence, Mr. YJ Kim will also be entitled
to receive (i) an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable in a single cash lump sum following termination of employment, and (ii) an additional 6 months of payments of health benefit premiums as described in part
(iii) of the preceding sentence. The Severance Agreement also provides that, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by Mr. YJ Kim will
become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under the Severance Agreement is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that
a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a change in control for purposes of the Severance Agreement but not the 2011
Equity Incentive Plan. As a condition to the receipt of payments and benefits under the severance agreement, Mr. YJ Kim must comply with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two year post-termination non-competition covenant
and perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants.  Jonathan Kim. We entered into an Offer

customary employee benefits and expatriate benefits. Pursuant to his Offer Letter, Mr. J. Kim will receive an initial grant of an option to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 shares of the Companys common stock, which will be granted in four
equal tranches during the nine-month period beginning on the commencement of his employment with MagnaChip Korea. The option grants will become vested and exercisable over three years from the date of commencement of Mr. J. Kims
employment with MagnaChip Korea. We entered into a Severance Agreement with Mr. J. Kim, dated as of November 3, 2015, which supersedes the severance provisions in Mr. J. Kims Offer Letter. Under the Severance Agreement, if
Mr. J. Kims employment is terminated by us without cause or by him with good reason, in addition to accrued but unpaid salary, vested non-severance benefits under other Company benefit plans and statutory severance under Korean law,
Mr. J. Kim will be entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable during the 12 month period following termination of employment, (ii) an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable in a

and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by Mr. J. Kim will become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of
change in control under the Severance Agreement is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products
Group or foundry business lines, is a change in control for purposes of the Severance Agreement but not the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. As a condition to the receipt of payments and benefits under the severance agreement, Mr. J. Kim must comply
with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two year post-termination non-competition covenant and perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants.

Mr. T. Kim will be paid an initial base salary of $280,000 per year (subject to adjustment by our Board of Directors), and an annual incentive bonus of up to 30% of his base salary based on company performance and attainment of management

Kims employment is terminated by us without cause or by him with good reason, in addition to accrued but unpaid salary, vested non-severance benefits under other Company benefit plans and statutory severance under Korean law, Mr. T. Kim
will be entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable during the 12 month period following termination of employment, (ii) an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable in a single cash lump

is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a change in

Plan. As a condition to the receipt of payments and benefits under the severance agreement, Mr. T. Kim must comply with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two year
post-termination non-competition covenant and perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants.  Tae
Jong Lee. We entered into an Offer Letter with Mr. TJ Lee, dated as of June 20, 2007, pursuant to which Mr. TJ Lee will be paid an initial base salary of 170,000,000 Korean won per year (subject to adjustment by our Board of
Directors), a sign on bonus of 20,000,000 Korean won, a one-time relocation payment of 8,000,000 Korean won, and an annual incentive bonus with a target of 50% of his base salary based on company performance and attainment of management objectives

with Mr. TJ Lee, dated as of November 3, 2015, which supersedes the severance provisions in Mr. TJ Lees Offer Letter. Under the Severance Agreement, if Mr. TJ Lees employment is terminated by us without cause or by
him with good reason, in addition to accrued but unpaid salary, vested non-severance benefits under other Company benefit plans and statutory severance under Korean law, Mr. TJ Lee will be entitled to receive (i) an amount equal to his

Mr. TJ Lee must comply with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two year post-termination non-competition covenant and perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants. 
Woung Moo Lee. We entered into an Offer Letter with Mr. WM Lee, dated as of October 16, 2013, pursuant to which
Mr. WM Lee will be paid an initial base salary of 230,000,000 Korean won per year (subject to adjustment by our Board of Directors), and an annual incentive of up to 30% of his base salary based on company performance and attainment of

(including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) upon termination of employment, with any stock options remaining outstanding and exercisable for two years following such termination (or
the expiration of the option, if earlier). If such termination of employment by us without cause or by Mr. WM Lee with good reason occurs within three months prior or 18 months following a change in control, in addition to the benefits
described in the preceding sentence, Mr. WM Lee will also be entitled to receive an amount equal to his then current base salary, payable during the 12 month period following termination of employment. The Severance Agreement also provides
that, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by Mr. WM Lee will become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of
immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under the Severance Agreement is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual
revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a change in control for purposes of the Severance Agreement but not the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. As a condition to the receipt of payments and
benefits under the severance agreement, Mr. WM Lee must comply with the terms of certain restrictive covenants, including a two year post-termination non-competition covenant and perpetual non-disclosure and employee non-solicitation covenants.
 Tae Young Hwang. We entered into an Entrustment Agreement with Mr. Hwang, effective as of October 1,
2004, under which he served as our Chief Operating Officer and President, with an initial base salary of 220 million Korean won per year and with a target annual incentive bonus to be determined by management based on performance.
Mr. Hwang was entitled to customary employee benefits. The agreement also contains customary non-competition covenants lasting one year from the date of termination of employment and confidentiality covenants of unlimited duration. If
Mr. Hwangs employment terminates for any reason, he is entitled to statutory severance payments pursuant to the Korean Commercial Code or any other statute.  Effective April 30, 2015, Tae Young Hwang resigned as our Chief Operating Officer and President and from all other officer and director positions with the Company and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries. In connection with Mr. Hwangs resignation, on April 30, 2015, Mr. Hwang and MagnaChip Korea entered into an Advisory Services and Separation Agreement, or the Hwang Separation Agreement, which provides for
Mr. Hwangs separation from MagnaChip Korea effective as of May 31, 2015. Under the Hwang Separation Agreement, Mr. Hwang will provide advisory services to the Company for a term of 24 months. The advisory services will relate
to: supporting the Companys Chief Executive Officer; the Companys production processes; transition matters; the Companys LG Display business; labor union negotiations; cooperation with the Company in connection with any pending
litigation or investigation relating to the Company or its affiliates; and any other matters the Company requests in its reasonable discretion. Mr. Hwang will be paid a monthly amount of 27,439,200 Korean won (approximately $25,412.55, with
Korean won converted into U.S. Dollars at a reference conversion rate of 1,079.75 Korean won to 1 U.S. Dollar), which is equal to 80% of his current monthly salary, during the term of the Hwang Separation Agreement, payable on a monthly basis, for
providing such advisory services. The Hwang Separation Agreement contains a general release of claims, a non-disparagement agreement and a confidentiality agreement by Mr. Hwang. The Hwang Separation Agreement also contains covenants by
Mr. Hwang that during the term he provides advisory services to the Company and for one year after the conclusion of such term he will not engage in any activities or services that are competitive with the Company or any of its affiliates or
solicit any of the Companys employees. In consideration for Mr. Hwangs advisory services and for the other terms agreed by Mr. Hwang in the Hwang Separation Agreement, the Company paid Mr. Hwang a lump sum payment of 100%
of his accrued pension benefits as of the effective date of the Hwang Separation Agreement. The value of Mr. Hwangs accrued pension benefits as of May 31, 2015, the effective date of the Hwang Separation Agreement, was 1,103,424,670
Korean won (approximately $1,021,926.07). The Hwang Separation Agreement also provides that all stock options held by Mr. Hwang will be exercisable for 18 months following the effective date of the Hwang Separation Agreement.

as further described under the section entitled Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control. The terms cause and good
reason used below have the meanings given to them in the applicable agreements with us.  Change in Control.
The Committee has the authority to require that outstanding equity awards be assumed or replaced with substantially equivalent awards by the successor corporation or to cancel the outstanding awards in exchange for a payment in cash or other
property equal to the fair market value of restricted units or the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the units subject to an option over the exercise price per unit of such option. For purposes of the foregoing, a change in
control is generally defined as the acquisition by a person or entity of more than 51% of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets to a
person or entity that is not our affiliate. The severance agreements with our named executive officers other than Mr. Hwang each provides that, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding and unvested equity awards (including, without
limitation, stock options and RSUs) held by such executive will become immediately vested and, in the case of options, exercisable, as of immediately prior to such change in control. The definition of change in control under such severance
agreements is the same as under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, except that a sale of assets representing at least 65% of our consolidated annual revenue or assets, or a sale of either of our Standard Products Group or foundry business lines, is a
change in control for purposes of such severance agreement but not the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.  The following tables
present our estimate of the dollar value of the payments and benefits payable to our named executive officers upon the occurrence of certain terminations of their employment and upon a change in control, assuming that each such event occurred on
December 31, 2015 (except for Mr. Hwang, whose employment terminated during 2015), and assuming a closing per share price of $5.29 on December 31, 2015. The disclosure in the following table does not include: 
 



 
 any accrued benefits that were earned and payable as of December 31, 2015; or 
 



 
 payments and benefits to the extent they are provided generally to all salaried employees and do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor
of the named executive officers.

Pension Benefits for the Fiscal Year Ended
December 31, 2015  In addition to the severance benefits described above, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Benefit
Security Act, certain executive officers resident in Korea with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason. The base statutory severance accrues at the rate of
approximately one month of base salary per year of service and is calculated on a monthly basis based upon the officers salary for the prior three-month period. Accordingly, if the named executive officers in the following table had retired on
the last day of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, they would have been entitled to the statutory severance payments described below. Assuming no change in the applicable law, each of these executives will continue to accrue additional
statutory severance benefits at the rate described above until his or her service with us terminates.

In December 2009, our Board of Directors adopted, and our equityholders approved, the MagnaChip Semiconductor
LLC 2009 Common Unit Plan, which we refer to as the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provided for the grant of nonstatutory options, restricted unit bonus and purchase right awards, and deferred unit awards to employees and consultants of our Company and
our subsidiaries and to members of our Board of Directors. However, only options and restricted unit bonus awards were granted under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan terminated immediately following our corporate conversion, and no additional options or
other equity awards may be granted under the 2009 Plan. However, options granted under the 2009 Plan prior to its termination will remain outstanding until they are either exercised or expire. As of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding
under the 2009 Plan options to purchase 852,449 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $6.22 per share.  The 2011 Plan was approved by our Board of Directors and our stockholders in March 2010. We amended and restated the 2011 Plan in February 2011, and our stockholders approved the amendment in March 2011
to reflect that it became effective in 2011 upon our corporate conversion. 891,703 shares of our common stock, or the total number of shares of common stock (as adjusted by the conversion ratio in the corporate conversion) that remained available
for grant upon the termination of the 2009 Plan immediately following the corporate conversion, were initially authorized and reserved.  As of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding under the 2011 Plan options to purchase 2,327,450 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $10.85 per share. As of
December 31, 2015, 894,790 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. This reserve automatically increased on January 1, 2015 by 681,129 shares and automatically increased on January 1, 2016 by
691,378 shares and will automatically increase each subsequent anniversary through 2021, by an amount equal to the smaller of 2% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or an
amount determined by our Board of Directors. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan will also be increased from time to time by up to that number of shares of common stock remaining subject to options and restricted stock
awards outstanding under the 2009 Plan at the time of its

termination immediately following the corporate conversion that expire or terminate or are forfeited for any reason after the effective date of the 2011 Plan, subject to a cap of 1,412,352
shares. Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and other numerical limits in the 2011 Plan and in outstanding awards to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in the event of a stock split or
other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to awards granted under our 2011 Plan which expire, are repurchased, or are cancelled or forfeited will again become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. The shares available will not be
reduced by awards settled in cash. Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations will not again become available for grant. The gross number of shares issued upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights or options exercised by means of a
net exercise or by tender of previously owned shares will be deducted from the shares available under the 2011 Plan.  For more
information on our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, see Compensation Discussion and AnalysisGrants of Plan-Based Awards2011 Equity Incentive Plan.  The Purchase Plan was approved by our Board of Directors in March 2010. Our Board of Directors amended and restated the Purchase Plan in February 2011 to reflect that the Purchase Plan would become
effective in 2011 upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. The Purchase Plan was approved by our stockholders in March 2011 and became effective upon the commencement of the MagnaChip IPO. We initially authorized and reserved 789,890 shares for
sale under the Purchase Plan. In August, 2012, the Committee suspended the Purchase Plan.  As of December 31, 2015,
1,163,880 shares of our common stock remained reserved for sale under the Purchase Plan. In addition, the Purchase Plan provides for an automatic annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan on January 1 of each
year beginning in 2012 and continuing through and including January 1, 2021 equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, (ii) 789,980 shares, or
(iii) a number of shares as our Board of Directors may determine. Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and in outstanding purchase rights to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants rights in the
event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to purchase rights which expire or are canceled will again become available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Because the Purchase Plan was suspended in August 2012,
no annual increase in the number of shares authorized under such plan occurred on January 1, 2014, on January 1, 2015 or on January 1, 2016. For more information on our 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see Compensation
Discussion and AnalysisGrants of Plan-Based Awards2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  Under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, all conflicts of interest and related party transactions involving our directors or executive officers must be reviewed and approved in writing by our full
Board of Directors. In the approval process, the approving authority will review all aspects of the conflict of interest or related party transaction, including but not limited to: (i) compliance with laws, rules and regulations; (ii) the
adverse effect on our business and results of operations; (iii) the adverse effect on our relationships with third parties such as customers, vendors and potential investors; (iv) the benefit to the director, officer or employee at issue;

Registration Rights Agreement  On November 9, 2009, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the holders of MagnaChip Semiconductor LLCs common units issued in our reorganization proceedings, including Avenue,
where we granted them registration rights with respect to our common stock. In 2012 and 2013, the Company paid fees and expenses of $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in connection with the registration and sale of shares of our common
stock by Avenue pursuant to such registration rights agreement. Affiliates of Avenue currently have one employee, Mr. Klein, serving as a member of our Board of Directors. Mr. Elkins, also a current member of our Board of Directors, was
previously employed by affiliates of Avenue until December 31, 2012, and served as a consultant to affiliates of Avenue.

officers; and (4) all of the members of our Board of Directors and executive officers, as a group. The following tables list the number of shares and percentage of shares beneficially owned based on 34,731,754 shares of common stock outstanding
as of June 15, 2016.  The amounts and percentages of equity interests beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC
regulations governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to
vote or to direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that
person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the securities as to
which he or she has no economic interest.  Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole
voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each person listed in the table below is c/o MagnaChip Semiconductor, Ltd., 215 Daesin-ro,

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Companys executive officers and directors, and persons who own

PROPOSAL TWO 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR  Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers has been selected by the Audit Committee as the principal independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year for us and our subsidiaries. Our Board of
Directors recommends a vote for ratification of the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books and accounts for us and our subsidiaries for the current fiscal year. It is
expected that representatives of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers will attend the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and, if a representative is in attendance, the representative will be available to answer
appropriate questions.  The appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accounting firm
is not required to be submitted to a vote of our stockholders for ratification. However, our Board believes that obtaining stockholder ratification is a sound governance practice. If our stockholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the
appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Audit Committee will take such actions as it deems necessary as a result of such stockholder vote.  Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The following table presents fees billed or expected to be billed for professional services rendered by Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers and its affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Policy and procedure for approval of audit and permitted non-audit services 
All audit fees were pre-approved by the Companys Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by Samil
PricewaterhouseCoopers and its affiliates was compatible with the maintenance of that firms independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. With respect to outside auditor independence, the Audit Committee Charter provides for
pre-approval of audit services and non-audit services, based on independence, qualifications and, if applicable, performance, and approve the fees and other terms of any such engagement. The Audit Committee Charter authorizes the Audit Committee to
delegate to one or more of its members the authority to grant pre-approvals for such services, provided that the decisions of such member(s) to grant any such pre-approval shall be presented to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit
Committee followed these guidelines in approving all services rendered by Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers and its affiliates. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers as
our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year.
