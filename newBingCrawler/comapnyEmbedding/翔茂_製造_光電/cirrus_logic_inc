History[edit]
Patil Systems, Inc., was founded in Salt Lake City in 1981 by Dr. Suhas Patil, in 1983 the company was reorganized by Dr. Patil, Kamran Elahian, and venture capitalist Fred Nazem, whose firm, Nazem and Company provided the company's first/start-up round of financing. Later the company was renamed as Cirrus Logic when it moved to Silicon Valley in 1984 to focus on solutions for the growing PC components market. Michael Hackworth was named president and chief executive officer in January 1985, and served as CEO until February 1999. It joined the Nasdaq market listing in 1989 (symbol: CRUS). Cirrus Logic acquired Crystal Semiconductor, a supplier of analog and mixed-signal converter ICs, in 1991. In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic became a supplier of PC graphics chips, audio converters and chips for magnetic storage products. David D. French joined Cirrus Logic, Inc., as president and chief operating officer in June 1998 and was named chief executive officer in February 1999. Soon after joining the company, through an acquisition strategy Mr. French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high-performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards, Mr. M. Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing, contributing further to its success. The company announced in April 2000 that it had completed moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas.[4] In June 2005, Cirrus Logic sold its video products operation to an investment firm, creating privately owned Magnum Semiconductor. After French resigned in March 2007, Jason Rhode, formerly the vice president and general manager of Cirrus Logic's Mixed Signal Audio Division, was named president and CEO in May 2007. Today, Cirrus Logic is focused on its high-precision technologies for digital signal processing components for audio and energy markets. In 2014 Cirrus Logic bought Wolfson Microelectronics for £291 million.

Graphics history[edit]
In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic was a supplier of low-cost PC graphics chips. Cirrus' Microsoft Windows 2D GUI accelerators (GDI) were among the fastest in the low-end market-segment, outperforming competing VGA-chips from Oak Technologies, Trident Microsystems, and Paradise (Western Digital). For example, the Cirrus GD5422 (1992) supported hardware acceleration for both 8-bit color and 16-bit color. It was one of the lowest-priced SVGA controllers to support both.
By the mid-1990s, when PC's had migrated to the PCI bus, Cirrus had fallen behind S3 and Trident Microsystems. When the announced release date of the GD5470 "Mondello" came and went, Cirrus's reputation in desktop PC-graphics suffered. Mondello development took a back seat to the GD5464 which was near completion and proved to be a much faster design with the use of Rambus. (Because of this Mondello never got off the ground)
The company's final graphics chips, the GD546x "Laguna" series of PCI/AGP 3D-accelerators, were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM. The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, single-pass lighting, gouraud shading, and alpha blending, was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block. The raw processing power of the GD546x was nearly 2.5 million 25 pixel triangles per second, much faster than competitors.
When Intel announced they were entering the 3D market with the i740 Cirrus Logic exited the market, which at the time for Cirrus Logic was worth 500 million dollars annually. (Intel didn't catch up in performance for many years, the i740 was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs).
Emulated Cirrus Logic graphic cards are used in emulators. QEMU emulate the Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA-card, which is also emulated by Bochs (which in addition also emulates the CL-GD5430 ISA card).

DisclaimerNOTE: ELECTRONIC VERSIONS OF THE MATERIAL YOU ARE SEEKING ACCESS TO ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE ON THIS WEB PAGE BY CIRRUS LOGIC IN GOOD FAITH. THESE MATERIALS ARE NOT DIRECTED AT OR ACCESSIBLE BY PERSONS LOCATED IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE THE RELEVANT ACTION WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION OR WOULD RESULT IN A REQUIREMENT TO COMPLY WITH ANY GOVERNMENTAL OR OTHER CONSENT OR ANY REGISTRATION, FILING OR OTHER FORMALITY WHICH CIRRUS LOGIC REGARDS AS UNDULY ONEROUS (“Restricted Jurisdiction”). 
The Acquisition relates to the shares of a Scottish company and is proposed to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the laws of the United Kingdom.  Neither the proxy solicitation rules nor (unless implemented by means of a Takeover Offer) the tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will apply to the Acquisition. Moreover, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom and under the City Code to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements of the US proxy solicitation rules and tender offer rules.  If Cirrus Logic exercises its right to implement the Acquisition of the Wolfson Microelectronics Shares by way of a Takeover Offer, the Takeover Offer will be made in compliance with applicable US securities laws and regulations.
If you would like information on the Acquisition please read this notice carefully - it applies to all persons who view this Web Page and, depending on where you live, it may affect your rights.

Basis of accessThe information on this Web Page about the Acquisition is made available in good faith and does not constitute an offer to sell or otherwise dispose of, or an invitation or solicitation of, any offer to purchase or subscribe for any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. 
This notice may be altered or updated. You should read it in full each time you access the Web Page.

Forward-looking statements 
The information on this Web Page, including information included or incorporated by reference, contains a number of statements that are or may be forward-looking statements relating to Cirrus Logic and Wolfson Microelectronics. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Cirrus Logic and Wolfson Microelectronics about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements contained on this Web Page include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Cirrus Logic and Wolfson Microelectronics, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. All statements other than statements of historical facts included on this Web Page may be forward looking statements. Without limitation, any statements preceded or followed by or that include the words “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “expects”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “may”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “synergy”, “cost-saving”, “projects”, “goal”, “strategy”, “budget”, “forecast” or “might”, or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Cirrus Logic’s or Wolfson Microelectronics’ operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; and (iii) the effects of government regulation on Cirrus Logic’s or Wolfson Microelectronics’ business.
The forward looking statements are not guarantees of future financial performance. Except as expressly provided on this Web Page, they have not been reviewed by the auditors of Cirrus Logic or Wolfson Microelectronics or their respective financial advisers. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results and are based on certain key assumptions. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward looking statements. These factors include the satisfaction of conditions, as well as additional factors, such as: fluctuations in the capital markets; fluctuations in interest and exchange rates; increased regulation or regulatory scrutiny; the occurrence of unforeseen disasters or catastrophes; political or economic instability in principal markets; adverse outcomes in litigation; and general, local and global economic, political, business and market conditions. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither Cirrus Logic nor Wolfson Microelectronics, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements on this Web Page will actually occur. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. All subsequent oral or written forward looking statements attributable to Cirrus Logic or Wolfson Microelectronics or any of their respective members, directors, officers or employees or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Cirrus Logic and Wolfson Microelectronics disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking or other statements contained on this Web Page other than in accordance with their legal and regulatory obligations.
Forward-looking statements only speak as of the date on which they are made, and the events discussed on this Web Page may not occur. Cirrus Logic does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation.

Use of non-GAAP Financial Information


To supplement Cirrus Logic's financial statements presented on a GAAP

      non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income,
      operating expenses, gross margins, tax expenses and tax expense impact
      on earnings per share. A reconciliation of the adjustments to GAAP
      results is included in the tables below. Non-GAAP financial information
      is not meant as a substitute for GAAP results, but is included because
      management believes such information is useful to our investors for
      informational and comparative purposes. In addition, certain non-GAAP
      financial information is used internally by management to evaluate and
      manage the company. The non-GAAP financial information used by Cirrus
      Logic may differ from that used by other companies. These
      non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a
      substitute for, the results prepared in accordance with GAAP.


Safe Harbor Statement


Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set
      forth in this news release contain forward-looking statements including
      our estimates of second quarter fiscal year 2018 revenue, gross margin,
      combined research and development and selling, general and
      administrative expense levels, share-based compensation expense and
      amortization of acquired intangibles. In some cases, forward-looking
      statements are identified by words such as “expect,” “anticipate,”
      “target,” “project,” “believe,” “goals,” “opportunity,” “estimates,”
      “intend,” and variations of these types of words and similar expressions.
In addition, any statements that refer to our plans, expectations,
      strategies or other characterizations of future events or circumstances
      are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
      are based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions and are
      subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
      results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but
      are not limited to, the following: the level of orders and shipments
      during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, customer cancellations of
      orders, or the failure to place orders consistent with forecasts, along
      with the timing and success of new product ramps; and the risk factors
      listed in our Form 10-K for the year ended March 25, 2017 and in our
      other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are
      available at www.sec.gov.
      The foregoing information concerning our business outlook represents our
      outlook as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no

Non-GAAP financial information is not meant as a substitute for
            GAAP results, but is included because management believes such
            information is useful to our investors for informational and
            comparative purposes. In addition, certain non-GAAP financial
            information is used internally by management to evaluate and
            manage the company. As a note, the non-GAAP financial information
            used by Cirrus Logic may differ from that used by other companies.
            These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and
            not as a substitute for, the results prepared in accordance with
            GAAP.
