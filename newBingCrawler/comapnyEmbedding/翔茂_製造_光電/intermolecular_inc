Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $(0.6) million, or $(0.01) per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $(1.6) million, or $(0.3) per share in the prior quarter, and a $(5.1) million or $(0.11) per share loss in the first quarter of 2015.  
"The company has made great progress in growing revenue and heading towards profitability. With $14.5 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we achieved over 40% growth from the first quarter of 2015," said Bruce McWilliams, CEO of Intermolecular.  "We are demonstrating that being a trusted partner for advanced materials innovation can be a scalable and profitable business."
Outlook for Second Quarter 2016
The following statements are based on current expectations for the second quarter of 2016. The Company does not plan to update, nor does it undertake any obligation to update, this outlook in the future.

Intermolecular projects revenue in the range of $12.0 million to $12.5 million. 
Non-GAAP net loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, is projected between $(2.6) million and $(3.6) million, or between $(0.05) to $(0.07) per share, on approximately 49 million shares outstanding.
Intermolecular reports revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and additionally on a non-GAAP basis.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the financial data presented on a GAAP basis, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and restructuring related charges. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not serve as an alternative to GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other companies. These results should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. We believe that our non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations because the non-GAAP measures exclude charges that management considers to be outside of Intermolecular's core operating results. We believe that 
the non-GAAP measures of revenue, cost of net revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, net (loss) income, earnings per share and net (loss) income per share, viewed in combination with our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective and a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to review and assess financial performance, to determine executive officer incentive compensation and to plan and forecast performance in future periods.
