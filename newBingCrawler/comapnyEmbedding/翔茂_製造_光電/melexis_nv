About this visual





            Some jellyfish have ocelli: light-sensitive organs. The box jellyfish has 24 eyes, two of which are capable of seeing color and four parallel information processing areas, supposedly making it one of the few creatures to have a 360-degree view of its environment. These abilities are very much linked to the unique characteristics of many of our sensors, be it the Triaxis 3D magnetic sensors or the SensorEyeC Light sensors.
