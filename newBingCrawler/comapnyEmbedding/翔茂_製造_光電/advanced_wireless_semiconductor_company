                         In April 1998, factories was planning to be set up and Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Company was registered in Dec. after the approval of Ministry of Economic Affairs, mainly engaging in research, development, production, testing, manufacture and sale of GaAsHBT. According to individual customer needs, it provides assistance to the circuit design, wafer manufacturing, testing and other services. Positioned as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics (UMC) in SiIC industry', Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Company is a professional manufacturer, without involving in its own product design and sales. Purchasing epitaxial wafer from the upstream, it designs and processes GaAsHBT according to the needs of the client. In Jul. 1997, the first 4-inch GaAsHBT was developed. In Jan. 2000 programming of AlGaAs/GaAsHBT was finished. In Jun. the programming technology of InGaP/GaAs was developed. In Sep. programming technology of BacksideVia was developed. In Nov. the above technologies got the ISO-9002 certification. In 2001, the InGaP / GaAs high speed HBT device process technology used in OC-192 (optical fiber) module was developed. In Dec. it launched the new product-InGaP/GaAs chip which got the ISO-14001 certification. In Mar. 2002, it obtained international IDM certification. In May it passed the quality check of major IDM manufacturers for America. In Jul. it went into mass production to become the foundries of American IDM factories. In Oct.the shipment target was achieved and the mass production was successful.
