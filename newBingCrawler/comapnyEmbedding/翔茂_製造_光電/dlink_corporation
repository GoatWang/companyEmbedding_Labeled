History[edit]
D-Link Corporation changed its name from Datex Systems Inc. in 1994, when it went public and when it became the first networking company on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. It is now publicly traded on the TSEC and NSE stock exchanges. It was founded by seven individuals including Ken Kao, the late Chairman of D-Link.[citation needed]
In 2007, it was the leading networking company in the small to medium business (SMB) segment worldwide with 21.9% market share.[2] In March 2008, it became the market leader in Wi-Fi product shipments worldwide, with 33% of the total market.[3] In 2007, the company was featured in the "Info Tech 100", a listing of the world's best IT companies. It was also ranked as the 9th best IT company in the world for shareholder returns by BusinessWeek.[4]
Product range[edit]
D-Link's products are geared towards the networking and communications market. Its business products include switches, surveillance network cameras, firewalls, iSCSI SANs and business wireless, while consumer products cover consumer wireless devices, broadband devices, and the Digital Home devices (which include media players, storage, and surveillance camera/NVR).[citation needed]

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In January 2010, it was reported that HNAP vulnerabilities had been found on some D-Link routers. D-Link was also criticized for their response which was deemed confusing as to which models were affected and downplayed the seriousness of the risk.[5]
In January 2013, version v1.13 for the DIR-100 revA was reported to include a backdoor in the firmware. By passing a specific user agent in an HTTP request to the router, normal authentication is bypassed. It was reported that this backdoor had been present for some time.[6]
Computerworld reported in January 2015 that ZynOS, a firmware used by some D-Link routers (as well as ZTE, TP-Link, and others), are vulnerable to DNS hijacking by an unauthenticated remote attacker, specifically when remote management is enabled.[7]
Later in 2015, it was reported that D-Link leaked the private keys used to sign firmware updates for the DCS-5020L security camera and a variety of other D-Link products. The key expired in September 2015, but had been published online for seven months.[8]
Also in 2015, D-Link was criticized for more HNAP vulnerabilities,[9] and worse, introducing new vulnerabilities in their "fixed" firmware updates.[10]
On January 5, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission sued D-Link for failing to take reasonable steps to secure their routers and IP cameras. As D-Link marketing was misleading customers into believing their products were secure. The complaint also says security gaps could allow hackers to watch and record people on their D-Link cameras without their knowledge, target them for theft, or record private conversations.[11] D-Link has denied these accusations and has enlisted Cause of Action Institute to file a motion against the FTC for their "baseless" charges.[12]
Server misuse[edit]
In 2006, D-Link was accused of NTP vandalism, when it was found that its routers were sending time requests to a small NTP server in Denmark, incurring thousands of dollars of costs to its operator. D-Link initially refused to accept responsibility.[13] Later, D-link products were found also to be abusing other time servers, including some operated by the US military and NASA.[14]
GPL violation[edit]
On September 6, 2006, the gpl-violations.org project prevailed in court litigation against D-Link Germany GmbH regarding D-Link's alleged inappropriate and copyright infringing use of parts of the Linux kernel.[15]

Setup Wizard
						              
If you are new to networking and have never configured a router
						              before, click on Setup Wizard and
						              the router will guide you through a few simple steps to get your
						              network up and running. 
Manual Configure
						              
If you consider yourself an advanced user and have configured a
						              router before, click Manual
						              Configure to input all the settings manually. 






WAN



The WAN (Wide Area Network) section is where you configure your
			            Internet Connection type. 

Internet Connection Type
			              
There are several connection types to choose from: Static IP,
			              DHCP, PPPoE, PPTP, L2TP. If you are unsure of your
			              connection method, please contact your Internet Service Provider.
			              Note: If using the PPPoE option, you will need to ensure that any
			              PPPoE client software on your computers is removed or disabled.
			              

Static WAN Mode
			                Used when your ISP provides you a set IP address that does
			                not change. The IP information is manually entered in your IP
			                configuration settings. You must enter the IP
			                address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, Primary DNS
			                Server, and Secondary DNS
			                Server. Your ISP provides you with all of this
			                information.
			                DHCP WAN Mode
			                A method of connection where the ISP assigns your IP address
			                when your router requests one from the ISP's server. Some ISP's
			                require you to make some settings on your side before your
			                router can connect to the Internet.
			                Host Name: Some ISP's may check
			                your computer's Host Name. The Host Name identifies your system
			                to the ISP's server. This way they know your computer is
			                eligible to receive an IP address. In other words, they know
			                that you are paying for their service. 
Use Unicasting: This option is
			                normally turned off, and should remain off as long as the
			                WAN-side DHCP server correctly provides an IP address to the
			                router. However, if the router cannot obtain an IP address from
			                the DHCP server, the DHCP server may be one that works better
			                with unicast responses. In this case, turn the unicasting option
			                on, and observe whether the router can obtain an IP address. In
			                this mode, the router accepts unicast responses from the DHCP
			                server instead of broadcast responses. 

PPPoE
			                Select this option if your ISP requires you to use a PPPoE
			                (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet) connection. DSL
			                providers typically use this option. This method of connection
			                requires you to enter a Username and
			                Password (provided by your Internet
			                Service Provider) to gain access to the Internet. The supported
			                authentication protocols are PAP and CHAP.
			                Dynamic IP: If the ISP's servers
			                assign the router's IP addressing upon establishing a
			                connection, select this option. 
Static IP: If your ISP has assigned
			                a fixed IP address, select this option. The ISP provides the
			                value for the IP Address. 
Service Name: Some ISP's may
			                require that you enter a Service Name. Only enter a Service Name
			                if your ISP requires one. 
Reconnect Mode: Typically PPPoE
			                connections are not always on. The D-Link router allows you to
			                set the reconnection mode. The settings are: 

Always on: A connection to the
			                  Internet is always maintained.
			                  On demand: A connection to the
			                  Internet is made as needed.
			                  Manual: You have to open up the
			                  Web-based management interface and click the Connect button
			                  manually any time that you wish to connect to the Internet.
			                  
Maximum Idle Time: Time interval
			                the machine can be idle before the PPPoE connection is
			                disconnected. The Maximum Idle Time value is only used for the
			                "On demand" and "Manual" reconnect modes. 
PPTP
			                PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) uses a virtual
			                private network to connect to your ISP. This method of
			                connection is primarily used in Europe. This method of
			                connection requires you to enter a Username and Password (provided by your Internet Service
			                Provider) to gain access to the Internet. The supported
			                authentication protocols are PAP and CHAP.
			                Dynamic IP: If the ISP's servers
			                assign the router's IP addressing upon establishing a
			                connection, select this option. 
Static IP: If your ISP has assigned
			                a fixed IP address, select this option. The ISP provides the
			                values for the following fields: PPTP IP
			                Address, PPTP Subnet Mask , and
			                PPTP Gateway IP Address. 
PPTP Server IP Address: The ISP
			                provides this parameter, if necessary. The value may be the same
			                as the Gateway IP Address. 
Reconnect Mode: Typically PPTP
			                connections are not always on. The D-Link router allows you to
			                set the reconnection mode. The settings are: 

Always on: A connection to the
			                  Internet is always maintained.
			                  On demand: A connection to the
			                  Internet is made as needed.
			                  Manual: You have to open up the
			                  Web-based management interface and click the Connect button
			                  manually any time that you wish to connect to the Internet.
			                  
Maximum Idle Time: Time interval
			                the machine can be idle before the PPTP connection is
			                disconnected. The Maximum Idle Time value is only used for the
			                "On demand" and "Manual" reconnect modes. 
L2TP
			                L2TP (Layer Two Tunneling Protocol) uses a virtual private
			                network to connect to your ISP. This method of connection
			                requires you to enter a Username and
			                Password (provided by your Internet
			                Service Provider) to gain access to the Internet. The supported
			                authentication protocols are PAP and CHAP.
			                Dynamic IP: If the ISP's servers
			                assign the router's IP addressing upon establishing a
			                connection, select this option. 
Static IP: If your ISP has assigned
			                a fixed IP address, select this option. The ISP provides the
			                values for the following fields: L2TP IP
			                Address, L2TP Subnet Mask , and
			                L2TP Gateway IP Address. 
L2TP Server IP Address: The ISP
			                provides this parameter, if necessary. The value may be the same
			                as the Gateway IP Address. 
Reconnect Mode: Typically L2TP
			                connections are not always on. The D-Link router allows you to
			                set the reconnection mode. The settings are: 

Always on: A connection to the
			                  Internet is always maintained.
			                  On demand: A connection to the
			                  Internet is made as needed.
			                  Manual: You have to open up the
			                  Web-based management interface and click the Connect button
			                  manually any time that you wish to connect to the Internet.
			                  
Maximum Idle Time: Time interval
			                the machine can be idle before the L2TP connection is
			                disconnected. The Maximum Idle Time value is used for the "On
			                demand" and "Manual" reconnect modes. 
Advanced DNS Server:
			              
DNS stands for Domain
			              	Name System. The DNS servers act as a phonebook and translate the
			              	human-friendly domain name into its corresponding IP address.
			              	Advanced DNS Services for D-Link is powered by Best Path Networks,
			              	a subsidiary of OpenDNS that provides anti-phishing and DNS services
			              	to partners like D-Link. OpenDNS is the world's largest and fastest-growing
			              	provider of free security and DNS infrastructure services. Advanced DNS
			              	Services makes your online experience safer and your Internet overall
			              	faster and more reliable. 
The DNS platform is designed to not interfere with any specific protocol.
			              	However, a small subset of spam filtering solutions may be confused by receiving
			              	search responses for domains that do not exist. It is recommended that the
			              	enhanced search experience be disabled for clients that operate an on-site mail server.
			              	DNS does not affect upload or download speeds. These are controlled exclusively
			              	by your Internet Service Provider. D-Link and Best Path Networks do not collect or store
			              	any personally identifiable DNS information about Advanced DNS Services users.
Your search results are powered by Yahoo. The search function provides you with a much
			              	more fluid browsing experience. When a site cannot be reached, or a site does not exist,
			              	 we will provide you with search suggestions instead of the generic error message displayed
			              	  by your browser. We also automatically correct some of the common typos users make in the
			              	   address bar. The typo-correction feature only works for top level domains that have been
			              	    misspelled, such .cmo and .ogr. Sometimes you might be mis-directed to the search results
			              	     page. If you clicked on a link in a spam email it is quite possible that the site has
			              	     been disabled for abuse. Because the site no longer exists you may receive our search page.
			              

Primary DNS Server, Secondary DNS Server:
			              Enter the IP addresses of the DNS Servers. Leave the field
			              for the secondary server empty if not used. 
MTU: The Maximum Transmission Unit
			              (MTU) is a parameter that determines the largest packet size (in
			              bytes) that the router will send to the WAN. If LAN devices send
			              larger packets, the router will break them into smaller packets.
			              Ideally, you should set this to match the MTU of the connection to
			              your ISP. Typical values are 1500 bytes for an Ethernet connection
			              and 1492 bytes for a PPPoE connection. If the router's MTU is set
			              too high, packets will be fragmented downstream. If the router's
			              MTU is set too low, the router will fragment packets unnecessarily
			              and in extreme cases may be unable to establish some connections.
			              In either case, network performance can suffer. 
MAC Address: Each networking device
			              has it's own unique MAC address defined by the hardware
			              manufacturer. Some ISP's may check your computer's MAC address.
			              Some ISP's record the MAC address of the network adapter in the
			              computer or router used to initially connect to their service. The
			              ISP will then only grant Internet access to requests from a
			              computer or router with this particular MAC address. This router
			              has a different MAC address than the computer or router that
			              initially connected to the ISP. If you need to change the MAC
			              address of the router's WAN-side Ethernet interface, either type
			              in an alternate MAC address (for example, the MAC address of the
			              router initially connected to the ISP) or copy the MAC address of
			              a PC. To copy the MAC address of the computer that initially
			              connected to the ISP, connect to the D-Link router using that
			              computer and click the Clone Your PC's MAC
			              Address button. The WAN interface will then use the MAC
			              address of the network adapter in your computer.
						





Wireless



The wireless section is used to configure the wireless settings
						            for your D-Link router. Note that changes made in this section may
						            also need to be duplicated on wireless clients that you want to
						            connect to your wireless network. 
To protect your privacy, use the wireless security mode to
						            configure the wireless security features. This device supports three
						            wireless security modes including: WEP, WPA-Personal, and
						            WPA-Enterprise. WEP is the original wireless encryption standard.
						            WPA provides a higher level of security. WPA-Personal does not
						            require an authentication server. The WPA-Enterprise option does
						            require a RADIUS authentication server. 

Enable Wireless
						              This option turns off and on the wireless connection feature
						              of the router. When you set this option, the following parameters
						              are in effect.
						              Wireless Network Name
						              When you are browsing for available wireless networks, this is
						              the name that will appear in the list (unless Visibility Status is
						              set to Invisible, see below). This name is also referred to as the
						              SSID. For security purposes, it is highly recommended to change
						              from the pre-configured network name.
						              Enable Auto Channel Scan
						              If you select this option, the router automatically finds the
						              channel with least interference and uses that channel for wireless
						              networking. If you disable this option, the router uses the
						              channel that you specify with the following Wireless Channel option.
						              Wireless Channel
						              A wireless network uses specific channels in the wireless
						              spectrum to handle communication between clients. Some channels in
						              your area may have interference from other electronic devices.
						              Choose the clearest channel to help optimize the performance and
						              coverage of your wireless network. 
802.11 Mode
						              If all of the wireless devices you want to connect with this
						              router can connect in the same transmission mode, you can improve
						              performance slightly by choosing the appropriate "Only" mode. If
						              you have some devices that use a different transmission mode,
						              choose the appropriate "Mixed" mode.
						              Channel Width
						              The "Auto 20/40 MHz" option is usually best. The other options
						              are available for special circumstances.
						              Visibility Status
						              The Invisible option allows you to hide your wireless network.
						              When this option is set to Visible, your wireless network name is
						              broadcast to anyone within the range of your signal. If you're not
						              using encryption then they could connect to your network. When
						              Invisible mode is enabled, you must enter the Wireless Network
						              Name (SSID) on the client manually to connect to the network.
						              Security Mode
						              Unless one of these encryption modes is selected, wireless
						              transmissions to and from your wireless network can be easily
						              intercepted and interpreted by unauthorized users.
						              WEP
						              
A method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended
						              to provide the same level of privacy as a wired network. WEP is
						              not as secure as WPA encryption. To gain access to a WEP network,
						              you must know the key. The key is a string of characters that you
						              create. When using WEP, you must determine the level of
						              encryption. The type of encryption determines the key length.
						              128-bit encryption requires a longer key than 64-bit encryption.
						              Keys are defined by entering in a string in HEX (hexadecimal -
						              using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for
						              Information Interchange - alphanumeric characters) format. ASCII
						              format is provided so you can enter a string that is easier to
						              remember. The ASCII string is converted to HEX for use over the
						              network. Four keys can be defined so that you can change keys
						              easily. A default key is selected for use on the network. 


Example:
						                64-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 10 characters in length.
						                (12345678FA is a valid string of 10 characters for 64-bit
						                encryption.)
						                128-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 26 characters in
						                length. (456FBCDF123400122225271730 is a valid string of 26
						                characters for 128-bit encryption.)
						                64-bit ASCII keys are up to 5 characters in length (DMODE is
						                a valid string of 5 characters for 64-bit encryption.)
						                128-bit ASCII keys are up to 13 characters in length
						                (2002HALOSWIN1 is a valid string of 13 characters for 128-bit
						                encryption.) 
Note that, if you enter fewer characters in the WEP key than
						              required, the remainder of the key is automatically padded with
						              zeros. 
WPA-Personal and WPA-Enterprise
						              
Both of these options select some variant of Wi-Fi Protected
						              Access (WPA) -- security standards published by the Wi-Fi
						              Alliance. The WPA Mode further refines
						              the variant that the router should employ. 
WPA Mode: WPA is the older standard;
						              select this option if the clients that will be used with the
						              router only support the older standard. WPA2 is the newer
						              implementation of the stronger IEEE 802.11i security standard.
						              With the "WPA2" option, the router tries WPA2 first, but falls
						              back to WPA if the client only supports WPA. With the "WPA2 Only"
						              option, the router associates only with clients that also support
						              WPA2 security. 
Group Key Update Interval: The amount
						              of time before the group key used for broadcast and multicast data
						              is changed. 
WPA-Personal
						              
This option uses Wi-Fi Protected Access with a Pre-Shared Key
						              (PSK). 
Pre-Shared Key: The key is entered as
						              a pass-phrase of up to 63 alphanumeric characters in ASCII
						              (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) format at
						              both ends of the wireless connection. It cannot be shorter than
						              eight characters, although for proper security it needs to be of
						              ample length and should not be a commonly known phrase. This
						              phrase is used to generate session keys that are unique for each
						              wireless client.

						                Wireless Networking technology enables ubiquitous
						                communication 
WPA-Enterprise
						              
This option works with a RADIUS Server to authenticate wireless
						              clients. Wireless clients should have established the necessary
						              credentials before attempting to authenticate to the Server
						              through this Gateway. Furthermore, it may be necessary to
						              configure the RADIUS Server to allow this Gateway to authenticate
						              users. 
Authentication Timeout: Amount of
						              time before a client will be required to re-authenticate. 
RADIUS Server IP Address: The IP
						              address of the authentication server. 
RADIUS Server Port: The port number
						              used to connect to the authentication server. 
RADIUS Server Shared Secret: A
						              pass-phrase that must match with the authentication server. 
MAC Address Authentication: If this
						              is selected, the user must connect from the same computer whenever
						              logging into the wireless network. 
Advanced: 

Optional Backup RADIUS Server
						                This option enables configuration of an optional second
						                RADIUS server. A second RADIUS server can be used as backup for
						                the primary RADIUS server. The second RADIUS server is consulted
						                only when the primary server is not available or not responding.
						                The fields Second RADIUS Server IP
						                Address, RADIUS Server Port,

Network Settings




Router Settings
					              These are the settings of the LAN (Local Area Network)
					              interface for the router. The router's local network (LAN)
					              settings are configured based on the IP Address and Subnet Mask
					              assigned in this section. The IP address is also used to access
					              this Web-based management interface. It is recommended that you
					              use the default settings if you do not have an existing network.
					              
IP Address
					                The IP address of your router on the local area network.
					                Your local area network settings are based on the address
					                assigned here. For example, 192.168.0.1.
					                Subnet Mask
					                The subnet mask of your router on the local area network.
					                Device Name
					                Device Name allows you to configure this device easily when your network using TCP/IP protocol.
							You can enter the device name of the router, instead of IP address, into your web browser to access for configuration.
							Recommend to change the device name if there's more than on D-Link devices within the subnet.
					                Local Domain Name
					                This entry is optional. Enter a domain name for the local
					                network. The AP's DHCP server will give this domain name to the
					                computers on the wireless LAN. So, for example, if you enter
					                mynetwork.net here, and you have a wireless laptop
					                with a name of chris, that laptop will be known as
					                chris.mynetwork.net. Note, however, if the AP's
					                settings specify "DHCP (Dynamic)" Address, and the router's DHCP
					                server assigns a domain name to the AP, that domain name will
					                override any name you enter here.
					                DNS Relay
					                When DNS Relay is enabled, the router plays the role of a
					                DNS server. DNS requests sent to the router are forwarded to the
					                ISP's DNS server. This provides a constant DNS address that LAN
					                computers can use, even when the router obtains a different DNS
					                server address from the ISP upon re-establishing the WAN
					                connection. You should disable DNS relay if you implement a
					                LAN-side DNS server as a virtual server. 
DHCP Server Settings
					              
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. The DHCP
					              section is where you configure the built-in DHCP Server to assign
					              IP addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area
					              network (LAN). 

Enable DHCP Server
					                
Once your D-Link router is properly configured and this
					                option is enabled, the DHCP Server will manage the IP addresses
					                and other network configuration information for computers and
					                other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no
					                need for you to do this yourself. 
The computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also
					                need to have their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCP" or "Obtain
					                an IP address automatically". 
When you set Enable DHCP Server,
					                the following options are displayed. 
DHCP IP Address Range
					                These two IP values (from and to) define a
					                range of IP addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning
					                addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network.
					                Any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by
					                the DHCP Server; these could, therefore, be used for manually
					                configured devices or devices that cannot use DHCP to obtain
					                network address details automatically.
					                It is possible for a computer or device that is manually
					                configured to have an address that does reside within this
					                range. In this case the address should be reserved (see DHCP
					                Reservation below), so that the DHCP Server knows that this
					                specific address can only be used by a specific computer or
					                device. 
Your D-Link router, by default, has a static IP address of
					                192.168.0.1. This means that addresses 192.168.0.2 to
					                192.168.0.254 can be made available for allocation by the DHCP
					                Server. 


Example:
					                  Your D-Link router uses 192.168.0.1 for the IP address.
					                  You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web
					                  server with a static IP address of 192.168.0.3. You've
					                  assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP
					                  server with a static IP address of 192.168.0.4. Therefore the
					                  starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be
					                  192.168.0.5 or greater.
					                  Example:
					                  Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses
					                  From 192.168.0.100 To 192.168.0.199. This means that
					                  192.168.0.3 to 192.168.0.99 and 192.168.0.200 to 192.168.0.254
					                  are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that
					                  use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured.
					                  Suppose you have a web server computer that has a manually
					                  configured address of 192.168.0.100. Because this falls within
					                  the "managed range" be sure to create a reservation for this
					                  address and match it to the relevant computer (see Static
					                  DHCP Client below). 
DHCP Lease Time
					                The amount of time that a computer may have an IP address
					                before it is required to renew the lease. The lease functions
					                just as a lease on an apartment would. The initial lease
					                designates the amount of time before the lease expires. If the
					                tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired
					                then a new lease is established. If the lease expires and the
					                address is no longer needed than another tenant may use the
					                address.
					                Always Broadcast
					                If all the computers on the LAN successfully obtain their IP
					                addresses from the router's DHCP server as expected, this option
					                can remain disabled. However, if one of the computers on the LAN
					                fails to obtain an IP address from the router's DHCP server, it
					                may have an old DHCP client that incorrectly turns off the
					                broadcast flag of DHCP packets. Enabling this option will cause
					                the router to always broadcast its responses to all clients,
					                thereby working around the problem, at the cost of increased
					                broadcast traffic on the LAN.
					                NetBIOS Advertisement
					                Check this box to allow the DHCP Server to offer NetBIOS
					                configuration settings to the LAN hosts. NetBIOS allow LAN hosts
					                to discover all other computers within the network, e.g. within
					                Network Neighbourhood.
					                Learn NetBIOS information from WAN
					                If NetBIOS advertisement is swicthed on, switching this
					                setting on causes WINS information to be learned from the WAN
					                side, if available. Turn this setting off to configure manually.

					                Primary WINS Server IP address
					                Configure the IP address of the preferred WINS server. WINS
					                Servers store information regarding network hosts, allowing
					                hosts to 'register' themselves as well as discover other
					                available hosts, e.g. for use in Network Neighbourhood. This
					                setting has no effect if the 'Learn NetBIOS information from
					                WAN' is activated.
					                Secondary WINS Server IP address
					                Configure the IP address of the backup WINS server, if any.
					                This setting has no effect if the 'Learn NetBIOS information
					                from WAN' is activated.
					                NetBIOS Scope
					                This is an advanced setting and is normally left blank. This
					                allows the configuration of a NetBIOS 'domain' name under which
					                network hosts operate. This setting has no effect if the 'Learn
					                NetBIOS information from WAN' is activated.
					                NetBIOS Registration mode
					                Indicates how network hosts are to perform NetBIOS name
					                registration and discovery.H-Node, this indicates a
					                Hybrid-State of operation. First WINS servers are tried, if any,
					                followed by local network broadcast. This is generally the
					                preferred mode if you have configured WINS servers.M-Node
					                (default), this indicates a Mixed-Mode of operation. First
					                Broadcast operation is performed to register hosts and discover
					                other hosts, if broadcast operation fails, WINS servers are
					                tried, if any. This mode favours broadcast operation which may
					                be preferred if WINS servers are reachable by a slow network
					                link and the majority of network services such as servers and
					                printers are local to the LAN.P-Node, this indicates to use
					                WINS servers ONLY. This setting is useful to force all NetBIOS
					                operation to the configured WINS servers. You must have
					                configured at least the primary WINS server IP to point to a
					                working WINS server.B-Node, this indicates to use local
					                network broadcast ONLY. This setting is useful where there are
					                no WINS servers available, however, it is preferred you try
					                M-Node operation first.This setting has no effect if the
					                'Learn NetBIOS information from WAN' is activated.
Add/Edit DHCP
					              Reservation

This option lets you reserve IP addresses, and assign the same
					              IP address to the network device with the specified MAC address
					              any time it requests an IP address. This is almost the same as
					              when a device has a static IP address except that the device must
					              still request an IP address from the D-Link router. The D-Link
					              router will provide the device the same IP address every time.
					              DHCP Reservations are helpful for server computers on the local
					              network that are hosting applications such as Web and FTP. Servers
					              on your network should either use a static IP address or use this
					              option. 

Computer Name
					                
You can assign a name for each computer that is given a
					                reserved IP address. This may help you keep track of which
					                computers are assigned this way. Example: Game
					                Server. 
IP Address:
					                The LAN address that you want to reserve.
					                MAC Address
					                
To input the MAC address of your system, enter it in manually
					                or connect to the D-Link router's Web-Management interface from
					                the system and click the Copy Your PC's
					                MAC Address button. 
A MAC address is usually located on a sticker on the bottom
					                of a network device. The MAC address is comprised of twelve
					                digits. Each pair of hexadecimal digits are usually separated by
					                dashes or colons such as 00-0D-88-11-22-33 or 00:0D:88:11:22:33.
					                If your network device is a computer and the network card is
					                already located inside the computer, you can connect to the
					                D-Link router from the computer and click the Copy Your PC's MAC Address button to
					                enter the MAC address. 
As an alternative, you can locate a MAC address in a specific
					                operating system by following the steps below: 



Windows 98 Windows Me 
Go to the Start menu, select Run, type in
					                      winipcfg, and hit Enter. A popup window will
					                      be displayed. Select the appropriate adapter from the
					                      pull-down menu and you will see the Adapter Address. This
					                      is the MAC address of the device. 

Windows 2000 Windows XP 
Go to your Start menu, select Programs, select
					                      Accessories, and select Command Prompt. At the command
					                      prompt type ipconfig /all and hit Enter. The
					                      physical address displayed for the adapter connecting to
					                      the router is the MAC address. 

Mac OS X 
Go to the Apple Menu, select System Preferences,
					                      select Network, and select the Ethernet Adapter connecting
					                      to the D-Link router. Select the Ethernet button and the
					                      Ethernet ID will be listed. This is the same as the MAC
					                      address. 
DHCP Reservations List
					              This shows clients that you have specified to have reserved
					              DHCP addresses. An entry can be changed by clicking the Edit icon,
					              or deleted by clicking the Delete icon. When you click the Edit
					              icon, the item is highlighted, and the "Edit DHCP Reservation"
					              section is activated for editing.
					              Number of Dynamic DHCP Clients
					              
In this section you can see what LAN devices are currently
					              leasing IP addresses. 

Revoke
					                The Revoke option is available for the
					                situation in which the lease table becomes full or nearly full,
					                you need to recover space in the table for new entries, and you
					                know that some of the currently allocated leases are no longer
					                needed. Clicking Revoke cancels the lease for a
					                specific LAN device and frees an entry in the lease table. Do
					                this only if the device no longer needs the leased IP address,
					                because, for example, it has been removed from the network.
					                Reserve
					                The Reserve option converts this dynamic IP
					                allocation into a DHCP Reservation and adds the corresponding
					                entry to the DHCP Reservations List. 





Usb Settings




Shareport
					              Select to share a USB printer, scanner, or storage device connected to the USB port behind the router with multiple users within your network.
					              
Support
					                Device drivers and the D-Link USB Network Utility must be installed on each computer that will use the device.
					              

WCN Configuration
					              
Select to configure your wireless network using Windows Connect Now (WCN). WCN allows you to copy your wireless settings from the router to a USB flash drive and use to automatically configure the wireless settings on your computer(s) or other WCN-compatible devices.
