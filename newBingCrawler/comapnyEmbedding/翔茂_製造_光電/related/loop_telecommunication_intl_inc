Power Utilities
Global energy demand is growing, society's conscioussness of greenhouse emissions is high, and climate changes can strain energy networks especially in hot summer months. The power industry has responded to these challenges with the development of a smart grid, a telecommunications infrastructure parallel to the power infrastructure. Loop Telecom devices help power companies build this communication network, allowing more...

Oil, Gas, & Petroleum
As large companies grow, they increasingly need more dedicated internal infrastructure to communicate with their machines across large factories and between remote sites. Loop Telecom products such as the IP6820 are suited for these difficult environments -- Several GbE ports for high speed data transfer between data-hungry devices and industial casing to survive harsh temperatures. Our devices allow you to connect all of...

Enterprises & Offices
While not as physically demanding as large factories, offices require strong communication networks as well. Many companies seek better ways to organize their traffic and this is where the IP6510-LN and the IP6610 can help. Our devices can add VLAN tags to direct traffic. They can also aggregate company leased lines for more efficient use. Video surveillance and alarm monitoring, applicable both to white and blue collar w...

Public Transportation
In many ways, a telecommunications network often mirrors a physical transportation network -- thus the old phrase "information superhighway" used to refer to the internet. However, physical transportation networks such as roadways and railways often require their own separate communication network to relay alarm and status information to human operators. Loop Telecom provides the total solution for transmission equipment ...

TDM over Ethernet
The move from a TDM (time division multiplexing) based network to an Ethernet or IP-based packet switched network is one that is both gradual and necessary in order to improve performance and keep costs down. However, this switch is being approached different ways depending on if the customer is a telecom carrier, utility, financial institution, or other industry. In all cases, legacy devices still need to be supported. L...

Key FeaturesLoop-IP6700 TDMoEthernet is used to transport TDM traffic over IP network, in addition to Ethernet traffic.  As the core communications network migrates from TDM to IP, the Loop-IP6700 provides a flexible and cost effective choice for the transport of legacy TDM signals.On the WAN side, the Ethernet interface can be 10/100M electric or optical Ethernet.  On the tributary side, the TDM ports can be multiple E1, T1, and DTE, or single E3/DS3, each with timing preserved.  The Ethernet port can be 10/100 BaseT. The Loop-IP6700 has built-in AC or DC power. Management choices include console port, Ethernet port, and SNMP port, in addition to Inband management for communication with remote management centers.
