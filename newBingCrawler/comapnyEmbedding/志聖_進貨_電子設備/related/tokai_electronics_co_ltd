Electronics
We're making various kind of electronic systems using our electronic controllers and sensors.


Power Supply ECU



This device is used to control the power source of a vehicle. In a vehicle that uses a conventional key, this is done by a driver inserting and turning the key. However, this device enables a vehicle equipped with a smart entry & start system to start up with a push of a button.










Immobilizer ECU



This product prevents a car thief from stealing a vehicle with a duplicated key. The immobilizer ECU compares the ID registered in the vehicle with the electronic ID incorporated in a key and decides whether to allow the engine to start or not. We realized miniaturization by adopting in-house made custom IC and using a Surface Mounted Technology Connector.










Motor Rotation Sensor for Electromagnetic



This magnetic sensor which is constructed from in-house made Magnet-Resistive Element (MRE) and IC makes it possible to control the motor.










Speed Sensor



This magnetic sensor which is constructed from in-house made Magnet-Resistive Element (MRE) and IC makes it possible to check the vehicle speed.










Steering Angle Sensor



This device detects the steering angle of the steering wheel and sends a signal to the vehicle control systems.










Custom IC



We have developed and are manufacturing a semiconductor for vehicles which is highly reliable in regards to vibration, a wide range of temperatures and high humidity.
