		for the
		
			fiscal
		
		year ending
		March of 2017.

			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 4.5%
		
		 versus 2016, when the company's sales were ¥145.42 billion.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 20.5% decline
		in Device Business, from ¥136.72 billion to ¥108.70 billion.
		.
