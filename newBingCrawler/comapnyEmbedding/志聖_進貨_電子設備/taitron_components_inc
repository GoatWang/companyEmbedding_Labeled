TAITRON
                "The
                Discrete Superstore"
        
                

We are a national distributor of brand name electronic components and supplier of original designed and manufactured (“ODM”) electronic components (“ODM Components”), with our product offerings ranging from discrete
semiconductors through small electronic devices.  We also offer value-added engineering and turn-key services, focusing on providing contract electronic manufacturers (“CEM”s) and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”s) with
ODM services for their multi-year turn-key projects.  We maintain two divisions in Taiwan and China.

We have developed a reputation for stocking a large selection of inventories and having an in-depth knowledge of the products in our markets.  Our “superstore” strategy consists of carrying a large quantity and variety of components in inventory to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers.  To differentiate from other distributors, we also offer ODM Components, which are manufactured electronic components based on our own engineering specifications under the private label brand “TCI” through manufacturing partners.  Our Taiwan and China locations provide support for inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our ODM Components and ODM Products.  Our China location also serves as the engineering center responsible for making component datasheets and test specifications, arranging pre-production and mass production at our manufacturer partners, preparing samples, monitoring the quality of shipments, performing failure analysis reports, and designing circuits with partners for ODM projects.

					Full Description



Taitron Components Incorporated (Taitron), incorporated on December 1, 1989, is a distributor of electronic components and supplier of original designed and manufactured (ODM) electronic components (ODM Components). The Company is engaged in the business of providing distribution and services for electronic components. The Company's product offerings range from discrete semiconductors to electronic devices. The Company also offers engineering and services, focusing on providing contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with ODM services for their projects (ODM Projects).The Company offers ODM Components under the private label brand TCI through manufacturing partners. The Company's Taiwan and China locations provide support for inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of its ODM Components and ODM Projects. The Company's China location also serves as the engineering center responsible for making component datasheets and test specifications, arranging pre-production and mass production at its manufacturer partners, preparing samples, monitoring the quality of shipments, performing failure analysis reports, and designing circuits with partners for ODM projects.The Company's products include Rectifiers, Diodes, Transistors, Optoelectronic Devices and Passive Components. Rectifiers are utilized in power supply and other high power applications to convert alternating current to direct current. The Company sells a range of rectifiers, including silicon rectifiers, fast efficient rectifiers, Schottky rectifiers, glass passivated rectifiers, fast efficient glass passivated rectifiers, silicon bridge rectifiers, fast recovery, glass passivated bridge rectifiers and controlled avalanche bridge rectifiers. Diodes are two-lead semiconductors that only allow electric current to flow in one direction. They are used in a range of electronic applications, including signal processing and direction of current. Diodes sold by the Company include switching diodes, varistors, germanium diodes and zener diodes. The Transistors are used in, among other applications, the processing or amplification of electric current and electronic signals, including data, television, sound and power. The Company sells transistors, including small signal transistors, power transistors and power Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFETS).The Company's Optoelectronic devices are solid state products, which provide light displays, such as light-emitting diode (LEDs), optical links and fiber-optic signal coupling. Its applications vary from digital displays on consumer video equipment to fiber optic transmission of computer signals to pattern sensing for regulation, such as those found in automobile cruise controls. The Passive components are a type of electronic component manufactured with non-semiconductor materials. The Passive components, such as resistors, capacitors and inductors are used in electronic circuitry. Passive components are basic electronic components found in electronic products. The Company's ODM Projects are marketed in specific industries, such as wild animal feeders, timers for Direct Current (DC) motor, public street light controllers, LED modules for swimming pools and water fountain lights, LED headlamps for vacuum cleaners, battery testers, universal remote control devices and battery chargers.
