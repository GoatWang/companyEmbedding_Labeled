History[edit]
The company was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds under the name of A.C. Farnell Limited.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966.[4] The company was located next to the Wetherby railway station: as it grew it moved into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and then in 1995, into offices in Armley.[5]
In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components.[6] As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year.[4] In 1996 it went on to buy the Premier Industrial Corporation, a leading United States distributor,[7] and in doing so changed its name to Premier Farnell.[4]
In 2001 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Buck & Hickman,[8] a company which it subsequently went on to sell in 2007.[9] Premier Farnell announced in 2006 the completed sale of Kent, its specialist automotive consumables business.[10]
The company underwent significant change in the mid-2000s, developing from a catalogues and trade counter business into an e-commerce operation, under the direction of Harriet Green, CEO, who joined the business in 2006.[11][12]
In 2007 the group launched its Greater China business, Premier Electronics, with the opening of a new warehouse and distribution centre in WaiGaoQiao.[13]
Towards the end of 2008 Premier Farnell began the closure of Cadillac Electric (part of the group's Industrial Products Division).[14] During the course of 2008 Premier Farnell also acquired Hynetic Electronics,[15] an Indian distributor, and in early 2009 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Microdis Electronics, an electronics distributor based in Poland.[16]
On 24 September 2009, it announced the acquisition of CadSoft Computer GmbH, developer of EAGLE electronic design automation software,[17] which it later sold in 2016.[18]
On 17 March 2016, Premier Farnell sold its Akron Brass subsidiary to IDEX Corporation for $224.2 million.[19]
On 17 October 2016, Avnet completed its acquisition of Premier Farnell in a deal valued at approximately £691 million.[3]

Avnet Completes the Acquisition of Premier Farnell plc


Significantly Expands Customer Base and Digital Footprint Worldwide

 PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Avnet,

      Inc. (NYSE: AVT)

      announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Premier Farnell

      plc ("Premier Farnell") in an all cash merger for £1.85 per share, which

      equates to an equity value of approximately £691 million. The

      acquisition was approved by Premier Farnell shareholders representing

      99.9% of the votes cast and has received all regulatory approvals. The

      transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings and,

      once the integration is complete, expects to generate annual synergies

      of approximately $70 million to $80 million.

    


      "The combination of Premier Farnell with Avnet's components business

      will create a truly unique distribution model that supports customers at

      every stage of the product lifecycle. By pairing our deep expertise in

      large volume broadline distribution with Premier Farnell's

      specialization in proof of concept and design, we can offer true

      end-to-end solutions that accelerate a customer's time-to-market and

      moves their products seamlessly from prototype through to volume

      production," said William Amelio, Chief Executive Officer of Avnet. "As

      technology reaches deeper into more products and innovation proliferates

      through the internet of things, the ability to reach a wider base of

      engineers earlier in the design process will be critical to our future

      growth and success."

    


      Headquartered in Leeds, United Kingdom, Premier Farnell is a global

      distributor of electronic components that utilizes a digital platform to

History[edit]
The company was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds under the name of A.C. Farnell Limited.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966.[4] The company was located next to the Wetherby railway station: as it grew it moved into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and then in 1995, into offices in Armley.[5]
In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components.[6] As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year.[4] In 1996 it went on to buy the Premier Industrial Corporation, a leading United States distributor,[7] and in doing so changed its name to Premier Farnell.[4]
