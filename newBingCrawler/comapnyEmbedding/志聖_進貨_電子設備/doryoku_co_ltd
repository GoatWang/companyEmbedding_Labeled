Basic policies

In order to eliminate work-related accidents, the Showa Denko Group has promoted “Active Safety” activities since 2008 by using its original “Active Safety Checklist.”

Activities in 2015



■ Trends infrequency rate of lost-time injuries


While promoting Active Safety activities by making full use of the Active Safety Checklist, we also continued taking measures to prevent the recurrence of serious accidents that took place in 2014 (involving someone being caught in a machine) across all Group plants. As a result of these efforts, the number of accidents involving a person being caught in a machine decreased significantly in 2015.

Kitakata and Tatsuno Plants of Showa Denko received the Safety Merit Awards of the 2015 JCIA Safety Awards





In May 2015, Kitakata and Tatsuno Plants of Showa Denko received Safety Merit Awards of the JCIA Safety Awards. These awards are given to exemplary business sites that perform outstanding activities as part of voluntary promotion of security, safety and health in the chemical industry. The winners are selected based on on-site investigation and as a result of deliberations by the Safety Award Committee consisting of experts in the field. The Kitakata Plant received the award because the plant reassesses the results of risk assessments already conducted using different standards so that it can promote safety activities on an ongoing basis from different angles. The Tatsuno Plant was credited for its vibrant voluntary and communication activities conducted at worksites, such as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) activities, as well as campaigns such as one to encourage employees to call each other’s attention to unsafe behaviors.





Accident-free record certificate awarded by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
The Oyama Plant of Showa Denko, the Omuta Plant of Showa Aluminum Can, and Showa Denko Electronics all received an accident-free record certificate from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The certificate is given to plants whose accident-free record exceeds a certain number of man-hours worked that is set for each industrial category and classified into classes 1 to 5 depending on the period of no accidents. The man-hours worked with no accidents for the Oyama Plant, the Omuta Plant, and Showa Denko Electronics respectively exceeded 5.55 million (non-ferrous rolling class 2 standard), 1.7 million (metal product production standard), and 15.8 million (electrical machinery and apparatus production class 3 standard), and these records are still being added to.
