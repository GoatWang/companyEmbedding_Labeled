Acquisition


        24 Nov 2015
        
Strengthening capabilities in the Enterprise Internet of Things
Laird PLC, the global technology company, today announces that it has acquired LS Research (LSR), a
  leader in wireless product design and development, for a total cash consideration of $55m, which
  will be funded from existing debt facilities.
Background on LSR
Headquartered in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, with satellite offices in Madison (WI) and Eagan (MN), LSR
  is a company with embedded Radio Frequency (RF) products and services that simplify wireless and
  accelerate development for its customers. Its operations are split into three key areas which provide
  their customers with RF design services to enable Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) connectivity
  applications, RF products including certified wireless modules and antennas, and Electro-Magnetic
  Conductivity (EMC) testing to international certification standards. It provides Near Field, Local Area
  and Wide Area products and services to enable wireless connectivity and EIoT capabilities into the
commercial and light industrial markets.
Established in 1980, LSR has a strong track record of growth, having increased revenue significantly
  over the last five years, with comparable margins to the Laird wireless businesses and revenue of
  $21.6m in the year ended 31 December 2014. It is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full
  year of ownership. LSR will be integrated into the Laird operating model, (reporting as part of our
  Wireless Systems segment).
LSR will be a strategic and complementary fit with our existing M2M business. This acquisition adds
  new capabilities in embedded wireless solutions and services to Laird, provides us with new routes
  to market for our own products, and most importantly, extends our reach, presence and capabilities
  in the EIoT markets in which Laird is making significant strategic investment.
Benefits of the acquisition
Laird will look to integrate our existing capabilities and those of LSR in order to realise the benefits
  and opportunities of our combined technology, products, services and routes to market, while the
  skills of our new people will add bench strength to our engineering, sales and leadership teams. This
  will enable us to:

Expand our reach into the light industrial and commercial sectors
Provide a fast track to expanding our capabilities and scope of supply by adding new services in
  the form of upstream wireless connectivity design capabilities that enable EIoT ecosystems, and
  EMC testing facilities that can be used internally, as well as continuing to be offered to external
  customers
 Further drive our differentiation principles of innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed by
  adding new (pre and post sales) services and products and reducing time to market for new
  products

David Lockwood, Chief Executive, commented
“This is an exciting development for Laird and provides fantastic opportunities for us and for our
    customers. The capabilities that LSR brings to Laird will enhance our ability to deliver on the clear
    potential that the EIoT has to offer.”
