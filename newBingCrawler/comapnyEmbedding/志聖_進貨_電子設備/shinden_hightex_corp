BIO-key Signs Shinden Hightex Corporation As New Distributor


						Posted on November 21, 2016					

						by Alex Perala 



BIO-key has signed up a big new distributor in the APAC region. Called Shinden Hightex Corporation, it’s a Japan-based electronic components seller specializing in semi-conductor, RFID, and LCD products. According to a statement from BIO-key, the company counts Sony, Toshiba, NEC, and Panasonic among its clients, and brings in over $450 million in annual revenues.
The company will now distribute BIO-key’s consumer fingerprint scanners to interested clients. Commenting on the agreement, BIO-key Hong Kong Ltd. Managing Director Wong Kwok Fong highlighted the Windows 10 compatibility of BIO-key’s devices, and asserted that there are “many companies in the APAC market [served by Shinden Hightext] that could immediately benefit from our technology.”
For Shinden Hightex’s part, company president Tamotsu Shiroshita suggested that Japan has a particularly strong security focus in the lead-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
“We are very excited about adding BIO-key’s secure authentication solutions as our new product portfolio into national distribution through our enterprise and government,” said Shiroshita. “Security is the biggest concern in Japan which must be built quickly as social infrastructure, especially toward for the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo, Japan in 2020. It is very much an honor that we are able to deliver BIO-key’s products and solutions to protect us from security threats.”
