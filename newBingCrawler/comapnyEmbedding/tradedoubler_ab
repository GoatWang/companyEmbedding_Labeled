TRADEDOUBLER ACQUIRES THE SEARCH WORKS - THE UK's LARGEST SEARCH
ENGINE MARKETING COMPANY - AND SISTER COMPANY THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS

*          TradeDoubler has acquired all shares in The IMW Group,
  which includes The Search Works and those companies trading as The
  Technology Works

*          The newly combined entity will confirm TradeDoubler as one
  of the largest  online marketing companies in Europe

*          The acquisition expands TradeDoubler's performance-based
  product portfolio into the search market and provides
   opportunities for further geographic expansion

TradeDoubler AB (publ) today announced  its acquisition on July  25th
of all the issued shares in  Interactive Marketing Works Ltd and  its
subsidiaries ('The IMW  Group'). The  purchase price  amounts to  £56
million and will be paid in cash and bank guaranteed loan notes.

The IMW Group consists of two trading entities, 'The Search Works', a
well established search engine  marketing agency and 'The  Technology
Works', a technology provider for search engine marketing which is in
an investment phase,  whose products include  'BidBuddy®' - a  search
management technology.

The IMW Group  is a  profitable and  well managed  company which  has
built up a  significant client  base, including such  brand names  as
Asda, Comet,  EasyJet,  First  Choice, Interflora  and  The  Carphone
Warehouse.  The Group has a strong reputation within the industry for
professionalism and  driving return  on investment  for its  clients.
 The Group  was founded  in  1999 and  currently employs  108  staff.
Turnover for the rolling twelve  months preceding June 2007  amounted
to £69 million and gross profit for the same period was £7.8 million.

The acquisition complements and expands TradeDoubler's existing
performance-based product portfolio which includes affiliate
marketing, online advertising campaigns, pay-per-call and an online
tracking and ad-serving technology.  The newly combined offering has
great synergies for both TradeDoubler's and The IMW Group's client
bases.  Search engine marketing and affiliate marketing are the
largest direct response online marketing channels, with significant
growth forecasted in both areas.  Search marketing accounted for 45%
of European online ad spend in 2006 according to the IAB Europe / PWC
and Forrester Research predicts that European Advertisers will spend
almost €3 billion a year on search marketing alone by 2010 (up from €
856 million in 2004).

The Search Works is active in the UK, while The Technology Works  has
additional presence  in  Europe  and in  Asia.  TradeDoubler  has  an
extensive presence throughout Europe which spans 18 countries."Product  expansion   and   further  internationalisation   are   key
components  in  TradeDoubler's  growth  strategy.    The  acquisition
addresses both these areas  by rolling out The  Search Works and  The
Technology Works throughout  Europe and by  utilising The  Technology
Works' Asian  foothold  to  assess the  roll  out  of  TradeDoubler's
product offerings  into Asian  markets."  says William  Cooper,  CEO,
TradeDoubler.

Nick Hynes, CEO,  The IMW Group  adds, "There is  a natural  affinity
between  TradeDoubler's  products   and  services   and  the   search
management technology  that we  offer.  We also  believe there  is  a
strong cultural fit between our two organisations.  Together we  will
be able to offer unprecedented online marketing services and tools to
a range of clients across Europe and beyond."

Both companies  will  continue to  be  managed as  separate  business
entities,  while  benefiting  from  joint  corporate  services  where
appropriate. While  senior management  at The  Search Works  and  The
Technology Works will take  an active part in  the management of  the
combined TradeDoubler Group, there  are no plans  to make changes  to
the management of either company,

TradeDoubler expects  significant incremental  revenue  opportunities
from combining  its pan-European  organisation with  the IMW  Group's
search  marketing  offering.    The  IMW  Group  will  form  part  of
TradeDoubler's accounts  from  August  2007  but  will  be  presented
separately in reporting.  Excluding extraordinary transaction  costs,
TradeDoubler estimates  that  The  IMW  Group  will  give  a  neutral
contribution  to  TradeDoubler   during  2007.       The  impact   on
TradeDoubler Earnings per Share for  2007 is expected to be  slightly
negative due to  one off costs  relating to the  integration of  both
companies.   Acquisitions  sheets  will be  presented  in  the  third
quarter report.

TradeDoubler was advised by Keystone Advisers, Baker & McKenzie LLP
and KPMG LLP. The IMW Group was advised by Ingenious Corporate
Finance, Clarity Capital Partners Limited and Berwin Leighton Paisner
LLP.
