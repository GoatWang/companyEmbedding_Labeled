PECO: The most modern producer of Oil Dispenser in Vietnam - Petrolimex : Vietnam National Petroleum GroupTập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam Home>News & Events>Press Coverage on Petrolimex & PetroleumPECO: The most modern producer of Oil Dispenser in VietnamPhuong DzungIndustry & Trade Newspaper03:59' CH - Thứ hai, 16/09/2013Tatsuno, the Japanese name is known to the Vietnamese as the most modern and highly accurate oil dispenser in Vietnam.Petrolimex electronic oil equipment plant at 44 Sai Dong, Long Bien District, HanoiIndustry and Trade Newspaper: Many people know that Tatsuno oil dispensers produced and distributed by Petrolimex Petroleum Equipment Joint Stock Company but they do not know on what agreement they are produced and by what procedure they are made. We visited the plant of PECO and would like to introduce to you.Engineers and workers of PECO assembling oil dispensersAt the time being, PECO is producing two categories of goods. The first category of 100% Japanese origin i.e. equipment, components, calculating devices and the cover are Japanese made imported by PECO in SKD form. The products have Tatsuno brand name according to The Agreement on Technical Cooperation and Technology Transfer PE/TATSN/NMR-DP/2012 signed on Aug.24. 2012 between Peco-Tatsuno and Nomura. This category consists of models : Sunny-Rex, Sunny-ST, NEO-Sunny and Sunny-XE. The assembly is made according to Japanese experts’ training, instructions, and annual audit in order to guaranty quality and brand prestige. Next to it, PECO turns out the second category with PECO brand name. These category products have some localized contents: the important items remain from Japan, others are imported from third countries. These category products are marked as PECO1 to PECO5. The quality and accuracy remain assured but the cost is lower which is suitable to some market areas.Dispenser calibration before deliveryAll dispensers are to be inspected and calibrated up to standard before export. PECO is responsible for product quality by mandate from Vietnam General Department of Standard, Measurement and Quality, and subject to the latter’s mandatory surveillance and inspection.Ministry of Science and Technology Socialist Republic of Vietnam General Department of Standard, Independence-Freedom- Happiness Measurement and Quality -------No. 2147/QD-TDC Hanoi 30 Oct. 2012 DECISION ON CAPACITY OF MAESUREMENT CALIBRATION MEANS-----The Director GeneralGeneral Department of Standard, Measurement and QualityProceeding from the Law on Measurement dated 11 November 2011, Basing on Decision 104/2009/QD-TTg of 12 Aug. 2009 by The Prime Minister of the government regulating the function, duty, power and organizational structure of the General Department of Standard, Measurement and Quality and Decision 46/2011/QD-TTg of 22 August 2011 by the Prime Minister amending and supplementing Decision 104/2009/QD-TTg;Basing on Decision 20/2006 /QD-BKHCN of 10 November 2006 by the Minister of Science and Technology regulating the recognition of capacity of calibrating measurement devices and Circular No. 12/2011/TT-BKHCN of 30 June 2011 by The Minister of Science and Technology regulating the amendment and supplement of a number of items in the Regulation on the recognition of capacity of calibrating measurement devices published by Decision 20/2006/QD-BKHCN;In consideration of request of The Director General of Measurement Department,DecidesArticle 1.

Compressed Natural gas (CNG)




				CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) is a natural gas which of main composition is methane (CH4). It has been treated and compressed at high pressure (from 200-250 bar at ambient temperature) for advantage storage and transportation due to decrease the gas volume to 200-250 times.

Application

				CNG is a clean, environmental friendly fuel because it does not release toxic gases such as NOx, COx, SOX in combustion and virtually no dust. CNG engines can reduce 20% CO2, 30% NOx, 70% SOx and 50% of hydrocarbon emissions compared to gasoline engines.








Charts of comparison emmissons gas during the combustion of natural gas with other fuels





			Because of complete combustion, without causing sedimentation in the combustor and carburetors, CNG helps improve performance, extend the maintenance cycle and service life of machinery and equipment. CNG price is about 10%-30% cheaper than petrol and this price is stable for a long time compared to that of petroleum products. Therefore, CNG is now widely used around the world as an alternative fuel for motor. In addition, CNG is also used as a fuel for industrial consumers far from gas pipelines.

Situation of CNG production and consumption in Vietnam

			Currently, there are 28 buses using CNG fuel in HCM City. In the early stage of implementation of CNG bus launching, it has shown the advantages in terms of safety, economic efficiency, environmentally friendliness and well accepted by local people. According to the HCM City Department of Transportation, People's Committees of Ho Chi Minh city approved the project of operation more 300 CNG buses since 2014. The target of the project is to gradually replace the bus was damaged, degraded and no longer meet the technical standards of vehicles for public passenger.

			+ My Xuan CNG Plant, capacity: 100 million m3 per year
