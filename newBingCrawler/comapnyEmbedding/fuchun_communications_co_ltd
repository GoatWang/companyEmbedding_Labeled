Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. : Neutral assessment on price but strong on fundamentals 
January 13, 2017 by CapitalCube 


Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. relative valuation is now NEUTRAL. It was previously rated OVERVALUED, and has a fundamental analysis score of 75.
Our analysis is based on comparing Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. with the following peers – Onward Technologies Limited, Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Co., Ltd. Class A, Guangdong Eastone Century Technology Co., Ltd. Class A and Shenzhen Forms Syntron Information Co., Ltd. Class A (517536-IN, 600846-CN, 300310-CN and 300468-CN).
Relative Valuation
Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. is currently neutrally valued, as its previous close of CNY 20.48 lies within the CapitalCube estimate range of CNY 16.05 to CNY 20.79. Over the last 52 week period, Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. has fluctuated between CNY 19.30 and CNY 36.98.


Company Overview

From a peer analysis angle, relative underperformance over the last year has improved more recently.


Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. Class A currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (5.60) than its peer median (4.61).


The market expects 300299-CN to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.


300299-CN‘s relatively high profit margins are burdened by relative asset inefficiency.


The company’s year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group.


300299-CN‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years is around the peer median and suggest that it does not have any particular operational advantages versus peers.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While 300299-CN‘s revenues in recent years have grown faster than the peer median, the market gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median suggesting that the market has some questions about the company’s long-term strategy.


The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.


300299-CN has the financial and operating capacity to borrow quickly.


Investment Outlook
Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. has a fundamental score of 75 and has a relative valuation of NEUTRAL. 
Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. appears on the top right hand quadrant of CapitalCube’s Value – Price Matrix. We classify this as ‘Safety’. In other words, Fuchun Communications Co., Ltd. has a relatively high Fundamental Analysis score of 75, while being potentially overvalued and trading higher than its CapitalCube Implied Price of 18.42. There might be some safety in this stock where it’s fundamental strength perhaps justifies its relatively higher price.
