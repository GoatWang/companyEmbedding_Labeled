History[edit]
In 1922, WESCO Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation also based in Pittsburgh. It had existed for decades within Westinghouse as the subsidiary charged with selling and distributing company components in the electrical and industrial fields. WESCO maintained close ties to its parent. In 1994, the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) arranged for the purchase of WESCO from Westinghouse.
CD & R sold WESCO to The Cypress Group for $1.1 billion in June 1998. This group formed WESCO International, Inc., which is the current owner of WESCO Distribution.[3]
On May 12, 1999, WESCO held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, selling 9.72 million shares for $18 per share, raising $175 million.
In 2008, the company was recognized for "environmentally sustainable business practices" through an Environmental Stewardship Award from Veolia ES Technical Solutions.[4][notes 1]
In November 2010 the company acquired TVC Communications, a "distributor of broadband communications network infrastructure" for about US$250,000,000.[5]
In June, 2012 the company acquired Conney Safety for an undisclosed sum.[6][7]
