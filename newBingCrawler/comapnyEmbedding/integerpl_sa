	Once again easyPack by InPost turned out to be unbeatable in the e-commerce sector!

easyPack by InPost service is gaining an increasing recognition among the customers. This time, the revolutionary solution for sending and receiving parcels were announced to be the best logistic solution used in e-commerce business.

54% voted for easyPack by InPost in the Ekomersy contest, which gained an overwhelming advantage over DPD, the leading courier company in Europe, with 17% votes received from the users. Others were: KurJerzy.pl with 11% votes, Statkiem.pl and Arvato with 9% respectively. Thus, easyPack by InPost won the winning title of the Ekomersy contest organized by Fundacja Polak 2.0.

The award for the best operator in e-commerce sector is granted to companies that offer parcel delivery for e-stores, as well as logistic and operational services such as: shipment preparing, return handling and products storage.

Poczta Polska and other traditional courier companies lose their e-commerce customers for the benefit of a modern delivery type offered by InPost easyPacks, due to the rapid changes in the Internet sales. The most important is price and two even more valuable factors; time and delivery date.

"If there were no customers, there'd be no e-commerce sector as well. The virtual shopping , and delivery based on e-orders depends on them. The Internet users are responsible for the e-revolution, and the e-sector is currently valued at 24-25m PLN. That's why it is so important to meet the clients' needs and expectations. Therefore the fact of being better than traditional courier company is so excited", stressed Rafa

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
