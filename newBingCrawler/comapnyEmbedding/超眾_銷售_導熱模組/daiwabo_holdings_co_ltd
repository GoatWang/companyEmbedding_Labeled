The core organization of the Daiwabo Group is the  listed holding company “Daiwabo Holdings Co., Ltd.” This company implements the  growth strategy for the Group with a group management system that is based  around the three companies of “Daiwabo Information System Co., Ltd.,” which  develops our IT infrastructure distribution business, “Daiwabo Co., Ltd.,”  which supervises our fiber business companies and “O-M Ltd.,” which develops our  industrial machinery business.
 In the IT infrastructure distribution  business, we are one of the largest independent IT distributors in Japan. With  our basic policy of putting the customer first and taking a community-based  approach, we use our nationwide network of sales bases and our sales control  system and work in cooperation with our business partners to extend sales of a  great variety of terminal devices. We are also actively taking on the  challenges to advance into high growth market sectors such as mobile devices  and cloud computing.

Our fiber business delivers original functional  materials and products to the customers. This is made possible by our original  technologies, which are based on strong development capabilities that are  derived from the quality Japanese materials. It is also realized through our  Group cooperation strategy to effectively use the research bases, production foundations  and sales systems we have both in Japan and overseas.
In our industrial machinery business, one  main line of business is machine tools. We respond flexibly and quickly to the  requirements of the customers for these tools with “craftsmanship” that  utilizes our knowledge and skill, which is based on many years of proven  results. This response is also made possible by the effective management of our  production and sales bases both in Japan and overseas. In particular, we have  received vary favorable evaluations in the field of vertical lathes due to our  highly specialist and careful manufacturing using original technologies.
The Daiwabo Group will continue to follow  the Group’s management philosophy of “To create new values for the benefit of  customers in the global market by synergy of creation, renovation and fusion,  and to realize a future useful for human society and the environment of the  earth.” We will also work with the slogan of “For tomorrow’s smile” as our  corporate motto. We will resolutely take on the challenges posed by changes in  social structures and we will work to raise the value of the Daiwabo brand and  the level of satisfaction of all our stakeholders.
