AU Optronics (AUO) is a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer. It was formed in September 2001 by the merger of Acer Display Technology, Inc. (the former of AUO, established in 1996) and Unipac Optoelectronics Corporation. In October 2006, AUO acquired Quanta Display Inc. AUO has thus been operating production lines of various generations, capable of offering TFT-LCD panels from 1.4 to 85 inches in sizes. AUO was listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) in 2000 and was also the first pure TFT-LCD manufacturer to have been listed at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2002. AUO extended its market to the green energy industry in 2008 to provide customers with high efficiency solar solutions.
AUO generated US$12.9 billion in sales revenue in 2014 and now houses a staff of more than 45,000 throughout its global operations spreading across Taiwan, Mainland China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the United States, and Europe.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers 26 different countries.[1]

History[edit]

August 1996 Acer Display Technology, Inc. (the former of AUO) was founded
September 2000 Listed at Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation
September 2001 Merged with Unipac Optoelectronics Corporation to form AUO
May 2002 Listed at NYSE
October 2006 Merged with Quanta Display Inc., owning a full range of fabrication plants to meet all panel size requirements
September 2012 sentenced to pay a US$500 million criminal fine for its participation in a five-year conspiracy to fix the prices of thin-film transistor LCD panels sold worldwide. Its American subsidiary and two former top executives were also sentenced. The two executives were sentenced to prison and fined for their roles in the conspiracy. The $500 million fine matches the largest fine imposed against a company for violating U.S. antitrust laws. In July 2014, the Ninth Circuit rejected AUO's appeal of the fine.[2]

Products[edit]
AUO offers advanced display total solutions covering UHD 4K, ultra slim, narrow bezel, curved, transparent displays, LTPS, OLED, and touch solutions. Fabrication plants from Gen 3.5, Gen 4, Gen 4.5, Gen 5, Gen 6, Gen 7.5 to Gen 8.5 have been established to develop a full lineup of applications, offering TFT-LCD panels in sizes ranging from 1.4 inches to 85 inches. AUO is one of the top manufacturers of TFT-LCD panels in the world with a market share of 16.2% in large-sized panels.[3]
AUO owns a myriad of patents for its R&D efforts and was included in the 2014/2015 Ocean Tomo 300® Patent Index.[4]
AUO has shown considerable regard for the protection of the environment and was the first to have introduced the energy management platform. The endeavors made the Company the world’s first manufacturer to have acquired ISO 50001 energy management certification and ISO 14045 eco-efficiency assessment of product systems verification. [5]
Among their major customers, especially for TFT LCD products, there can be mentioned : Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, LG, Philips, Toshiba, Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, Sharp, Vestel, Beko.
Solar Business[edit]
AUO adopts the high quality materials from leading Japanese polysilicon provider M.Setek and AUO Crystal, and collaborates with solar cell leader SunPower to establish a vertically integrated solar value chain. This high efficiency value chain extends from polysilicon, ingots, wafers, solar cells to PV modules. By practicing the "Global Operation, Local Delivery" strategy, customers worldwide could be offered solar module products nearby from Europe, Taiwan, Mainland China, and the United States. Various solar utility projects have also been successfully completed around the world.
Corporate Social Responsibility[edit]

In 2012, AUO announced to reduce carbon emissions by 25% at all of its manufacturing sites by the end of 2015;
In 2013, AUO’s headquarters was certified by Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Administration to have attained carbon neutrality;
In 2014, AUO extended its carbon neutral project by inviting non-profit organizations in Taiwan to apply for carbon credits. To date, the Feitsui Reservoir in New Taipei City and Jinhua Village in Taoyuan City have been assisted to achieve carbon neutrality. In the same year, AUO was awarded the 2014 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards' Gold Prize;
In 2015, AUO was named to Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year.

AU Optronics Corp. (AUO), one of the world's leading providers of optoelectronic solutions. 
AUO was formed in September 2001 by the merger of Acer Display Technology, Inc. (the former of AUO, established in 1996) and Unipac Optoelectronics Corporation. In October 2006, AUO acquired Quanta Display Inc. AUO has thus been operating production lines of various generations, capable of offering TFT-LCD panels from small to large sizes. AUO was also the first pure TFT-LCD manufacturer to have been successfully listed at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). AUO extended its market to the green energy industry in 2008 to provide customers with high efficiency solar solutions.
AUO generated NT$329 billion in sales revenue in 2016 (US$10.16 billion) and now houses a staff of more than 43,000 throughout its global operations spreading across Taiwan, Mainland China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the United States, and Europe.
Display Innovations to Enrich Life with new Visual ExperiencesThe demand for new ways of enriching user interaction grows hand in hand with the desire for rich, immersive visual stimulation. AUO has utilized diverse applications and technologies, including ultra high resolution, high color saturation, curved display, AMOLED, integrated touch solutions and super narrow bezel, to transform people's visual experiences through our displays. Every technological advancement effort we make is to meet your demands. Fabrication plants from Gen 3.5, Gen 4, Gen 4.5, Gen 5, Gen 6, Gen 7.5 to Gen 8.5 have been established to develop a full lineup of applications, offering TFT-LCD panels in sizes ranging from 1.2 inches to 85 inches.
AUO's large-sized TFT-LCD panels hold a global market share of 16.3% (*). The Company is dedicated to providing its customers with innovative, high value-added product portfolios. Its full array of production lines are flexibly employed to develop all kinds of display applications, ensuring the Company to stay one step ahead with business opportunities secured and synergies achieved.
AUO owns a myriad of patents for its R&D efforts and was included in the 2015/2016 Ocean Tomo 300® Patent Index.  As of March 2017, AUO owns more than 17,100 patents worldwide, as well as over 23,100 patent applications.
High Efficiency Solar SolutionsAUO makes efforts in providing high reliability and premium quality solar solutions, including high-efficiency solar modules, all-round solar power plant service, and highly integrated service platform concerning energy management.

Low-carbon Initiatives for Sustainable EnvironmentAUO has been dedicated to the protection of the environment from the very beginning of product development and was the first to have introduced the energy management platform. The endeavors made the Company the world’s first manufacturer to have acquired ISO 50001 energy management certification and ISO 14045 eco-efficiency assessment of product systems verification. AUO was named to Dow Jones Sustainability World Index since 2010, marking significant milestones for the industry.
