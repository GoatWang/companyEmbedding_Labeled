NOTE 2: Occupational/controlled limits apply in situations in which persons are exposed as a consequence of their employment provided those persons are fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over their exposure. Limits for occupational/controlled exposure also apply in situations when an individual is transient through a location where occupational/controlled limits apply provided he or she is made aware of the potential for exposure. 
 Spectrum Research &   Testing Lab., Inc. No.167,Ln. 780, Shan-Tong Rd.,Ling 8, Shan-Tong Li, Chung-Li Dist., Taoyuan City 320, Taiwan (R.O.C.) TEST REPORT Reference No.: A15062402 Report No.: MPE15062402 FCC ID : 2ABL6-NP14 Page:6 of 8 Date: Jul. 16, 2015  FMNG-059_1.1 REPORT   3.2    TEST PROCEDURE 1.  The EUT was operating in Tx mode.    2.  The EUT uses an external antenna, the antenna gain of 2 dBi is declared by the manufacturer.  3.  As discussed in OET Bulletin 65, calculations can be made to predict RF field strength and power density levels around typical RF sources. For example, in the case of a non-directional antenna, a prediction for power density in the far-field of the antenna can be made by use of the general Equations (1) or (2) below [for conversion to electric or magnetic field strength see Equation (3) above]. These equations are generally accurate in the far-field of an antenna but will over-predict power density in the near field, where it could be used for making a" worst case" or conservative prediction.  S=PG/4πR²           (Eq. 1)   S=connect power/4πR²    (Eq. 2) S=E²/3770=37.7H²      (Eq. 3)    where:    S = power density (mW/cm2) E = electric field strength (V/m) H = magnetic field strength (A/m)  S = power density (in appropriate units, e.g. mW/cm2 ) P = power input to the antenna (in appropriate units, e.g., mW) G = power gain of the antenna in the direction of interest relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi) R = distance to the center of radiation of the antenna (appropriate units, e.g., cm) where: connect power = equivalent (or effective) isotropically radiated power.

An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: 2AA83-TP001 is 2AA83. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, -TP001, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.
