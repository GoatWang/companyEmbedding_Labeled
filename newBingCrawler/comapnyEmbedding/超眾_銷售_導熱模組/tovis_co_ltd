Product : Industrial Monitors
Industrial monitors can be used in, but not limited to, the core of specialty instruments, Gaming, Casino, Amusement, Medical, Signage, Public Information Display, Factory automation, etc.
Unlike standardized TV and PC monitors, and because of the harsher nature of industrial monitor use, reliability is critical. Industrial products have a shorter lifespan based on heavy use. Therefore, the replacement cycle is about every three years.
Tovis provides various industrial product sizes, ranging from over 50'' monitors, to small 6'' monitors.

Product : Industrial Monitors
Industrial monitors can be used in, but not limited to, the core of specialty instruments, Gaming, Casino, Amusement, Medical, Signage, Public Information Display, Factory automation, etc.
Unlike standardized TV and PC monitors, and because of the harsher nature of industrial monitor use, reliability is critical. Industrial products have a shorter lifespan based on heavy use. Therefore, the replacement cycle is about every three years.
Tovis provides various industrial product sizes, ranging from over 50'' monitors, to small 6'' monitors.
