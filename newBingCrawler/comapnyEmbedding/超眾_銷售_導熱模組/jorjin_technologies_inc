Company Overview
Jorjin Technologies Inc was founded in 1997, initially as a distributor for high performance wireless ICs and materials. The company has become the leading supplier of wireless system-in-package (SiP) modules and application processor system on module (SoM).  
The company has a global presence, with offices in Taiwan, mainland China, North America, Japan and the UK, in addition to a network of distributors and development partners.

Solutions
Jorjin offers a complete range of WLAN (802.11b/g/n) SiP modules incorporating Bluetooth, GNSS and FM radio, based on ICs from Texas Instruments Incorporated. These are targeted at mobile devices, and provide a fully verified and tested solution for smartphones, tablets, personal navigation devices and other applications. 
Jorjin offers a range of modems covering Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi standards.  We also support modules based on the CC3000 SimplelinkTM solution from Texas Instruments which offers WLAN connectivity to  microcontroller based solutions.
Our Application Processor Modules are based on Texas Instruments OMAP family of application processors. These contain the core components including processor SoC, power management and RAM. The current product line covers ARM Cortex A8, Dual Core A9 and we are now launching a high performance OMAP5530 Dual Cortex A15 platform.
Jorjin provides evaluation platforms as well as full software support for Android, Linux and WinCE operating systems. This module approach is cost neutral when compared to an on-board design and significantly reduces time to market.

An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: WS2-WG1300B0 is WS2. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, -WG1300B0, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.

Device operates with specific antennas in MIMO configurations as described in this filing. Compliance of this device in all final host configurations is the responsibility of the Grantee.
This device is to be used only for mobile and fixed applications. The antenna(s) used for this transmitter must be installed to provide a separation distance of at least 20cm from all persons and must not transmit simultaneously with any other antenna or transmitter. OEM integrators must be provided with antenna installation instructions and labeling requirements for finished products. End-Users must be provided with transmitter operation conditions for satisfying RF exposure compliance. This grant is valid only when the device is sold to OEM integrators and the OEM integrators are instructed to ensure that the end user has no manual instructions to remove or install the device. Separate approval is required for all other operating configurations, including portable configurations with respect to 2.1093 and different antenna configurations. This device has a 20 and 40 MHz bandwidth modes. A C2PC was certified on 9/15/2015 to add the following antennas: PCB Ethertronics -0.6dBi, Dipole LSR 2dBi, PCB Laird 2dbi, chip Pulse 3.2dBi, PIFA LSR 2dBi, and Chip, TDK 2.4dBi.
