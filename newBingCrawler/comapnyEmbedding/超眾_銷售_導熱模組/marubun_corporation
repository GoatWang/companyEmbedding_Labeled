Greeting








GAIA was established in April 2016 as a division company of Marubun Corporation.
In 1965, we became Japan's first dealer to import and sell ICs from Texas Instruments, which continues to offer revolutionary products and technologies to the world. For more than 50 years since then, we have brushed up on our product knowledge and technical strength as a leading dealer and constructed a worldwide sales and distribution network.
We will continue our endeavors to further improve our service quality to meet customers' expectations and requests.

CAUTION


Alert: Beware of fraudulent emails that pose as messages from the company's executives (December, 2016)
In December 2016, we became aware of a person posing as a Marubeni officer to send fraudulent emails asking a recipient to contact with the sender so that the sender passes across further information for immediate payment for certain new project.One feature of these messages was that their email addresses appeared similar to legitimate company email addresses.We caution all to confirm sufficiently the senders and contents of suspicious emails you may receive.
Alert: Beware of fraudulent emails that pose as messages from the company's executives (June, 2016)
In June 2016, we became aware of a person posing as a Marubeni officer to send emails which requested payment for a fictitious acquisition, and asked the recipient to provide information as directed by a third party posing as an attorney for that person.One feature of these messages was that their email addresses appeared similar to legitimate company email addresses.  We caution all to confirm sufficiently the senders and contents of suspicious emails you may receive.
Warning: Fraudulent offers (February, 2016)
Investment opportunity based on forged guarantee in the United StatesIn April 2015, Marubeni Corporation became aware of a fraudulent scheme to solicit investments for the development and operation of a shrimp farm in the United States that was described as relying on financial support in the form of guarantee to purchase product from the shrimp farming operation purportedly issued by Marubeni Corporation for the purchase of product from the shrimp farming operation. That guarantee is a false and forged document and that investment scheme is fraudulent and is unassociated with Marubeni Corporation, Marubeni America Corporation or any of the companies in the Marubeni Group.

Providing Total Semiconductor Business Based on Global Sales and Support Structures.
As a devices business unit, Marubun provides total solutions in the semiconductor business from marketing to technology support and delivery. Based on a business model that emphasizes close ties with customers at the point of contact between customers and suppliers, we strive for parts and materials procurement that provides benefits to our customers. We monitor customer product development trends and production plans and provide, in a timely manner, usefully technology information and support functions that anticipate the timing of this shift from design to commercialization. In addition, management structures made up of large-scale distribution centers and cutting-edge information systems achieve justin- time and stable supply of products. Marubun began importing and selling ICs immediately after their invention and in 1965 was the first company to successfully introduce integrated circuits to the Japanese market, playing a major role in the effective start of Japan's electronics industry. Based on this past performance and expertise, Marubun has become a trusted business partner.
