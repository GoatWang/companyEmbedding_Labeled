About ELK

				Established in 1999 in Daejon, ELK Corporation is a KOSDAQ listed company, with manufacturing facilities in Korea and China.
			

				A comparatively young company, we have quickly evolved and are now an established supplier of touch sensors and assemblies to many of the world's leading mobile phone and electronics companies.
			

				The company initially focused on manufacturing electro luminescent (EL) products.
				Pioneering the development of backlight technology, our products were used in the first generation of slimline designer mobile phones.
				This range of phone proved to be extremely popular around the world.
				Production levels quickly increased to many millions of units per month.
			

				Utilising this experience gained in printed electronics, in 2008 we diversified our product range to include touch sensors and applied our expertise to the mass manufacture these products.
				We currently manufacture and supply millions of touch assemblies every month.
			

				ELK's other services, such as touch sensor lamination to lens, glass lens production, and direct bonding of displays, were all developed to meet the growing needs and demands of our customers.
				We are now able to manufacture everything from an individual touch sensor to a complete touch screen display assembly.
			

				Recognising the need to provide a service that accommodates the needs and demands of our clients, we are able to adapt our working practises to synchronise with customers' supply chain models.
			




ELK has more than 10 years experience in printed electronics
ELK manufactures many millions of touch sensors every month
ELK can manufacture everything from an individual touch sensor to a complete touch screen display assembly
ELK has manufacturing processes and capacity optimized for the production of larger touch panels for tablet computers

Daejon

				The ELK Corporation's Head office and main manufacturing facilities are based in the Daeduk Techno-Valley, on the periphery of Daejon.
			

				140km south of Seoul, Daejon is Korea's fifth largest city and home to a plethora of private and public sector research institutions, the Korea University of Science and Technology, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and six universities.
			
Tianjin

				In 2010 ELK established a manufacturing and final assembly facility in Tianjin in Northern China.
				Many of our customers manufacture in China, and a local facility has enables us to supply and support them more effectively.
			

				120km south-east of Beijing, Tianjin is China's sixth most populous city, and a base to over half of Fortune Global 500 companies.
			

























ELK Corporation - Products - Glass Lens manufacturing

Glass Lens

				In the majority of Capacitive Touch panel applications, our customers specify a glass lens.
				Compared to plastic, glass is more scratch resistant, more easily cleaned, and tends to looks better for longer.
			

				To support these touch panel and Direct Bonding customers, ELK has invested in our own glass lens manufacturing capability.
				This capability covers etching, grinding, chamfering, and the cutting of holes, before chemically strengthening the glass.
				We also offer a full lens decoration service including printing and vacuum metalisation.
			

				ELK has experience of many coatings and treatments for glass lenses, including anti-reflection, anti-smudge, and anti-glare.
				We can advise customers on the best combination for their specific product and application.
			

				Specifying a glass lens manufactured by ELK can minimise transport and other supply chain costs.
				Nevertheless, ELK is willing to laminate our touch sensors, or offer a Direct Bonding service, using glass lenses supplied by our customers if this better suits their needs.

WINDOWS COMPATIBILITY ALERT
Windows 10, and now the latest updates for Windows 7 and 8, has been found to be incompatible with ELK-M1XEP firmware versions
                                            2.0.33 and older. ELK resolved this issue with firmware version 2.0.34. All new M1XEPs are being produced with firmware
                                            to support Windows 10 and up-to date versions of Windows 7 & 8. However, you must update the firmware in currently
                                            installed M1XEPs to restore connectivity with ElkRP2 and M1ToGo over the secure port.

    Other (Non-Roofing) Products:


    Non-Woven Products (US Only)


    In 1978, GAF of Texas began production of fiberglass nonwovens in our Ennis, Texas, facility. While Ultra-Mat® was
    originally developed for the roofing industry, GAF expanded its capabilities to include development and sales of both
    fiberglass and polyester mat for a variety of non-roofing markets. Today, GAF enjoys a solid presence and leadership position
    in the development and production of polyester nonwoven products, wet-laid industrial fiberglass products, and products with
    blends of fibers. The development of proprietary coating compounds in our Technology Center served as the foundation to
    invest in production capability and capacity for a coating process line in 2000.


    GAF Performance Nonwoven Fabrics include roll goods using fiberglass, polyester, and other blended fibers in a wet-laid
    process. GAF nonwovens are used in industrial applications including building materials, flooring, filtration, composite,
    reinforced plastics, landscaping, and other fabric markets.


    GAF has two production lines both utilizing a wet-laid process. GAF also operates a coating line designed to single-side or
    double-side coat a variety of fabrics. Proprietary coatings are developed to meet specific customer needs and requirements.


    GAF produces nonwoven materials from 0.8 oz/square yard to 5 oz/square yard at thicknesses ranging from 10 mils to 40
    mils. Roll widths range from 30" to 160", and roll diameters are possible up to 7 feet. Coatings can be added to a nonwoven
    fabric, typically from 3 oz/square yard to 29 oz/square yard.


    The path forward for GAF Performance Nonwoven Fabrics will focus on new fabrics designed to meet current and evolving
    customer requirements that demand attributes best achieved in blends of base fibers or coatings applied to fabrics. We have
    excellent working relationships with our suppliers, ensuring superior performance and consistency every time. Broad
    development and in-house testing capabilities include an on-site Research and Development Team, located in our state-of-
    the-art Research Center adjacent to the GAF nonwoven facilities.




    Ornamental Iron and Ductwork (Available in the U.S. Only)


    LL Building Products, part of GAF, began in 1938 with the founding of Leslie Welding Company in Chicago, Illinois, as a
    small specialty welding company also involved in making miscellaneous metal ventilation products.


    Locke Manufacturing was founded in the 1950s as a producer of ornamental iron railing and columns, and quickly became a
    leader in this industry, with the majority of their sales through retailers and distributors.


    In 1967 Locke Manufacturing was acquired, merging with Leslie Building Products Company, and Leslie Locke was formed to
    manufacture door accessories, ductwork, ventilation. and ornamental iron products. In 1998, GAF purchased Leslie Locke
    Building Products, forming a new division called LL Building Products Inc. LL Building Products still manufactures the same high
    -quality products. The products offered by LL Building Products are marketed under the MasterFlow® and 
    Village Ironsmith™ brands.


    The parent company, GAF, was founded in 1886 and is currently headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey. GAF is the
    most fully integrated roofing manufacturer in the United States, with more than 3,000 employees in 29 plants across the
    country.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
