Why choose Telsys for height restriction barriers?
We are the manufacturers of telescopic pole systems based in the northwest of the UK. We design and produce all our products so the guarantees and customer service all come down to us. We hold good stock levels and can help with bespoke requests to accommodate different industries.
We have an extensive network of distributors that you can choose from or we can supply directly should that be easier for you. Our minimum order is low and any large quantities would be welcome and dealt with.
We have taken the concept of height restriction barriers to a greater level in performance and safety with several innovations. In brief, the bases are designed for massive stability. Many times heavier than before. So much so we certified and independently tested the performance in wind speeds of unto 50mph – proving they work safely for longer in extremes of weathers, when you most need them.
