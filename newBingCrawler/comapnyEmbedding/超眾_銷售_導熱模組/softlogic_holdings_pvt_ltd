Softlogic to help Sri Lanka beat the heat with VEGO Air Coolers
Apr 02
2017

As temperatures begin their ascendance towards the seasonal peak in Sri Lanka, Softlogic Holdings is offering a way to beat the heat without the high investment and operating costs associated with traditional air-conditioning.
The country’s most dynamic retailer Softlogic Retail (Pvt.) Ltd. has been appointed sole distributor for VEGO, one of India’s leading Air Cooler brands and has announced the launch of two sophisticated models that operate on the evaporating air cooling principle -- the most efficient environment-friendly cooling technology available. 
 
With prices starting at just Rs 15,000/-, the ‘VEGO Typhoon’ and ‘VEGO Frost i’ represent the most cost-effective solutions for room cooling and reducing humidity with minimal depletion of resources, Softlogic Retail (Pvt.) Ltd., which will sell these units at selected Softlogic and Softlogic MAX showrooms, said.
 
“The Softlogic Group is already one of the strongest players in Sri Lanka in consumer electronics in which it represents a number of leading global brands,” said Mr Shehan Zahir, Product Group Manager at Softlogic Retail (Pvt) Ltd. “We are delighted to add the VEGO brand to our portfolio, and to represent an innovative product range that is perfect for the local market and local conditions.”
 
Weighing only 3.9 kgs and consuming just 95 watts of electricity, the VEGO Typhoon compact portable Air Cooler has a 20 litre water tank, three-way speed control and motorised louvers. It delivers air flow of 550 cubic metres per hour, can throw air to a distance of 20 feet and cool an area of 200 square feet. It has a ‘bed level air throw’ feature for precision cooling, uses honeycomb cooling media and can work off an inverter.
The sophisticated and higher capacity touch pad controlled VEGO Frost i Air Cooler has a 42 litre water tank, top-loading ice compartment, a smart looking intelligent LCD display and remote control. It generates air flow of 1,950 cubic metres per hour, can throw air up to 40 feet through an intelligently designed 7-inch blower, and cool an area of 300 square feet. Like the Typhoon, the Frost i also has motorised louvers and bed level air throw, and can work off an inverter. It consumes just 175 watts of power.
 
The VEGO brand is owned by VEGO Home Science Pvt Ltd. of Mumbai, India, and is part of a business group that has nearly 40 years of hands-on experience in various sectors such as Exports, Imports, Raw materials processing, Plastic moulding, Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) of Apparels & Garments and a strong foothold in Real Estate. The Group’s Air Cooler business is the result of a foray into White Goods, Home Appliances, Electronic Appliances and Kitchen Appliances. 
 
Softlogic Holdings PLC is one of Sri Lanka’s foremost, dynamic conglomerates, with leading market positions in the country’s growing economic sectors; retail, healthcare, ICT, automobiles, leisure and financial services. Softlogic holds Authorized Distributorships for key global brands and today, employs over 9,000 people in its offices located in Sri Lanka and Australia.

Values
We are the value drivers. Reliability, trust, constructive conservatism, esprit de corp and integrity are clichés. It is the clear unwavering guidance which defines the cultural context in which we work and interact with our business partners, our community and with each other. At Softlogic, this is a two-way process where employees are the backbone of Softlogic values and the community our corpus. 
Through our High Performance Culture, Innovation, Integrity, Human Capital, Success, Accountability, Corporate Responsibility and Simplicity; we have created a transparent organizational culture where ideas flourish, people thrive and success prosper.
 
High performance culture
We perform. We are committed to a result-oriented and customer-centric culture where success is shared and celebrated across the Group. We place customers at the centre of our activities and we hold ourselves responsible to deliver what we promise in keeping with customer needs with a determination to excel and a commitment to action. A “can do” attitude has proven to be the key performance driver across Softlogic.

Our group-wide innovation contest is just one of the ways in which we promote this creativity.
 
Integrity
Action speaks louder than words! We are self-effacing. But we act fairly, honestly and show respect and value all individuals for their diverse backgrounds, experiences, styles, approaches and ideas. We believe in ethics and transparency in all our dealings. 
 
Human capital
We nurture people and they are our most important asset. We benefit from the diversity of our business and our people by working together to achieve success with clear recognition, utilization, retention of good talent and appreciation of employee skills and talents. We treat all our staff with utmost respect and dignity, provide opportunities for career enhancement and cross fertilize for disciplined valour.

We succeed. We also ensure that the maximum return is provided to all stakeholders.

We have a fiduciary duty to our customers and business partners. We care for the community and the environment, delivering the maximum benefits of responsible business practices and take responsibility to protect them. At Softlogic, Corporate Responsibility goes beyond words where we strive to think and act as a good corporate citizen whilst supporting worthy causes and CSR projects.
 
Simplicity
Simplicity is the core value that expresses the personality and the style of Softlogic where simple value of “effectiveness” is embodied enabling us to deliver effective solutions and results to our customers. It is also a company philosophy – having simple processes, procedures and activities in place to take decisions quickly and rapidly transform ideas into fruitful results.
 
Dynamism
Whilst integrating our tradition of unyielding trust and relationship with our stakeholders, we possess the flexibility and dynamism required to adapt to increasingly changing markets. Our spirit comes from rare tenacity and dynamism, a Group seeking to be the market leader while seizing opportunities so that new frontiers open for greater rewards.
