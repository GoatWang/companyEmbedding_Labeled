Anton Bauer Dionic HC overview




1Description







The Anton Bauer Dionic HC is a lithium-ion chemistry battery for professional videographers. Weighing less than 2 pounds, the battery is compatible with existing Anton Bauer Interactive2000 PowerChargers and the Titan series chargers. It offers a Maxx Warranty and Real Time LCD gauge readout.




Real Time Display 


										
												The Dionic HC Battery automatically detects the camera load and calculates the battery's run-time based upon existing operating conditions. The readout is an easy-to-read LCD.
										  
										 


Compatibility 


										
												Dionic offers complete compatibility with PowerChargers already in the field (may require software chip update) and the Titan series. 
										  
										 


Cell Chemistry 


										
												Dionic contains an exclusive cell configuration unlike any other video battery. Instead of using cells originally designed for lighter-duty applications, such as computers, this battery is constructed with specialized lithium-ion cells originally designed for high-rate military applications.

Native and web optimized

        Ionic emulates native app UI guidelines and uses native SDKs, bringing
        the UI standards and device features of native apps together with the
        full power and flexibility of the open web. Ionic uses Cordova or
        Phonegap to deploy natively, or runs in the browser as a Progressive Web
        App.

Loved by some of the best people and companies on earth
  

    Ionic is a shining example of a high-quality framework that takes advantage
    of Angular's power and flexibility, enabling developers to build
    production-ready mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps, in a fraction of the
    time.
  

    Ionic is the framework that I use for all of my projects, and I'm not sure I
    can give a bigger compliment than that. The innate sense of style and
    sophistication built into Ionic is awesome and makes building
    professional-level mobile applications a snap.
  

    Ionic will dramatically change the way mobile apps are built. Their choice
    of AngularJS means building functionality is now a breeze and it feels
    near-native. Your developers and your users will thank you.
  

    I was so inspired when I found Ionic. It fills a gap that’s missing when
    building for mobile and solves many complexities that otherwise require
    multiple libraries, keeping your code cleaner. Overall, it just makes mobile
    development fun and fast, so you can build more!

Anton Bauer Dionic HC overview




1Description







The Anton Bauer Dionic HC is a lithium-ion chemistry battery for professional videographers. Weighing less than 2 pounds, the battery is compatible with existing Anton Bauer Interactive2000 PowerChargers and the Titan series chargers. It offers a Maxx Warranty and Real Time LCD gauge readout.




Real Time Display 


										
												The Dionic HC Battery automatically detects the camera load and calculates the battery's run-time based upon existing operating conditions. The readout is an easy-to-read LCD.
										  
										 


Compatibility 


										
												Dionic offers complete compatibility with PowerChargers already in the field (may require software chip update) and the Titan series. 
										  
										 


Cell Chemistry 


										
												Dionic contains an exclusive cell configuration unlike any other video battery. Instead of using cells originally designed for lighter-duty applications, such as computers, this battery is constructed with specialized lithium-ion cells originally designed for high-rate military applications.

Company Profile
The search engine with the name Skroutz, which was founded in 2004 by a group of Electrical Engineers-alumni of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), commenced its operation with the participation of just 15 electronic stores and 40,000 products. Very soon, though, due to its ingenuous name as well as its particularly reliable operation, it was vastly known to tens of thousands of users of the Greek Internet.It evolved into an Anonymous Company – SKROUTZ S.A. – in 2006 and today is a member of the Dionic Trading & Industrial S.A. Group of companies, which, aiming to the further development of its activities concerning the provision of Internet services proceeded to the acquisition of the 50% of the company.SKROUTZ S.A. has as main activity the expansion and development of the possibilities of the www.skroutz.gr search engine but at the time www.gameover.gr and www.mobilearena.gr, but also its commercial utilization. Its activities are complemented by Internet service providing, such as Internet websites production and the creation and commercial utilization of Internet portals.Skroutz is one of the largest engines of multiple searches on the Greek Internet, which allows the users visiting and using it, to find immediately and easily the store from which they can obtain the product or the service which interests them.Today, it serves thousands of users daily. It has over 30,000 different visitors every day, while over 50,000 searches are realized daily, presenting a continuous growth of its traffic from month to month, at a rate of 10%. At the same time, it is continuously enriched with new information and possibilities, which help its users to have an increasingly complete picture of the market. Since November 2006, the engine evolved also into an electronic auction tool for products, thus giving an additional boost to its development.Skroutz concerns exclusively products that the Internet user can obtain from electronic stores (which operate either on the Greek Market or foreign markets and have the possibility to serve the Greek customers), while it is continuously updated for all the new products of the market, which are available to the consumers through electronic order. It compares their prices in an extremely fast way and with the use of the most up-to-date search tools. With the help of the search engine, users can find the store which will give them the possibility for the best buy. At the same time, it offers the possibility of product auction provided by the users themselves, as well as the possibility to locate technological articles and product news.In addition to all that, Skroutz users are offered the possibility to read presentations and comparisons from renowned Greek and foreign websites, to communicate with each other through messages, but also to participate in online discussions. The users are invited to perform a search with the engine, using one or more keywords which are directly related to the product of their interest, and immediately receiving all the above results, sorted according to type (store prices, active auctions, articles and technology news).Recently, skroutz.gr was issued in a mobile edition (possibility for use from mobile phones or PDAs, through the electronic address www.mobile.skroutz.gr) and its use is free of charge.

 Pure Effect window Cleaning 




 It's a fantastic system, it cleans better, the work is easier. As for the winter, using hot water has definately enabled me to keep working. You could work in 2 inches of snow if you wanted. to. 
           
 Andy Harding 
 Matrix Window Cleaning 




 I've been using Ionic's hot water Thermopure for four years, it's especially faster on first cleans. Hot systems are more expensive but I wouldn't be without it, espcially in Winter months.
