Our products prevent flames from spreading by developing a chemically self-extinguishing reaction. Flame Stop® fire retardants and Fire Barrier Caulks and Puttys are the most user-friendly, inspector-friendly, and checkbook-friendly fire protection products on the market today. Our labor-saving spray-on fire retarding applications and intumescent paint are suitable for interior woods, exterior woods, closed-cell foams, open-cell foams, and most types of fabrics. 
All fire retardant coatings can, and eventually will, deteriorate, but Flame Stop® products are designed to last longer. We incorporate low-pressure spray equipment in comparison to the two to three applications with high-pressure equipment that most fire retardants require. In fact, Flame Stop®II actually becomes part of the substrate and bonds to it's molecular structure. 
The Result? Longer Protection, fewer applications and greater time and cost savings for you! 


With Flame Stop®, you never need to worry about safety, because all of our products are completely non-toxic. 


Our number-one concern is the safety of the public and the installers, so all Flame Stop® products are backed by bona-fide test reports by one or more of the following testing laboratories — Intertek - Southwest Research - Underwriters Laboratories - Underwriters Laboratories of Canada - United States Testing. We have also passed the 25.853 and 23.853 tests with the FAA.
Our test and installation procedures are in accordance with these standards — ASTM E119 - ASTM E814 - ASTM E84 - BOCA - CABO - ICBO - IEEE634 - NFPA 255 - SBCCI - UL 1479

CRAFTSMANSHIP
Our focus on the details and perfection that every chassis receives from the very beginning is what makes In Win chassis truly authentic.
Aluminium melted at the scorching heat of 700 degrees Celsius takes the appearance of a red liquid, but will transform to its familiar silver tone once it’s set into a mold to cool down.






COMMITMENT
We continue to strive for excellence. It is a continuous investment of our attention and energy to make every customer satisfied.









IN WIN SPIRIT
With no sharp edges, the logo also portrays a state of energetic harmony between art and technology.

Rubicon is the world leader in sapphire crystal growth technology andlarge-diameter sapphire substrates.

With its unmatched, end-to-end ability to manufacture and deliver superior quality sapphire, Rubicon helps manufacturers in the LED, RFIC and optical industries achieve challenging targets for product performance, yield and total cost. As demand for larger diameter sapphire escalates, more manufacturers in dynamic, growing markets trust Rubicon and its proven ability to deliver high volumes of the highest quality substrates.




Patterned Sapphire Substrates
Rubicon Technology, Inc., the global leader inlarge-diameter sapphire substrates, has leveraged its unique expertise to create a complete line of Patterned Sapphire Substrates—PSS—up to 8” in diameter. We offer fully customizable sub-micron patterning capability with tight dimensional tolerances, within ± 0.1 μm. With an edge exclusion zone as small as 1 mm, Rubicon gives you more usable area to maximize the number of chips per wafer. 

 

Vertical Integration – Powder to Pattern
Rubicon Technology is the only sapphire manufacturer that is vertically integrated from the processing of raw aluminum oxide powder to the creation of highly customized patterned sapphire substrates.  Vertical integration has fostered the ability to grow progressively larger sapphire while maintaining exceptional sapphire quality, controlling cost, and excelling as the industry’s most reliable, consistent and innovative technology partner.
