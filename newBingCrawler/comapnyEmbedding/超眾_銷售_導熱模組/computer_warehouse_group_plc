We equip them, give them up-close mentoring and follow through after, to ensure that they reach desired maturity in the end. Of the over 800 graduates from the Academy, about 85% have been employed in leading companies such as IBM, CWG, MTN, Standard Chartered Bank, Stanbic-IBTC, Chevron, Cadbury, Etisalat, Ericsson and Unilever among others, while about 10% have opted to become IT entrepreneurs.”He further explained that CWG’s CSR policy thrust is built on the twin pillars of Educational and intellectual development.

And, this age of innovations has made technology cheaper. Today, you do not h⋯⋯ave to be in all locations but you can open an online store and be visible in many locations. You can stay in one location and be able to track what you have in multiple shops that you own. And, we have rolled out a couple of such innovations uniquely for SMEs that you will need to exploit”, he advised. He gave this insight in a presentation at the 2nd annual conference of the National Association of Small and Medium scale Enterprises (NASME), held in Lagos, recently. The event which had in attendance over 200 hundred business owners, representatives of government agencies, finance institutions and interest groups serves as a platform whereon key players in the industry deliberate on creating sustainable opportunities for MSMEs to grow. In his presentation titled ‘Ten lessons we have learnt at CWG Plc”, Mr. Agada shared ten lessons every entrepreneur should learn  from CWG Plc in order to attain entrepreneurial success. According to Mr. Agada, these lessons are predicated upon a collection of experiences founders of CWG Plc had in the journey from being a start-up to being a Pan-African ICT firm. “The intervening years between when we were a start-up business and now have not been all rosy but each challenge and achievement we have faced and scaled served as lesson that has kept us going strong,” he said. He pointed out that the need to grow and preserve brand identity is the first lesson entrepreneurs must learn from the CWG experience.  “It is how you project your brand that is going to add so much value to your business and you have to spend time and energy in building your brand. One of such ways is going the extra mile to deliver on your promises and making sure people know that you are doing the things you do”, he said. Next to branding, Mr. Agada said, is the need for partnership. According to him, “We learnt that if the journey is far, you will get there with less stress if you are walking with somebody else. Partnership is important. And, it isn’t just about people who complement you but companies that will complement you.” He also encouraged the business owners to make adherence to processes a priority. “Having a sustainable process is what is going to allow you bring people off the street and make them become profitable and productive for you. If you alone have the knowledge of how things run in your head, you will not be able to grow”, he said. Mr. Agada also stressed the importance of corporate governance to the sustainability of any business. He explained “If you have a powerful CEO, he can easily drag the company down by taking the wrong decisions because nobody can challenge him. So you need someone to challenge you.  This starts with simple things. For instance, the business fund is not your money. It is the money of the business. You can pay yourself salary but separate the business money from your money.” Transparency, he noted, is another key lesson entrepreneurs should imbibe in order to grow. “Some people say they will not prepare their P&L because of government tax. But, you know what? If your secretary, friend or accountant helps you prepare fake financial statements so you can dodge tax, how would you know the difference if the same friend prepares a fake statement to cheat you? You won’t”, he said. He also highlighted the importance of creative evolution, having long term realistic plan corporatizing and placing premium on their customer’s interest to their survival and growth. In sum, Mr. Agada pointed out that SMEs need to aim high and strive with their vision to survive. “You need to make people realize that you are aiming to be a big company. For example, if you are aiming to be like Proctor and Gamble for example, you need to think and act like Procter and Gamble. That is what we have come to learn in our 23 years”, he said. 更多更多中文(台灣)English (US)Tiếng ViệtBahasa Indonesiaภาษาไทย日本語EspañolPortuguês (Brasil)Français (France)DeutschItalianoMessengerFacebook Lite用戶地標遊戲地點名人Marketplace社團食譜MomentsInstagram關於刊登廣告建立粉絲專頁開發人員工作機會隱私政策CookieAd Choices使用條款設定活動紀錄 Facebook © 2017
