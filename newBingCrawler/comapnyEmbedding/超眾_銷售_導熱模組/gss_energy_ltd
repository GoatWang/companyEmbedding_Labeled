GSS Energy (“GSS”) share price plunged 31 percent to close at $0.097 on 24 Jul 2015 after the announcement that KUD had terminated the services of GSS’ subsidiary PT Cepu Sakti Energy (“PT CSE”). 
Subsequently, in tandem with the weak equity market, GSS continued to weaken to touch a multi month low of $0.069 before closing at $0.079 on 2 Oct 2015.
So, What Caught My Attention?
First of all, GSS’ chart (seems like a potential base formation in the making) and low valuations caught my eye. Below are some interesting factors which caught my eye.
1)	Effects of settlement with Java Petral Energy
Table 1 summarised the effects of the settlement agreement between GSS and Java Petral Energy (“JPEL”). Three noteworthy points caught my attention.
a)	Speed of reaching settlement agreement
GSS first announced the termination of the cooperative agreement between KUD and PT CSE on 24 Jul 2015. 
Recall that GSS first acquired 53.68 percent of the issued share capital of PT CSE from JPEL on 10 Sep 2014 partly on the basis PT CSE would be able to participate in the oil extraction services business in Dandangilo-Wonocolo oil fields. With the termination of the agreement between KUD and PT CSE, GSS immediately renegotiated an agreement with JPEL. 
In less than a month, GSS announced an amicable settlement agreement with JPEL (see Table 1 below).
b)	Outcome may be favorable in the long run
On 10 Sep 2014, when GSS commenced its $48 million acquisition by acquiring 53.68 percent of issued share capital in PT CSE, PT CSE only has the rights to extract oil from Dandangilo-Wonocolo and Tungkul oil fields. 
However, after the settlement agreement on 17 Aug 2015, GSS paid $15 million and acquired 100 percent of issued share capital in PT CSE which has the rights to extract oil from Tungkul, Kawengan, Trembul and Gabus. As a result, the outcome might be favorable in the long run.
c)	Part of the $32.9m impairment provision may be written back 
GSS has already accounted for the impairment provision of $32.9 million due to the termination of agreement between PT CSE and KUD for the management of oil wells at Dandangilo-Wonocolo. 
After this settlement agreement, based on my simplistic reading, there is a chance that part of the impairment provision may be able to be written back.

Source: Company
2)	Pertamina cancelled KUD agreement due to KUD’s non compliance
According to RHB, Pertamina cancelled the agreement with KUD due to the latter’s noncompliance with contract terms. This cancellation does not affect GSS’ other four fields as these are contracted with state government corporations (“BUMDs”).
3)	NAV / share is likely to increase
GSS’ net asset value (“NAV”) per share is around $0.089 with a price to book of approximately 0.9x. It is noteworthy that GSS’ average price to book for the past five years is around 1.7x. Furthermore, GSS’ NAV / share may increase in the future given the following factors: 
a)	Cancellation of 76m consideration shares
Pursuant to the settlement agreement with JPEL, 76 million shares will be cancelled by way of capital reduction. Thus, GSS’ number of outstanding shares will decrease from 472.6 million shares to 396.6 million shares. This should have a positive impact to its earnings per share and NAV / share.
b)	One off gain amounting to $6m from relocation land sales
According to the management, there is likely to be an approximate non-recurring RMB27 million gain (translating to around $6 million) due to relocation land sales in China. My guess is that it is likely to be recognised in FY16F.
c)	Possibility of some impairment provision being written back
As I mentioned above, part of the $32.9 million impairment provision may be written back. (See point 1c above)
4)	1HFY15 Precision engineering net profit $3.1m, compared to $2.0m for FY14
Precision engineering (“PE”) has been GSS’ core business for decades. According to RHB, Nextinsight and based on company’s financial statements, GSS’ PE business seems to have gained traction with 1HFY15 net profit for its PE business hitting $3.1 million vis-à-vis $2 million recognized in FY14. 
This segment is likely to be the bright spot in the next couple of years as firstly, GSS has taken on new products with good margins. 
Secondly, it has retired those products which have reached their tail end of the product cycle where such products typically have lower margins. 
Thirdly, the company has exercised cost management and increased automation which are likely to have helped margins.
In addition, GSS has clinched a new customer to supply machined parts for its game console, commencing in the latter part of FY16. A more significant impact may be felt in FY17F. 
5)	GSS’ current market price seems to ascribe zero value to its oil segment

According to RHB, GSS current valuations seem to ascribe zero value to its oil business if a reasonable multiple is given to its PE business. It is also noteworthy that GSS is in a net cash position. 
The oil business segment may have positive surprises in the next few months if management can execute on the following:
a)	Potential KSO
GSS is working to convert one of its fields to a KSO arrangement. At current oil prices, management feels it makes more economic sense as KSO allows full cost recovery. 
According to RHB, the KSO arrangement typically spans 20 – 30 years and it allows all economically recoverable reserves to be recorded as reserves.
b)	GSS – AFCO oil trading business
On 2 Jun 2015, GSS inked an agreement with AFCO Energy Pte Ltd to invest into a joint venture company for the marketing and distribution of mineral oil and crude oil products and related businesses in Indonesia. 
GSS’ role is akin to a broker who originates trades. AFCO’s role is its reputation, financial strength, expertise in the storage and distribution of oil and oil related business. Management expects GSS – AFCO oil trading business to commence this year.
c)	Ramba’s West Jambi exploration program 
On 19 May 2015, GSS gained access into oil and gas concession in Sumatra by investing US$5 million investment in Ramba’s Energy’s drilling operations at West Jambi block. 
This allows GSS to gain exposure in a new geographical location where it previously has no exposure. 
Noteworthy Points
1)	Confidence in GSS shattered due to a series of events
Firstly, with the clairvoyance of hindsight, GSS acquisition in PT CSE was ill timed as oil price has halved since Sep 2014. 
Secondly, one of the attractive points in GSS was its average selling price of oil which was supposed to be fixed annually by Pertamina. 
However, in view of the plunging oil price, Pertamina amended the fixed price arrangement to market price. Thirdly, the sudden termination of the agreement between KUD and Pertamina was another negative shock which reduced (yet again) market’s confidence in GSS. 
Sentiment and confidence in GSS’ management and business are likely to take some time to recover. 
2)	Exposure to one of the unloved industries at the moment
GSS’ exposure to the oil industry, one of the most unloved industries (besides commodities), is unlikely to help its sagging share price. 
Nevertheless, according to World Bank, IMF and EIU, oil price is likely to bottom in 2015. (See Chart 1 below)
Chart 1: Oil price likely bottom in 2015

Chart Analysis
GSS has been range bound between $0.069 – $0.095 since 30 Jul 2015. Both RSI and MACD are exhibiting bullish divergence with price. 
Any upside / downside breakout at $0.095 / $0.069 with volume on a sustained basis points to a measured technical target price of $0.121 / $0.043. 
Based on current chart observation, the odds of an eventual upside breakout is more than 50 percent. (See Chart 2 below)
Near term supports: $0.073 / $0.069 / $0.065
Near term resistances: $0.081 / $0.087 / $0.095

Conclusion 
Personally, in order for GSS share price to re-rate, we have to see that it clinches its 1st KSO, commencement of its GSS – AFCO oil trading venture, positive news on West Jambi block and continued strength in its PE business.

ABOUT GSS
THE GSS JOURNEY
The GSS team benefits from over 30 years’ experience and in excess of 240 international projects. With a plethora of diverse yet complimentary skill sets, GSS Energy provides clean, sustainable and cost effective solutions to the problems of waste management and continuously increasing energy costs. Using advanced, state of the art technologies which do not utilise a combustion process, emissions are minimal and even the by-product has a monetary and environmental value.
Our core technology is Pyrolysis which has been known for a long time to be an ideal solution for the conversion of troublesome waste materials into useful energy cleanly. More importantly until now it has long been unknown how to achieve this on a commercial scale both efficiently and cost effectively. GSS Energy has designed and produced a process and technology to achieve this.Furthermore GSS Energy has been successful in turning this process into a compact and portable form achieving levels of efficiency that create a ratio of 1:1. That is ‘one tonne of waste producing 1MW of electrical energy, dependent on the energy content of the waste feedstock.
GSS is managed by a dedicated team with a long history in the energy & bio-renewables sector. With a broad skill-set they are acutely aware that if we are to continue to expand the infrastructure essential to support the increase of population and the resultant drive for a better standard of living in all parts of the World, we must find a cleaner, more efficient sustainable process for generating power and dealing with waste, without accelerated depletion and corruption of our natural resources.
The World’s drive for economic prosperity is literally poisoning the environment that we live in. As a result the team have developed an intense and passionate motivation to apply their knowledge and experience to develop a clean, highly efficient method of power generation that delivers not only the lowest achievable emissions but also reduces the increasing reliance on valuable natural resources.

THE TECHNOLOGY
THE  TECHNOLOGY OF PYROLYSIS
Pyrolysis is essentially the thermal decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen.It involves the simultaneous change of the chemical composition and physical phase of a waste material, converting the waste to its simplest gaseous form of Hydrogen and Carbon.The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyr “fire” and lysis “separating”.
The practice of pyrolysis was used thousands of years ago in the Amazon rainforest to create bio char. The indigenous peoples started fires and when the fuel was hot enough covered it with earth to deprive the fire of oxygen. The high temperature would continue to break down the fuel but in the absence of oxygen bio char was produced rather than ash.
More recently pyrolysis was used with wood waste feedstock during the two World Wars to produce transportation fuel when fossil fuels were unavailable.
By 1945 trucks, buses and agricultural machines were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on bio- derived gas all over the world.
