Description of manufacturer


SK-Electronics CO.,LTD.was established in October, 2001 as a spin-off from the Electronics Division of SHASHIN KAGAKU Co., Ltd., the world’s first manufacturer of large-format photomasks for liquid crystal panels produced from large electron beam drawing equipment. The company has positively developed technology together with its material suppliers and equipment manufacturers as a pioneer in the market of photomasks for flat panel displays.

Product description
Large-format Photomasks


"A photomask is the master mask used pattern forming. It is a clear glass substrate coated with an opaque material in which the pattern of the display panel or electronic device being manufactured is etched. 
                    
					Tens of thousands of electronic devices are manufactured through the combination of photomasks with several layers of different patterns.
                    
					 SK-Electronics CO.,LTD. manufactures large-format photomasks used in the manufacturing of display panels and electronic devices. They offer optimal photomasks for various types of products in sizes ranging from from 6 x 6 inches to over 1 square meter.

Product features
At present, in the manufacturing of LCDs, there is high demand for photomasks with line width patterns of several microns for use on glass substrates with angles that exceed 1 m.
					SK-Electronics creates high-definition patterns within the sub-micron level accuracy with its original pattern generation and process technology,
					 Furthermore, in recent years in order to improve the display quality in the manufacturing process of shortening panels, the active development and production of multi-tone mask technology has been sought after, and SK-Electronics has been leading the industry in the mass production of multi-tone masks for liquid crystal displays up to the 8th generation.
Applications
TFT-LCD, SED, FED, FPD in general such as organic EL
