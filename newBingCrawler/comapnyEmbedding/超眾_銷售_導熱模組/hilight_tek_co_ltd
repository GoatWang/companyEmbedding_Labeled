					Micro-structure light guide plate

					      ENTIRE manufacture 
					micro-structure light guide plate through extrusion process 
					which apply to edge type BLU. It can guide light of uneven 
					point light source into even plate light source. The optical 
					efficiency and uniformity is better than conventional light 
					guide plate. 

					Properties


 Great 
						optical performance: Higher uniformity and brightness 
						optical performance than conventional PMMA light guide 
						plate with printing.



						Excellent dimension stability: Lower water absorption 
						rate with better dimension stability withMS 
						micro-structure material compare to conventional PMMA 
						material LGP (Figure 1). 



						Thickness reduction: 2mm thickness Entire’s LGP can use 
						to replace conventional PMMA 3mm LGP.



						Customized design: Customized design for different needs.
						



						Quality assurance: All products obtain UL-94 and RoHS 
						certificates.





					Figure 1. Good dimension stability with Entire’s MS material 
					LGP:The water absorption rate of PMMA is 2 times than MS 
					in 24 hrs, and long term is increasing 3.5 times.

※ ENTIRE LGP advantage is low 
					water adsorption and good dimension stability.
Application


Edge type BLU. 


LED lighting applications.


Application for PID BLU.


ENTIRE micro-structure LGP 
					products
Two types of micro-structure 
					LGP provide different needs for customers.
