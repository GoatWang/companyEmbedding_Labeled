-PRISM SHEET
It is necessary for LCD to have BLU(Back Light Unit) because they can not self luminance. In BLU structure, the light generated from CCFL or LED, that is passing through THE LGP, is converted to surface light source. After that, the light is diffused evenly while passing diffuser sheet. 
Owing to less luminance efficency through this process, there is prism sheet that makes the luminance improve 1.5 to 2 times using accumulation on the front luminance.

Company Name:   LMS Co., Ltd.
Product Name:     Prism Sheet
Display division succeeded, for the first time in the country, in localization and mass production of low-loss, high-efficiency luminance-enhanced film that light efficiency for brighter LCD(Liquid Crystal Display) (70 related patents.) LCD don't emit light itself therefore a passive device called BLU(Back Light Unit)is used; when side light released from the initial light sources(CCFL or LED) passes through LGP, the light is distributed in thd overall area and diffuser sheets transform the light into a surface light source of even brightness. During this process, light efficiency decreases therefore LMS' prism sheet is essential to LCD structure for increasing brightness(luminance) of the light from the diffuser sheets and 1.5~2 times better front luminance. Optical component division produces small components components using the self-developed nation's best MRM technology.Applying the micro-stamping technology first in South Korea, we have demonstrated the capability with our products and quality by massproducing to Samsung, LG Electronics, Sanyo and Hitachi. Currently, we are manufacturing Grating for CD, DVD and BD, Liquid crystalcell,Liquid crystal cell grating, Polarized light filter multi-elements and Polarized light hologram element.
