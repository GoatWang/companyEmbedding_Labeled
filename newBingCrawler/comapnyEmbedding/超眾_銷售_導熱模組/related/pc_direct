	退換貨需知：

	1.       依照消費者保護法的規定，大潤發網路購物提供顧客商品到貨日起七天猶豫期的權益。提醒您，猶豫期並非商品試用期，如需進行退貨申請，商品必須是全新的狀態並且完整包裝。

	2.       商品申請退換貨需保持商品本體、保證書、配件(贈品)、所有隨附文件與原廠包裝的完整性，如有缺漏或毀損皆會影響自身退貨的權益，或需依照商品損毀程度進行費用的索取。

	3.       網頁商品會因為使用不同品牌螢幕以及解析度的不同，商品圖片會有些許色差，以實品顏色為主。

	4.       著作權相關之商品(如影音光碟，軟體)及耗材(電池，碳粉匣)若已拆封，則無法接受退換貨，請在拆封前決定是否要退貨；消耗性商品(如食品、內衣褲、嬰幼兒消耗品)以及商品銷售網頁上特別載明之商品，由於商品屬性特殊，有保存期限問題，無法退訂，但仍享有新品瑕疵無條件退換貨的售後服務。

	5.       如發現會員訂購後大量退換貨，而次數過多，由於會造成作業上之困擾，大潤發網路購物將會視情況對該會員採取拒絕交易或永久取消其會員資格辦理。

	6.       部分3C、家電商品，因退換貨需經廠商檢測，故處理時間可能較長(需達2周以上)，敬請見諒。

	7.       目前大潤發網路購物辦理換貨僅針對同一商品進行更換，如需更換其他商品，請先辦理原商品退貨，再重新訂購您所需要的商品。

	 

	退貨流程：

	Step 1：收到商品後，於七天猶豫期內欲辦理退貨，請您至【會員中心】>【訂單查詢】>點選訂單編號右邊的【退貨申請】

	Step 2：請輸入取件聯絡人姓名、電話及退貨訂單原因。

	Step 3：如您的發票無統一編號：請填寫隋貨附上之退貨折讓單上的品名、數量、並簽名。

	如您的發票已登打統一編號：請於退貨折讓單上蓋妥發票章或公司大小章，因折讓單上的資訊不得塗改，因此建議您，除了品名及數量以外其餘欄位請勿填寫。退貨流程辦理完畢後，將會提供發票正本及折讓單影本便於您的後續流程。

	Step 4：您申請退貨後五個工作日內，將會有客服人員與您聯繫退貨事宜，並確認退貨品項、數量。

	Step 5：請您將商品(包含配件、贈品、包裝盒等請放回原外包裝箱)妥善包裝後(切勿直接於商品上黏貼紙張或書寫文字，導致商品毀損無法再販售)，交給宅配人員，我們將於收到貨件後七至十個工作天完成退貨流程並退款至您的信用卡帳戶當中。

Directv2PC Product Serial Number








I already have Directv2PC installed on a PC and now I tried installing it on a second PC.  The installation is asking for a product serial number.  Please tell me what number it is asking for, is it asking for the serial number of one of my 2 HD receives? Thank you.

Re: Directv2PC Product Serial Number








You need to go through the download process again and fill in your email address when requested, then press the submit button and download the software (allow pop ups).  The serial number will arrive by email shortly.  Note that each address is only eligible for 2 serial numbers so if you need more use a different address.https://membership.cyberlink.com/prog/event/2008/directv2pc/enu/index.jspNote that you don't need to actually install the programs you download, but you do need to go through the motions.

Re: Directv2PC Product Serial Number








thanks, I now have it installed but am still having a problem.  After installation it found my 2 DVRs and from there I am having a problem.  I now have a problem trying to play a recording.  I get amessage that DirectV can not display  this video because  your graphics card  does not currently support screen capture protection for protected content.  Try updating your graphics card driver ormodify your driver. Anyone have a suggestion of what this means and it there is any way to get the display working (my drivers are up to date.  I am trying to run the app on a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with Windows XP Pro.

If you go to the Dell website there is a spot to put in your service code and they will list every update available for your computer.  Look for a chipset driver as well as a graphics one.  Anything involving display would be good as well.

Re: Directv2PC Product Serial Number








I updated my video driver but I have the same problem.  My laptop uses shared memory (no separate graphics card) but it is set for high resolution of 1680 x 1050 and 32 bit. Is there a requirement that a separate graphics card is required?

I had a similar issue where it said that my monitor did not support HDCP, which is not something you can update with a driver. I had to use a different monitor to make it work on that computer. Just a FYI

Re: Directv2PC Product Serial Number








The email from DTV/Cyberlink provides the "Activation Key."  The installation program asks for a "Product Serial Number."  Can I assume these are one in the same?  I need to reinstall from scratch. After a seemingly successful installation, the DTV2PC program runs as expected (checks for an update, recognizes my receiver, shows my menu of recorded shows) until I actually select a recorded program to watch - at which time the computer screen grays-out, and the program asked to be closed.   DTV2PC is currently running fine on my laptop.  It ran fine on my old desktop, but I can't get it to run on my new desktop (and, yes, I received a new Key for the new desktop),

Does not even work


            Can't play unless you buy the full version. The free version won't load the adds, so you are stuck with a blank screen.

Not What I'd Asked For


            This program is redundant for me, as I use a similar, farther reaching/larger scope connection service thru another provider. That is not the reason it gets 2 stars- I have never activated the account, nor did I download the app, however it still sits on my desktop.   I am rating it poorly therefore because I cannot seem to find the root file of this app, nor does it show up in the tradition, control panel's "program list," so I cannot take it off my PC, shut it off, or even locate the file to uninstall it manually- it hence represents dubious bloatware that I do not need, do not want, and cannot figure out how to remove from my system.  Happy to have preinstalled apps showcased on my Win10 Machine, but let me get rid of them easily if you're making me deal with them at all!!

How do you download the app if you don't have wifi?


            Why add this layer on top of hotel wifi? That at least starts up when you hit a browser. This (unless I'm missing something) requires you to download an app... which then just launches the same hotel wifi signup page.  But if you don't have the app and therefore don't have access to wifi... how are you supposed to go get it? 

Also, the FAQs look like they were typed out (maybe not even in WORD) by a school kid. Come on, Microsoft.  

And missing from anything I can find -- how much does it cost to buy wifi access?

Just wrong- takes what is offered for free and sells it


            I regularly visit a coffee shop where I can enjoy a cup of coffee, log onto the internet through their wifi that they pay for and then offer it to their clientele. 
Imagine my surprise, when I upgrade to Windows 10 and suddenly I have to download an app and pay for wifi that the coffee shop has already paid for and now Microsoft wants me to pay for again.
This is simply wrong. 
For the first time I now want to go buy Apple products exclusively. Bad move Microsoft- greedy and simply wrong

I think it is good for my brain


            I like it because it is free and the advertising is not intrusive and overwhelming. It is relaxing, enjoyable, and good brain exercise. For those reasons, I give it 5 stars.
I often change my mind as I am moving a card or stack. If I am not very careful to replace it slightly upward of exact, the cards fly to the location I have decided against, then I have to undo a move. The one thing I would change is for the game not make the decision of where the cards go.

Software that claims to boost the speed of your downloads invariably seems to disappoint, and Download Direct is no exception. The interface is straightforward and the program offers a number of customizable settings, but in our download tests, the application did not meet expectations.
When targeting the manufacturer's Web site, Download Direct performed admirably, pulling down a 3MB file in 22 seconds. But when we tried to download a 41MB MP3, the application slowed to a painful 2.2 KBps, even using the application's fastest setting. We were able to download the same file using Firefox's built-in utility in a few minutes at speeds hovering around 125 KBps. The application does provide a number of helpful options for managing and integrating downloads, although these two do not always work as expected. You can add multiple downloads at once and schedule each one; customize various interface settings, such as window position and dialog display; and choose a default download folder as well as make a list of favorite folders. The integration with the Windows Clipboard works well, with Clipboard contents automatically populating the target URL for new downloads. The browser integration works less well. Clicking on a test link for the maker's Web site sent the download command to Download Direct, but the same failed to occur with links on other sites.
Overall, we found Download Direct to be unstable as well. Running more than one download at a time consistently caused the program to crash. Users looking for a reliable download management tool would do better elsewhere.

Prosthe only good thing is that it has a scheduler
Consthe  rapidshare files downloaded could not be extracted. It shows files downloading at 1024 kB/sec eventhough my total bandwidth is 200kB/s per sec

DLD does NOT claim to be able to download RapidShare files directly without waiting. This is a common misconception.

ProsLooks great. One of the nicest looking and easiest to use DL managers I've seen.  Straight forward and very easy to use.
ConsThe speed it tells you it's downloading files at is no where near the actual kb/s dl speed. In fact, the so called download speed is at times double of my connection speed.  lol
SummaryAs I said, what this program tells you it downloads at, and what it actually DOES download at are very different!  It took me 3 hours to DL 180mb (2 files) on a 1.5MB connection yet the program download speed indicator averaged 1000 to 2000KB/s  lol. NOT. I am just finishing a 61mb download and it's taking forever. It took 2 mins just to download 1%. Id say the speed is averaging around 5kb/s, 10kb/ maximum.  Rubbish. Shame..because everything else is great but with downloads being at dialup speed, I just wouldn't ever use it again.If it gave a true speed indication, fair enough but to have it state it's downloading at 2000kb/s when it's obviously not, that just angers me. No need for the deception.As soon as it finishes downloading the current file (which is only 61mb's but I estimate it'll take about another 3/4 hour at least  to finish at this rate

ProsInterface is totally easy to use and looks great (compared to most out there). Downloaded files through IE at 120kb, but through DLD was getting 435kb. Their support is fast and friendly and an overall good company and product. Nice job SenBit... :-)
ConsNone, it's all good...
