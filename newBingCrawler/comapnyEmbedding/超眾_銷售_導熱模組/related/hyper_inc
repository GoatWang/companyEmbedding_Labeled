  公司簡介






       
                            公司成立於民國八十九年九月九日。公司主要成員具備電子系統設計、整合、與測試等方面多年之豐富專業經驗。並於民國九十一年開始，正式對臺灣，大陸地區以及全球生產藍牙產品的廠家提供產品認證之服務。
                            
                                   
                            本公司實驗室已通過中華民國實驗室認證體系(TAF/CNLA)符合ISO 17025評鑑認可並通過成為Bluetooth SIG 協會BQRB(Bluetooth Qualification Review Board)
                            認可之BQTF(Bluetooth Qualification Test Facility)，可提供全方位的藍牙認證服務。
                                   
                            本公司兩位BQE(Bluetooth Qualification Expert)--- Juei-Hsin (Jean) Chin及 Eric Wang 具多年藍牙認證作業之工作經驗，
                            除可提供客戶藍牙產品認證審查與登錄服務外，並且提供專業之藍牙認證與技術諮詢服務。
                                   
                            除了藍牙認證測試業務外，本公司並具備相關藍牙測試系統之研發能量。本公司獨立研發之藍牙射頻整合測試系統(BRITS, Bluetooth RF Integrated Test System)
                            已通得Bluetooth SIG驗證成為認可之藍牙RF Conformance測試系統，可完整涵蓋RF Conformance所有測試項目。
                                   
							本公司近期更增加了新的測試服務項目，期許能夠涵蓋多元的無線射頻測試，我們遵照 ETSI EN 301 406的標準來制定DECT 
							(Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) 及3GPP TS36.521-1 LTE RF測試環境及達到條件規範，能夠提供完整的RF
							射頻測試服務，及時提供您更有効的解決方案。
							      
							本公司始終致力於各相關技術的研發，有鑒於NFC(Near Field Communication) 近場通訊技術日漸普及運用在日常生活中，
							舉凡手機、手錶、可攜式數位遊戲機、個人電腦、數位消費性電子更廣泛應用在家庭自動化設備識別系統等，這一波NFC未來應用商機勢必掀起另一個高峰。
							      
							未來應用商機勢必掀起另一個高峰。為因應此技術潮流，HYPER Taiwan 現為NFC論壇的準會員，目前正積極與NFC-Forum申請第三方
							授權認可的測試實驗室，並積極籌備規劃於兩年內籌備完成NFC授權的測試驗證單位。

Supermicro Hyper-Speed Solutions with new Hyper-Turbo mode 







 Hyper-Speed Solutions
                Supermicro delivers world-record performance with its compute speed and memory bandwidth capabilities while providing enterprise class reliability for mission critical applications.  Built upon the X10DRU-X and X10DAX series motherboards, Supermicro is able to enhance the highest performance Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4/v3 (165W+) processors and DDR4 with its proprietary Hyper-Speed hardware acceleration technology, achieving application performance improvements up to 78% faster than the previous generation.
				X10 Hyper-Speed also introduces Hyper-Turbo mode, allowing more power to be delivered to the CPUs for intense workloads to maximize the CPU Turbo Mode frequency.  With the Low-Latency optimized SKUs, CPU frequency can be maximized indefinitely.  Without Hyper-Turbo, most workloads will see a drop in frequency within seconds.

List of memory tested at Hyper-Speed.  Low latency/jitter optimization guide here.

                





 Introducing Hyper-Speed Ultra: Industry's highest performance and most flexible server architecture
                New to the X10 generation is the Hyper-Speed Ultra platform, combining record-setting Hyper-Speed technology with the evolutionary Ultra system architecture, providing unparalleled flexibility, scalability, manageability, and serviceability.  In a dense 1U form factor, Hyper-Speed Ultra provides 4 Add-On Cards with GPU/FPGA support, while still being able to achieve 165W CPU support, and is targeted to Low-Latency Trading and High-Frequency Trading applications.  In a 2U form factor, expansion is increased to 6 Add-On cards with the ability to support 4 GPU/Xeon Phi cards, and is targeted to Remote Workstations, EDA license servers, and single-node High Performance Computing.

Hypercube, Inc. was incorporated in February of 1985 in Waterloo, Ontario. The company has origins associated with the University of Waterloo.
Its founder and current President and CEO is Neil S. Ostlund. Dr. Ostlund has held tenured academic faculty positions in the disciplines of chemistry and computer science at various universities. Most recently he was a faculty member and the director of the computer architecture lab in the computer science department of the University of Waterloo. In 1987, Dr. Ostlund left the University of Waterloo to work full-time for Hypercube, hiring its first full-time employees.
The first phase of Hypercube, Inc.'s existence involved contracting for Intel in association with Intel's development of the first commercial highly-parallel computer, the Intel iPSC hypercube computer. This is the origin of the company's name. Subsequent to this, Intel and Hypercube cooperated in the development and marketing of molecular modeling software for the commercial Intel iPSC.
The second phase of Hypercube, Inc's history involved the internal development of a turn-key molecular modeling "instrument" called a Chemputer consisting of a PC integrated with a parallel processing sub-system of Transputers running HyperChem, Release 1. A small number of these machines were built and sold to institutions such as NIH, University of California, and University of North Carolina.
The third phase of Hypercube, Inc.'s history involved a joint venture with Autodesk, Inc., initiated in 1990. Autodesk acquired an exclusive license to manufacture, market, and sell HyperChem with Hypercube doing all development and technical support for the products. The first Autodesk product, HyperChem Release 2, was shipped in March of 1992. Release 3 was shipped in April of 1993.
In January of 1994, Hypercube recovered its license from Autodesk and brought all control for HyperChem and related products in-house. Hypercube, Inc. has since shipped Releases 4, 4.5, 5, 6 and 7 of HyperChem, is currently shipping a new Release 8 of HyperChem, and has delivered other new products such as ChemPlus, HyperNMR, HyperChem Lite and Pocket HyperChem.  The company is developing a range of new molecular modeling products for a range of platforms, although its dominant product remains HyperChem for Windows. 
In the spring of 1997, Hypercube, Inc., made a major move into the US by opening a new office in Gainesville, Florida. The company purchased a 2.5-acre, 12,000 square foot site in downtown Gainesville as the location of its new office. The Gainesville office has become the principal business location for the company. Sales, marketing, and product support were all transferred to the US office.
