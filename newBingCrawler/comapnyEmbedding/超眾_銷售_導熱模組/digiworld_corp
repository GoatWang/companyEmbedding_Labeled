  DGW announces IPO price of VND52,000 per share 
Digiworld Corp (Digiworld), the IT product distributor, on Tuesday announced that its initial public offering (IPO) will be held on August 3 at the HCM City Stock Exchange with the code DGW. 
 
In a road show to introduce the company to investors in HCM City, Digiworld said the IPO would offer 23.5 million of shares at the price of VND52,000 (US$2.3).
 



 




For the first half of this year, the company announced that the CEO and his family owned 49.75 per cent of the company's stakes. Employees and key staff owned 37.06 per cent. Foreigners hold 12.56 per cent and treasury shares were 0.64 per cent.
Speaking about the growth strategy, CEO Doan Hong Viet said the company wanted to become a billion-dollar-revenue company by 2020.
To reach the goal, the company this year has continued to focus on mobile phones, laptops and tablets, and office appliances.
Next year, along with traditional business, the company will develop e-fulfillment and enterprise solutions. Expansion and distribution of other products will be continued from 2017.
Viet said that Digiworld would form joint-venture businesses with producers to ensure product supply and exclusivity of product distribution.
The company is in negotiations with network providers in the country to design packages that give customers more added value.
Co-operation with e-retailers will also be another focus in order to increase sales, Viet said.
In 2014, the company reached a net revenue growth of 59.3 per cent. The net profit rose 2.5 times compared with 2015 to VND128 billion ($6 million).

Digiworld’s Chairman: We will wholesale supplement, not retail pharmaceutical products competing with TGDĐ








        We just had a conversation with Mr.Doan Hong Viet, Chairman of the Board of Digiworld, about pharmaceutical story, the area that Digiworld and many large companies have been targeting.
      



Dear Mr.Viet, there are many electronic and mobile phone corporations embarking on pharmaceutical industry. In your opinion, is it due to the saturation of electronics which forces these companies to look for new directions?



        Every market has to mature and saturate at some point. Enterprises who want to thrive, must always actively seek for 'food sources' from 'the blue ocean', not keep competing forever in 'the red ocean'.
      

        In 2016, Digiworld (DGW) had completed its foundation to officially become a Market Expansion Service Provider. Therefore, 2017 is the time for us to expand our business, seeking for opportunity to grow with new potential market. DGW with its strengths of MES (Market Expansion Services) is confident in bringing win-win cooperation to both DGW and its partners who have good products but weak branding.
      

        According to Roland Berger's latest report in January 2017, MES Service in Asia is witnessing strong growth, particularly in Southeast Asia. Forecasted growth-rate from 2016 to 2021 reaches 8.5%. In particular, healthcare industry is growing thanks to the improvement in quality of life and health awareness, while governments also invests in health care system.
      

        According to Roland Berger, forecasted growth-rate of MES for healthcare in Vietnam from 2016 to 2021 is to reach 11.1%. Besides, FMCG is growing steadily thanks to increases in incomes, population and rising middle class in Asia. In accordance to Roger Berger, growth-rate of MES for FMCG in Vietnam from 2016 to 2021 is forecasted to reach 10.9%.
      


Sir, how much is the profit margin of supplement business? Risks in this industry?



        Estimated profit margin of this industry is over 60% (as DGW has the ability to involve in many stages in the value chain which compile high profit margin).Revenue contribution at VND 80 billion in 2017 and growth-rate is expected to reach 100%/year, target to reach VND 600 billion in revenue by 2020.
      

        The risks in this industry are as followings: Firstly, the number of users is still limited due to the the majority of Vietnamese's behavior of curing rather than preventing, although it has improved more than before. Secondly, there are difficulties in communication due to blur regulation on medicines and supplement. Thirdly, high tax rates lead to high costs. Finally, consumers are losing trust in product quality.
      


Many risks are mentioned, why Digiworld chooses pharmacy?



        Vietnam's population is huge and moving into aging progress. We are still in the stage of young population but moving fast to aging stage. Many Vietnameses have good income. I am confident to say, every family sitting here is using at least one supplement product which is not curing medicines. By the age of 30, people have signs of aging and will look for supplement products. The market is very potential.
      


Who is Digiworld's rival in the pharmaceutical market?



        DKSH is similar in term of business model but target customers are different, therefore we do not step on each other's foot. It would happen if Digiworld grows fast,but not in the coming time.
      

        Other companies such as The Gioi Di Dong do retailing, and that they could be Digiworld's customers in pharmaceutical sector. Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies are doing all sorts of things from production to distribution. Likewise, they may become Digiworld's customers if we prove that we distribute better.
      


In the extensive pharmaceutical market, what segment do you focus on?



        We focus on supplement products and over-the-counter medicines.
      


Many large companies take part in pharmaceutical market. So how does Digiworld enter into this market?



        At the moment, large pharmaceutical companies manufacture and distribute products by themselves. Small companies produce and distribute in small areas only, but not strong enough to deploy nationwide. They are Digiworld's targeted-customer. Digiworld will help them distribute nationwide. Market needs an intermediary in-between, a wide-enough distribution channel and brand marketing capabilities to be popular and distributed nationwide.
      

        Only a few domestic companies are distributing nationwide such as Traphaco, Duoc Hau Giang. Digiworld focuses on OTC market, retail market at pharmacies, not prescription. OTC's customers are quite similar to FMCG's customers: meaning that customers only make purchases after getting to know about the products, hearing the marketing message somewhere. Salesperson can explain more for them. Such quite similar to FMCG. And those are what Digiworld has. Products may be different but ways of branding marketing and organizing distribution are similar.
      

        And about the story of The Gioi Di Dong entering pharmaceutical industry, they do retail, not wholesale like Digiworld. Nationwide, there are about 45.000 pharmacies. The biggest retailer only has 40 drug stores. Comparing with cellphone, there are about 10,000 stores, The Gioi Di Dong has about 1.000 stores. Digiworld has a different angle.
      

        There are many manufacturers, they do not know how to promote their brand. That's exactly what Digiworld is aiming at. Digiworld will not open retailing stores to compete with the others as well as The Gioi Di Dong in the future. The Gioi Di Dong will always be Digiworld's customer. They are 2 supplementary pieces.
      


Whether the way DGW distributing pharmaceutical products be different from the way pharmaceutical companies are doing now?



        DGW's products are not as biopharmaceuticals like pharmaceutical companies (over-the-counter and prescription) but as supplement products and OTC medicines. Apart from pharmacy channel, DGW will also focus on other channels such as convenience stores, health-care supermarkets… and e-commerce.

Ho Chi Minh City, 27 July 2017-Xiaomi and its distribution partner DGW, today pulled the wraps off its two latest smartphones in Vietnam, the flagship Mi 6 and its newest large-screen smartphone Mi Max 2, further demonstrating its commitment to the market. This event showcases the continuing commitment to bring the Xiaomi's latest products and best service to Vietnam.
      


        Underscoring the company's 'innovation for everyone' vision, the ultra-premium Mi 6 packs a lot of punch for its VND 10,990,000 price-tag.
      

        Under the hood of Mi 6 is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 based on the cutting-edge 10nm process, raising the bar for smartphone performance once again. Coupled with 6GB of RAM, Mi 6 is set to offer even the most demanding of users all the power they need at their fingertips. An optical zoom dual camera setup means Mi 6 is able to take clearer photos of distant subjects, and portrait shots have an unparalleled background blur effect. Precisely crafted like a watch, Mi 6 seamlessly integrates four-sided 3D curved glass and a stainless steel frame.
      

        Meanwhile, the 6.44 inch Mi Max 2 is like having a mobile entertainment unit in the palm of your hand. Powered by a massive 5300mAh two-day battery, it provides up to 18 hours of video playback, meaning you could fly from Saigon to Los Angeles without missing the end of your ninth movie. While that journey is best made with your headphones on, Mi Max 2 also comes with dual speakers that intelligently activate in landscape orientation, delivering an unprecedented immersive audio experience.
      

        Donovan Sung, Director of Product Management and Marketing, Xiaomi Global, said 'Vietnam is a priority market for us and Xiaomi and Digiworld are committed to launch our latest and most innovative products here as soon as possible. Mi 6 and Mi Max 2 represent our vision to bring innovation to everyone, with top-of-the-line specifications and beautiful design, made available at amazing prices. I believe Mi fans in Vietnam will be really excited to get their hands on these devices.'
      

        The two devices announced today in Vietnam are particularly great for photo-buffs. Mi 6 comes with wide angle and telephoto lenses used to incredible effect, particularly the ability to shoot beautiful portraits with out-of-focus backgrounds. The two lenses allow Mi 6 to calculate what is in the foreground and what is in the background, creating a depth of field effect that typically requires a DSLR camera to achieve. In addition, an improved Beautify mode that makes selfies look more natural, now works with the rear camera on Mi 6. Its four-axis OIS ensures images and videos remain sharp, reducing the effect of hand-shake.
      

        Mi Max 2 hasn't been left behind in the imaging department either, equipped with the same Sony IMX386 1.25-micron large-pixel camera sensor as Mi 6 that is able to produce best-in-class photos.
      

        The line-up will once again be distributed nationwide via DGW.  Mi 6 will be available in early August both online on Lazada, as well as a range of offline distribution channels. Mi Max 2 will be available soon, with more details coming soon on Mi Vietnam's Facebook page.
      

        Mi 6 will be available in black with 6GB RAM and 64GB storage in Vietnam, while Mi Max 2 is coming in black with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage.
      

        Xiaomi's products have become a hit in Vietnam, following the company's official entry into the market in March 2016 via its partner Digiworld. Customers are recommended to ensure that the Digiworld Seal is found on the packaging of any Xiaomi device to ensure full company warranty, support, and latest updates.

It is estimated that this segment has a profit margin over 60%, contributing 80 billion VND revenue in 2017 and is expected to grow 100% / year, targeted to reach 600 billion VND in revenue in 2020.
      

        Entering into the new industry, DGW aims to  make full use of its  core competencies - as a professional provider of Market Expansion Service (MES) in Vietnam. Since  MES is not just for ICT, it is also indispensable need of every industry. Especially, with brand-new or already-on-shelfe products of good quality  but poor marketing, weak sales and lack of distribution system, MES is an urgent need for their development.

        Expected in the beginning of 3rd quarter of 2017, supplement food is the first product will be officially launched to the market through network of pharmacies in Vietnam. Also with this product, DGW will be a 'pioneer' to bring customer service when purchasing supplements or pharmaceuticals to Vietnamese consumers, DWG will collaborate with the  specialist doctors to ensure the quality as well as safety of the products, build a qualified and skilled team of consultants. Therefore, if successful, the company will continue to deploy related products.
      

        Towards the middle of 2019, DGW targets to  cover 20,000 pharmacies. There are roughly 40.000 pharmacies nationwide currently. As known, supplement food is an segment that  has high profit margin, about 60-65% (from  production line to consumer approach).
