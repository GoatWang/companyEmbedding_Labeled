RDC Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (RDC in short) was founded in 1997. It was the first company in Taiwan to focus on the design and development of IC for high-end, low power 16/32 bit microprocessors. Led by its Chairman Jana Yi, a renown figure in the industry, RDC' core management team is comprised of a group of high-tech elites with extremely rich experience in the field. With headquarter located in Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park.
Expertise in x86-compatible architecture helps RDC to deliver highly integrated and low power consumption SoC (System on Chip). Aside from developing x86-compatible CPU integrated wired and wireless technology, RDC is strengthening its competitiveness through increasing its control of key peripheral IPs and providing IAD (Internet Access Device) solution for x86-compatible embedded commercial applications.

				              The purpose of Slider Kit is to gather common slideshow-like jQuery functionalities (such as news sliders, photos galleries/sliders, carousels, tabs menus)
				            

				              When tracking mouse movement, you usually need to know the actual position of the mouse pointer. The event object that is passed to the handler contains some information about the mouse coordinates.

Company Description                    




                        RDC Semiconductor Co., Ltd. was established in 1997. Company stock issued public offering in 2002. And it began to trade at GreTai Securities Market in 2005. Compared with other domestic companies taking 16 as a starting point for MCU design, RDC is the first domestic IC design company focusing on high-frequency and energy-saving 16/32bit MCU, which results in obvious market segmentation. The majority of products are used in the areas of network, information appliance and industrial PC. Most competitors producing microcontrollers are foreign companies, such as AMD, AMD, ST and Infineon. As to the network processor IC, there are SOHO Router, Print Server and WLAN Router. In 2006, the company introduced a new product putting the CPU onto a single chip plus a DRAM, which only costs about $ 20. There are many adverse factors, such as too many competitors, price cutting to scramble for orders, pressure on product development resulted from the rapidly changing market and short product life cycles.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
