MEAT&BONE SEPARATOR
Features
Meat&bone（fish,chicken)are separated by compressing between the perforated drum and rubber belt(R7L;rubber roller). These best selling models are applicable for various processes such aspastep-roduction and chiken meat extraction.


①High yield
Efficient separation is possible due to the good infeed of our original compression system


②High quality 
Since the separated meat is immediately guided to the conveyor(or chute). it is not made into balls


③Simple to operate and easy to wash
Effective separation can be performe by simply adjusting the compr-ession handle up or down corresponding to the raw material


④Easy lubrication
An integrated lubrication system is adopted to collectively lubricate each mechanism with non-toxic oil, reducing malfuctions caused by shortage of oil.


⑤Perforation diameter
?Various perforation diameters ara available correspondingto the raw material and product (3mm～）

POTATO SKIN SEPARATOR
Features
By compressing potatoes between the perforated drum and rubber belt, the potato skin is removed 


①High yield（93～95％）
A high yield can be obtained by separating the skinsfrom boiled potatoes while compressing, making use of the diff-erence in hardness between the flesh and skin.


②Good flavor
Since the separated flesh is immediately guided to the conveyor (or chute),its original state is maintained. Furthemore,hight yield separation doesn't lose the tasty flesh just the skin.


③Simple to operate easy to wash
Effective separation can be perf-ormed by simply adjusting the compression handle to the right or left corresponding to the raw material. Since relevant parts can be simply removed after use,washing can be easily performed in a short time.
        


④Material and lubrication
As materials,stainless steel and corrosion resistant aluminum are adopted in consideration of rust prevention and sanitation. in addition, the driving mechanisms ara collectively lubricated with non-toxic oil by an integrated lubrication system, and adopted so that no oil is mixed with the flesh.


⑤Perforation diameter
Various perforation diameters ara available corresponding to the raw material and product (3mm～)
