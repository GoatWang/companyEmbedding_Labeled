Team Young. 2015 AAU Adirondack TKD Championship
Based out of Liberty, New York, Team Young is a nationally competitive and nationally recognized Tae Kwon Do martial arts team. Team  Young is led by head instructor, Master William D. Young, Jr., a 5th Dan Black Belt and former national champion himself. Our athletes train 5 days a week in Chang Hon Forms and WTF-style Olympic Sparring and compete locally, regionally and nationally.
At the 2014 AAU Tae Kwon Do National Championships in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, 22 of our athletes claimed a total of 23 medals including 5 National Champions. Team Young was the most successful TKD team from the entire state of NY (out of 22 competing clubs). In addition, as a team, Team Young placed Second in the entire country in Forms Competition and, as a result of their remarkable performance at Nationals, 2 of our black belts were invited to attend Team Trials in September for a chance to make the AAU National Cadet Team. Out of 141 athletes attending Team Trials, 2 of them were from Team Young. In a sport made up of hundreds of teams and thousands of athletes nationally, these achievements are significant and cannot be understated.
Our motto is that “Winning is a habit.” Our students, who currently range in age from 5-17, work every day at that habit and our results have already begun to show.
Team Young’s continuing mission is to train elite athletes and make them as competitive as possible on a national and international stage. In order to fulfill that mission, we are organized as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization (we are an affiliate club of the Amateur Athletic Union, Inc. (AAU)) and we fund raise throughout the year to afford our athletes the best chance to win and to come home with an increased sense of pride and confidence and the feeling of having accomplished something that matters.  If you wish to support Team Young, we’d ask you to visit our Contact Us page and reach out for ways to help further our mission.
As we digest last season and set our sights to 2014-15, Team Young’s future is limitless and our potential for success knows no bounds. One thing we know for certain, when the Yellow and Black enters the competition floor, people WILL KNOW Team Young has arrived and that they have reason to worry.  We are Team Young. Its time to Shine!

Hi Mr. Young
Not sure if you remember me or not.. Amelia Fleischhauer….I trained with Master Klee .  Sandy said she got in touch with you a while back.  She just moved back to NY.  I had told her that I had tried to find you on facebook with no luck. Of course I am not computer savvy so you may be there and I was just not able to find you.  I was in NY last year and stopped in to see Hector Jimenez at the do jang and even worked out with them,  I so sore the next day I thought I had just taken a black belt test. I liked them on FB so get to see pics of the kids there and their training.
I am on FB and my pic is a steelers logo if you are on there.  Please tell your parents and sister I send my best. I sure do miss the good old days of doing patterns and sparring.
