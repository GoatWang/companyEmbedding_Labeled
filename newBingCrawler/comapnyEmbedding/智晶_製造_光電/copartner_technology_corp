In a marketing, a product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need.[1] In retailing, products are called merchandise. In manufacturing, products are bought as raw materials and sold as finished goods. A service is another common product type.
Commodities are usually raw materials such as metals and agricultural products, but a commodity can also be anything widely available in the open market. In project management, products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that make up or contribute to delivering the objectives of the project. In insurance, the policies are considered products offered for sale by the insurance company that created the contract. In economics and commerce, products belong to a broader category of goods. The economic meaning of product was first used by political economist Adam Smith.[citation needed]
A related concept is that of a sub-product, a secondary but useful result of a production process.
Dangerous products, particularly physical ones, that cause injuries to consumers or bystanders may be subject to product liability.

Product classification[edit]
A product can be classified as tangible or intangible. A tangible product is a physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product that can only be perceived indirectly such as an insurance policy. Services can be broadly classified under intangible products which can be durable or non durable.
By use[edit]
In its online product catalog, retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company divides its products into "departments", then presents products to potential shoppers according to (1) function or (2) brand.[2] Each product has a Sears item-number and a manufacturer's model-number. Sears uses the departments and product groupings with the intention of helping customers browse products by function or brand within a traditional department-store structure.[3]
By association[edit]
A product line is "a group of products that are closely related, either because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets, or fall within given price ranges."[4] Many businesses offer a range of product lines which may be unique to a single organization or may be common across the business's industry. In 2002 the US Census compiled revenue figures for the finance and insurance industry by various product lines such as "accident, health and medical insurance premiums" and "income from secured consumer loans".[5] Within the insurance industry, product lines are indicated by the type of risk coverage, such as auto insurance, commercial insurance and life insurance.[6]
National and international product classifications[edit]
Various classification systems for products have been developed for economic statistical purposes. The NAFTA signatories are working on a system that classifies products called NAPCS as a companion to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).[7] The European Union uses a "Classification of Products by Activity" among other product classifications.[8] The United Nations also classifies products for international economic activity reporting.[9]
The Aspinwall Classification System [10][11] classifies and rates products based on five variables:

Replacement rate (How frequently is the product repurchased?)
Gross margin (How much profit is obtained from each product?)
Buyer goal adjustment (How flexible are the buyers' purchasing habits with regard to this product?)
Duration of product satisfaction (How long will the product produce benefits for the user?)
Duration of buyer search behavior (How long will consumers shop for the product?)

The National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP)[12] developed a commodity and services classification system for use by state and local governments, the NIGP Code.[13] The NIGP Code is used by 33 states within the United States as well as thousands of cities, counties and political subdivisions. The NIGP Code is a hierarchical schema consisting of a 3 digit class, 5 digit class-item, 7 digit class-item-group and an 11 digit class-item-group-detail.[14] Applications of the NIGP Code include vendor registration, inventory item identification, contract item management, spend analysis and strategic sourcing.

Product model[edit]
A manufacturer usually provides an identifier for each particular type of product they make, known as a model, model variant, or model number (often abbreviated as MN, M/N or model no.). For example, Dyson Ltd, a manufacturer of appliances (mainly vacuum cleaners), requires customers to identify their model in the support section of the website.[15] Brand and model can be used together to identify products in the market. The model number is not necessarily the same as the manufacturer part number (MPN).[16]
Because of the huge amount of similar products in the automotive industry, there is a special kind of defining a car with options (marks, attributes), that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle. A model of a car is defined by some basic options like body, engine, gear box and axles. The variants of a model are built by some additional options like color, seats, wheels, mirrors, trims, entertainment and assistant systems etc. Options, that exclude each other (pairwise) build an option-family. That means, that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option. This kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal Boolean Algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator.[17] Sometimes, a set of options (car features) are combined to an automotive package and are offered by a lower price. A consistent car definition is essential for the production planning and control in the automotive industry, to generate a master production schedule,[18] which is the fundamental for the enterprise resource planning.
In addition, a specific unit of a product is usually (and has to be) identified by a serial number, which is necessary to distinguish products with the same product definition. In the case of automotive products it's called the Vehicle Identification Number VIN, an international standardized format.

^ When an online Sears customer goes to the "Parts and accessories" section of the website to find parts for a particular Sears item, the "model number" field actually requires a Sears item number, not a manufacturer's model number.

About Chaintech Graphics Cards


Chaintech has partnered with Colorful to provide separate
graphics card brands for NVIDIA and AMD chips. The two brands have been No. 1 in
market share in China's discrete graphics card market since 2002. Product
strategy is based on developing products targeted at different user segments. 


A variety of overclocked editions has been developed for high-end users and these cards have set new records in overclocking
competitions on many occasions. Innovation was also emphasized with the
development of proprietary "Silver Plating PCB", "One Key
OC" and "Bio-mimetic Fan" technologies that have built up a
strong following among
high-end users. 


Dedicated models were developed for Internet cafes and enterprise users that emphasized low
RMA rate, high compatibility and excellent stability. Customization services
are also available for enterprise users. Examples include the development of
ultra-slim graphics card for medical use and multi-display graphics cards for
surveillance and TV monitoring. Chaintech's ODM graphics cards for Colorful are
now No. 1 by market share in China's Internet cafe market and custom
graphics cards from Colorful are gaining increasing acceptance among industrial users as well. 


Graphics cards that offer a better cost vs.
performance ratio have been developed for general consumers. These graphics
cards have proven very popular with customers due to their guarantee of quality
workmanship and reasonable pricing. 














































































 


About Chaintech Mainboards


        The strong partnership that Chaintech and Colorful
enjoys with Intel and AMD has led to
the release of
mainboards based on Intel and AMD chipsets. Colorful mainboards are currently
ranked 4th by market share in China and the current marketing strategy is based on targeting each user segment with a different set of
features. 


        For high-end users, the selling point
is high-quality workmanship, materials and extreme CPU
overclocking. The mainboards, marketed alongside high-end graphics cards, have won countless awards from
the media and has attracted a loyal following. 


        Distinct models have also been
developed for Internet cafe users and have their own product support. Chaintech mainboards' market share in
China's Internet cafe market is now growing rapidly, and the collaboration with
graphics cards is also becoming closer as well. 

        For general users, Chaintech strives to be the No. 1 choice for DIY installations
through good cost to performance ratios.












































































































 










About Chaintech Graphics Card
Distributors and Marketing


        Our alliance with Colorful is limited to market development only. At the channel level, Chaintech is
trying to consolidate the mainboard and graphics card markets while pushing for
greater differentiation between NVIDIA
and AMD graphics card products.
This move is intended to maximize market share and identify partnership opportunities. Both online and traditional channels are now being
used. 


        The online distribution channel
includes online distributors and e-commerce platforms. Online
distribution mainly consists of C2C+B2C sales through
Taobao. Taobao.com's total transaction
value exceeded 1 Trillion RMB in 2012, while graphics card sales in 2012 also increased by an average of 40%.
JD.COM generated transactions of more than 70 Billion RMB in 2012 with graphics card sales increasing at
the same rate as
Taobao.com, demonstrating the
increasing importance of e-commerce in China. Chaintech has leveraged Colorful to set up
an online sales framework with reasonable
controls put into place to avoid any conflicts between the online and traditional channels. 


        Traditional channels have been affected by e-commerce but only to a limited extent.
We have now worked with Colorful to set up more
than 300 core channel stores in major cities throughout China. By adjusting
the relationship between online and offline channels, we have identified and
taken advantage of the best features of both to maximize our market share. In 2012, Chaintech and our sales partner
saw our sales in traditional channels grow by 30%. 

        With regards to marketing, we are continuing to work closely with the local and foreign media and have won more
than 1000 media awards. Advertisements
aimed at large computer retailers, road shows, campus events, product training courses and overclocking
competitions have generated massive
user participation. New marketing tools
such as Weibo, WeChat and online
multimedia are also being used for user interaction as part of our efforts to

Cycle of research and development


Research and development (R&D, R+D, or Rn'D), also known in Europe as research and technological development (RTD), is activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product.
R&D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models[citation needed] of an R&D department either staffed by engineers and tasked with directly developing new products, or staffed with industrial scientists and tasked with applied research in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit,[citation needed] and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment. However R&D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketization of new products.

Background[edit]
New product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others.
A system driven by marketing is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell.[citation needed] Market research is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential niche market of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.[citation needed]
In general, research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company, or can be out-sourced to a contract research organization, universities, or state agencies.[citation needed] In the context of commerce, "research and development" normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in science or technology, using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yield.[citation needed]
Statistics on organizations devoted to "R&D" may express the state of an industry, the degree of competition or the lure of progress.[citation needed] Some common measures include: budgets, numbers of patents or on rates of peer-reviewed publications. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are continuously maintained, public and reflect risk.[citation needed]
In the United States, a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called "R&D intensity".[citation needed] A high technology company, such as a computer manufacturer, might spend 7% or a pharmaceutical companies such as Merck & Co. 14.1% or Novartis 15.1%. Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as engineering company Ericsson 24.9%, or Allergan a biotech company, tops the spending table with 43.4% investment[1] Such companies are often seen as credit risks because their spending ratios are so unusual.[citation needed]
Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs, like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals, scientific instruments, and safety-critical systems in medicine, aeronautics or military weapons.[citation needed]The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues.[citation needed] That is, gross profits will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only.[citation needed]
On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of amortizing the high overhead.[citation needed] They often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications, specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic designs and mechanical subsystems.[citation needed]
Research from 2000 has shown that firms with a persistent R&D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&D investment program.[2]
Business[edit]
Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, higher R&D spending does not guarantee "more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share".[3][full citation needed]
Research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention.[4] One way of reducing the uncertainty of researching know-hows is to obtain already researched know-hows.[5]
Benefit by sector[edit]
In general, it has been found that there is a positive correlation between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors, but that this positive correlation is much stronger in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms.[6][7] In research done by Francesco Crespi and Cristiano Antonelli, high-tech firms were found to have "virtuous" Matthew effects while low-tech firms experienced "vicious" Matthew effects, meaning that high-tech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while low-tech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition, even if not put to good use.[8] While the strength of the correlation between R&D spending and productivity in low-tech industries is less than in high-tech industries, studies have been done showing non-trivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by low-tech R&D.[9]
Government expenditures[edit]
United States[edit]
President Barack Obama requested $147.696 billion for research & development in FY2012. A large part[quantify] of this spending was devoted to basic research on the mechanisms of disease.[10] Yet, government-funded research that paid for the work in discovering the human genetic code (DNA) has patent-restrictions.[citation needed]
European Union[edit]
Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is open to participation worldwide.[11]
A notable example is the European environmental research and innovation policy,[when?] a multidisciplinary effort to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire value chain of human activities.[12]
