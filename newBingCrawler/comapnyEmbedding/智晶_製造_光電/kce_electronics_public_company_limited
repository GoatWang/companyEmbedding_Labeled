Background
The founding member of the KCE Group is KCE Electronics Public Company Limited. The company was originally known as Kuang Charoen Electronics Company Limited and commenced operations in 1983. In 1988, KCE Electronics became a public company listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Our core business is the production and distribution of custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), manufactured from copper clad laminate under the KCE trademark. KCE’s pcb products are used in a wide variety of applications including automotive, industrial, computer, and telecom systems. Our customers include the world’s biggest names in automotive and electronics manufacturing.
 

The KCE Group adheres strictly to TS 16949 and IPC standards. In addition KCE can create customized programs to address each individual customer’s specific requirements. Today, the KCE Group includes 4 separate manufacturing concerns: KCE Electronics, KCE Technology, and KCE International, all involved in the production of PCBs, as well as Thai Laminate Manufacturing Company which produces raw materials.


Why we won?
The customer saw the facts about Linx’s lowest running costs before the trial. The cost calculator was used to show them the facts. Linx 7300 performed without any stoppages or breakdowns.

	KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd operates in the Electronic components sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd with three other
	manufacturers of electronic components in Asia:
		
	Shenzhen Txd Technology Co Ltd
	
		of China
		(2016
	sales of 2.80 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$416.33  million]
		of which 100%
		was Optoelectronic Devices and other Electro),
	
	Tovis Co Ltd
	
		of South Korea
		(454.45 billion Korean Won [US$405.83  million]
		of which 115%
		was Display), and
	
	Shenzhen Liantronics Co Ltd
	
		which is
		
		based in China
		(2.80 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$416.68  million]
		of which 42%
		was Digital Marketing).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd reported sales of 13.80 billion Thai Bahts (US$414.34 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
				an
			
			increase of 10.8%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 12.45 billion Thai Bahts.
	
		This was the fourth straight year of sales growth at KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd.
	
		Sales of Printed Circuit Board saw an increase
		
			of
		11.2% in 2016, from
		12.11 billion Thai Bahts to 13.46 billion Thai Bahts.
		
			Not all segments of KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd experienced an increase in sales in 2016:
			sales of Prepreg and Laminate Business fell 5.8% to 55.91 million Thai Bahts.
			
				(However, this segment's sales were only a very small portion of the company's overall sales).
			KCE Electronics Public Co Ltd also experienced decreases in sales in
						Chemical Business (down 0.3% to 278.64 million Thai Bahts)
