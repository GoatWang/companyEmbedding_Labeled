Product Detail Information

Bisphenol-A(BPA) is a white, solid chemical produced by recombining phenol and acetone catalyzed by hydrochloric acid. BPA also referred to as 2,2-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl) propane and Diphenyolpropane, has a structure which makes it suitable as a monomer to rpoduce polycarbonate, epoxy, phenolic, polyester and other resins. Used directly as arm additive, it improves the stability of many other resin systems. The presence of two hydroxyl groups at opposite ends of the BPA molecule permits unhindered reaction with a variety of other chemicals under reasonably mild process conditions Health and safety information is available through the appropriate Material Safety Date Sheet(MSDS).   TEST ITEM﻿ UNITSPEC. RESULTS TEST METHOD  WATER WT.% 0.05 ASTM D1364  COLORAPHA MAX 1010  ASTM 4789 MOLTEN COLORAPHA   MAX 30 30 KPB-QC2-520  PHENOLMG/KG  MAX 1008 KPB-QC2-520   O.P-BPAMG/KG MAX 1000 190KPB-QC2-520   BPXMG/KG  MAX 500 20KPB-QC2-520  BPA PURITYWT.%  MAX 99.099.93 KPB-QC2-520   ASH MG/KG MAX 1000 ASTM D482  IRON MG/KG MAX 1.00.100  ASTM E394 FREEZ.POINT 'C MIN 156.2 156.7ASTM D4493

Company Profile



				              The purpose of Slider Kit is to gather common slideshow-like jQuery functionalities (such as news sliders, photos galleries/sliders, carousels, tabs menus)
				            

				              When tracking mouse movement, you usually need to know the actual position of the mouse pointer. The event object that is passed to the handler contains some information about the mouse coordinates.
