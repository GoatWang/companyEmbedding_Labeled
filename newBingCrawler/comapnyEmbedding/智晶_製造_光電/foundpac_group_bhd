PETALING JAYA: FoundPac Group Bhd, en route to a listing on the Main Market on Dec 29, is expected to raise RM21.6mil which will mainly be used to purchase new machineries and finance its overseas expansion. Under the listing exercise, 40 million shares of 54 sen each will be made available, comprising 18.5 million new shares for the public, 10.5 million new shares for eligible directors, employees and business associates as well as 11 million new shares for application by way of private placement to identified investors.The existing shareholder of FoundPac will undertake an offer for sale of 92 million shares by way of placement of 55 million shares to identified investors and 37 million shares to bumiputra investors.FoundPac established its operations in 2005, and together with its subsidiary companies are principally involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of precision engineering parts namely stiffeners, test sockets, hand lids and related accessories. While locally based, the group’s products are exported for the most part to various international markets primarily in Europe and the US, with the US market constituting almost 73.0% of FoundPac’s sales in FYE2016. The group has worked with a number of well-known established electronic companies over the years, including Broadcom Corp, which is a US fabless semiconductor company.FoundPac chief executive officer Lee Chun Wah said this was a testament to the efforts of the team at FoundPac as well as its business partners, listing advisers and the regulatory authorities that the company has reached this point in its listing exercise. “It has been a long and challenging journey, so it is extremely satisfying to see all our hard work come to fruition. The proceeds from a successful listing will help drive the next phase of the group’s growth, and strengthen our business as a whole. I am both excited and delighted therefore, to welcome potential investors to be a part of this new chapter in our corporate history as we pursue an active expansion blueprint,” he said in a statement yesterday. Lee said that in light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, he believed the time was right to take advantage of FoundPac’s established track record. “We want to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California in the US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices. Concurrently, we plan to strengthen our current capabilities through the setting up of a dedicated design and evelopment team which will be focused on product development. To further stabilise our revenue generation the Group is also looking to diversify our customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry,” said Lee. In its prospectus, FoundPac intends to allocate about RM8mil from the proceeds of the public issue to fund our acquisition of new equipment for its operationsIt also plans to allocate approximately RM4mil from the proceeds of the public issue to defray the cost to be incurred for setting-up our sales office in Milan and California in the next two years. Additionally, the group proposed to allocate RM3.6mil for working capital requirements.

FoundPac eyes RM21m from IPO
admin | December 14, 2016
 

PETALING JAYA: Engineering parts maker FoundPac Group Bhd, which launched its prospectus yesterday, aims to raise RM21.6 million from its initial public offering (IPO) involving 40 million new ordinary shares of 10 sen each at an issue price of 54 sen per share.
A sum of RM8 million will be used for the purchase of property, plants and equipment, while the balance, RM3.6 million will be used as working capital, RM3 million for design and development efforts and RM4 million will be to fund the group’s overseas expansion plans. 
FoundPac and its subsidiaries fabricate and supply precision engineering parts, namely stiffeners, test sockets, hand lids and related accessories that are sold to semiconductor manufacturers and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies or for printed circuit board design houses or fabless semiconductor companies which are used to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits.
Although it is locally based, its products are exported to various international markets primarily in Europe and the US, with the latter constituting almost 73% of its sales in FY2016.






“In light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, I believe the time is right to take advantage of FoundPac’s established track record, to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California, US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices,” FoundPac CEO Lee Chun Wah said in a statement.
He said it plans to strengthen its capabilities via the setting up of a dedicated design and development team focused on product development. The group also aims to diversify its customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry.
“The proceeds from a successful listing will help drive the next phase of the group’s growth, and strengthen our business as a whole. I am both excited and delighted therefore, to welcome potential investors to be a part of this new chapter in our corporate history as we pursue an active expansion blueprint,” Lee said.
The 40 million public issue shares comprise 18.5 million shares which will be offered to the public by way of balloting and which 50% will be set aside for bumiputra investors; 10.5 million shares for subscription by eligible directors, employees and business associates/persons who have contributed to the group and 11 million shares to be placed out to identified investors.
In addition, FoundPac’s major shareholder FoundPac Holdings Sdn Bhd will undertake an offer for sale of 92 million shares by way of placement of 55 million shares to identified investors as well as 37 million shares to bumiputra investors approved by the International Trade and Industry Ministry.
FoundPac is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM199.8 million upon listing on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia, based on the IPO price of 54 sen. The closing date of the IPO is Dec 19, 2016 and the tentative listing date is Dec 29, 2016. 
TA Securities Holdings Bhd is the principal adviser, sole underwriter and placement agent for the IPO exercise.

However, the IPO was relaunched at a sharply lower price of RM6.50 - versus the initial RM8.00 - and at a 23% lower volume of offered shares (524.22 million shares) following lukewarm global investors’ appetite.Of the three projects to be funded by the proceeds, only the one requiring the biggest expenditure will see reduced funding - the integrated petrochemical facility.The project’s allocation will now be RM2.59bil.Based on the original plan, the facility will comprise a cracker plant as well as polyolefins, olefins and deruvatives plants to be built on 99.16ha near its exiting plants in Indonesia.“The company confirms that the change in proceeds is not expected to materially affect the company’s ability to fund the development and construction of the integrated petrochemical facility,” it said.Lotte Chemical shares declined by 6 sen to RM6.27 at the close of Monday’s trading, with 3.656 million shares changing hands.Source: The Star ... See MoreSee LessPhotoView on Facebook·SharePAKAR SAHAM IPO Anda 1 week ago IPO Market Sees Resurgence.KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s initial public offering (IPO) market is off to a good start in 2017, with 10 companies going public in the first half, compared with 12 for the whole of last year. Companies across all business sectors are returning to Bursa Malaysia, thanks to a recovery in oil prices and an improving economy.The 10 listings in the first half of the year raised RM717.82 million in total, accounting for 71% of the RM1.09 billion raised in 2016.Despite the market’s recovery, investment bankers are of the view that the market is still missing larger, high-quality IPOs that drive activity and volume.According to Affin Hwang Asset Management head of equity strategies and advisory Gan Eng Peng, the IPO market was the poorest last year, since the 2008 global financial crisis.“So, the current IPO pipeline looks healthy in that sense, despite concerns over tighter liquidity in the system,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.“However, the overall sense is that there is still a lack of large, high-quality IPOs in the local market. While the quantum of IPO activity might be higher this year, the overall supply of high-quality, must-buy names is limited,” he noted.Eng Peng believes that the presence of high-quality names would spur the local market as it broadens choices for investors and also attracts international investors, as opposed to low-quality listings.The listing of Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd (LCT) earlier this month raised RM3.77 billion, making it the biggest IPO since 2012. Eco World International Bhd was the second biggest, having raised RM2.58 billion from investors.AmInvestment Bank Bhd executive vice-president Gan Kim Khoon pointed out that most of the upcoming IPOs for the balance of the year are relatively smaller in size.“Save for one food and beverage operator, which is slated to list in the second half of 2017, the other IPOs in the pipeline are relatively small in terms of offering size and are also predominantly ACE Market listings,” he said.While interest and participation have been healthy from both institutional and retail investors so far this year, Kim Khoon highlighted the recent listing of LCT, which saw the issuer cut its offering size and IPO price.LCT’s IPO could not attract enough investor interest, which resulted in it having to lower the price to RM6.50 from RM8 and the size of its public issuance cut to 25.13% of its enlarged share capital of 2.3 billion shares, from 30% initially. It was initially aiming to raise gross proceeds of RM5.9 billion.It also saw the retail portion of its shares undersubscribed at 61.87%, with its share price closing below its IPO price on its maiden trading day.RHB Investment Bank Bhd chief executive officer Robert Huray said LCT’s performance does not reflect the overall health of the IPO market.“LCT’s recent IPO should not be viewed as a harbinger of future Malaysian IPOs. The said IPO encountered many challenges, but we do not believe market depth or liquidity was a major cause.“A cursory view of the large IPOs in recent years indicates that the market had the ability to absorb IPOs that were larger than LCT’s. This included Felda Global Ventures [Holdings] Bhd’s RM9.9 billion IPO and IHH Healthcare Bhd’s RM6.6 billion IPO,” he said.Huray added that these IPOs were completed a few years ago, and the pool of liquidity has continued to grow since then amid Malaysia’s high savings rate.Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong concurred, pointing to the listings prior to LCT’s this year, such as Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd’s and Advancecon Holdings Bhd’s, which were oversubscribed.“Advancecon had a better take-up rate. If LCT’s performance was due to low interest from the market, then Advancecon would not have done as well, so that reason (poor IPO health) is not valid,” he said.Wong expects to see more listings in the second half of the year, adding that the IPO performance in 2017 is generally expected to be better than in 2016.Of the 10 companies that have gone public this year, five were trading at a discount to their offer prices last Friday.Going forward, all eyes are on the potential listings of Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam — reportedly aiming to raise up to US$500 million (RM2.14 billion) — and Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd.“Like all investments, it is hard to generalise if they will do well or not as each needs to be looked at from their own perspective of quality and price,” said Affin Hwang’s Eng Peng.Source: The Edge Financial Daily. ...

However, the IPO was relaunched at a sharply lower price of RM6.50 - versus the initial RM8.00 - and at a 23% lower volume of offered shares (524.22 million shares) following lukewarm global investors’ appetite.Of the three projects to be funded by the proceeds, only the one requiring the biggest expenditure will see reduced funding - the integrated petrochemical facility.The project’s allocation will now be RM2.59bil.Based on the original plan, the facility will comprise a cracker plant as well as polyolefins, olefins and deruvatives plants to be built on 99.16ha near its exiting plants in Indonesia.“The company confirms that the change in proceeds is not expected to materially affect the company’s ability to fund the development and construction of the integrated petrochemical facility,” it said.Lotte Chemical shares declined by 6 sen to RM6.27 at the close of Monday’s trading, with 3.656 million shares changing hands.Source: The Star ... See MoreSee LessPhotoView on Facebook·SharePAKAR SAHAM IPO Anda 1 week ago IPO Market Sees Resurgence.KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s initial public offering (IPO) market is off to a good start in 2017, with 10 companies going public in the first half, compared with 12 for the whole of last year. Companies across all business sectors are returning to Bursa Malaysia, thanks to a recovery in oil prices and an improving economy.The 10 listings in the first half of the year raised RM717.82 million in total, accounting for 71% of the RM1.09 billion raised in 2016.Despite the market’s recovery, investment bankers are of the view that the market is still missing larger, high-quality IPOs that drive activity and volume.According to Affin Hwang Asset Management head of equity strategies and advisory Gan Eng Peng, the IPO market was the poorest last year, since the 2008 global financial crisis.“So, the current IPO pipeline looks healthy in that sense, despite concerns over tighter liquidity in the system,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.“However, the overall sense is that there is still a lack of large, high-quality IPOs in the local market. While the quantum of IPO activity might be higher this year, the overall supply of high-quality, must-buy names is limited,” he noted.Eng Peng believes that the presence of high-quality names would spur the local market as it broadens choices for investors and also attracts international investors, as opposed to low-quality listings.The listing of Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd (LCT) earlier this month raised RM3.77 billion, making it the biggest IPO since 2012. Eco World International Bhd was the second biggest, having raised RM2.58 billion from investors.AmInvestment Bank Bhd executive vice-president Gan Kim Khoon pointed out that most of the upcoming IPOs for the balance of the year are relatively smaller in size.“Save for one food and beverage operator, which is slated to list in the second half of 2017, the other IPOs in the pipeline are relatively small in terms of offering size and are also predominantly ACE Market listings,” he said.While interest and participation have been healthy from both institutional and retail investors so far this year, Kim Khoon highlighted the recent listing of LCT, which saw the issuer cut its offering size and IPO price.LCT’s IPO could not attract enough investor interest, which resulted in it having to lower the price to RM6.50 from RM8 and the size of its public issuance cut to 25.13% of its enlarged share capital of 2.3 billion shares, from 30% initially. It was initially aiming to raise gross proceeds of RM5.9 billion.It also saw the retail portion of its shares undersubscribed at 61.87%, with its share price closing below its IPO price on its maiden trading day.RHB Investment Bank Bhd chief executive officer Robert Huray said LCT’s performance does not reflect the overall health of the IPO market.“LCT’s recent IPO should not be viewed as a harbinger of future Malaysian IPOs. The said IPO encountered many challenges, but we do not believe market depth or liquidity was a major cause.“A cursory view of the large IPOs in recent years indicates that the market had the ability to absorb IPOs that were larger than LCT’s. This included Felda Global Ventures [Holdings] Bhd’s RM9.9 billion IPO and IHH Healthcare Bhd’s RM6.6 billion IPO,” he said.Huray added that these IPOs were completed a few years ago, and the pool of liquidity has continued to grow since then amid Malaysia’s high savings rate.Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong concurred, pointing to the listings prior to LCT’s this year, such as Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd’s and Advancecon Holdings Bhd’s, which were oversubscribed.“Advancecon had a better take-up rate. If LCT’s performance was due to low interest from the market, then Advancecon would not have done as well, so that reason (poor IPO health) is not valid,” he said.Wong expects to see more listings in the second half of the year, adding that the IPO performance in 2017 is generally expected to be better than in 2016.Of the 10 companies that have gone public this year, five were trading at a discount to their offer prices last Friday.Going forward, all eyes are on the potential listings of Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam — reportedly aiming to raise up to US$500 million (RM2.14 billion) — and Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd.“Like all investments, it is hard to generalise if they will do well or not as each needs to be looked at from their own perspective of quality and price,” said Affin Hwang’s Eng Peng.Source: The Edge Financial Daily. ...

PETALING JAYA: Engineering parts maker FoundPac Group Bhd, which launched its prospectus yesterday, aims to raise RM21.6 million from its initial public offering (IPO) involving 40 million new ordinary shares of 10 sen each at an issue price of 54 sen per share.
A sum of RM8 million will be used for the purchase of property, plants and equipment, while the balance, RM3.6 million will be used as working capital, RM3 million for design and development efforts and RM4 million will be to fund the group’s overseas expansion plans. 
FoundPac and its subsidiaries fabricate and supply precision engineering parts, namely stiffeners, test sockets, hand lids and related accessories that are sold to semiconductor manufacturers and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies or for printed circuit board design houses or fabless semiconductor companies which are used to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits.
Although it is locally based, its products are exported to various international markets primarily in Europe and the US, with the latter constituting almost 73% of its sales in FY2016.
“In light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, I believe the time is right to take advantage of FoundPac’s established track record, to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California, US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices,” FoundPac CEO Lee Chun Wah said in a statement.
He said it plans to strengthen its capabilities via the setting up of a dedicated design and development team focused on product development. The group also aims to diversify its customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry.
“The proceeds from a successful listing will help drive the next phase of the group’s growth, and strengthen our business as a whole. I am both excited and delighted therefore, to welcome potential investors to be a part of this new chapter in our corporate history as we pursue an active expansion blueprint,” Lee said.
The 40 million public issue shares comprise 18.5 million shares which will be offered to the public by way of balloting and which 50% will be set aside for bumiputra investors; 10.5 million shares for subscription by eligible directors, employees and business associates/persons who have contributed to the group and 11 million shares to be placed out to identified investors.
In addition, FoundPac’s major shareholder FoundPac Holdings Sdn Bhd will undertake an offer for sale of 92 million shares by way of placement of 55 million shares to identified investors as well as 37 million shares to bumiputra investors approved by the International Trade and Industry Ministry.
FoundPac is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM199.8 million upon listing on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia, based on the IPO price of 54 sen. The closing date of the IPO is Dec 19, 2016 and the tentative listing date is Dec 29, 2016. 
TA Securities Holdings Bhd is the principal adviser, sole underwriter and placement agent for the IPO exercise.

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 28): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, stocks in focus on Thursday (Dec 29) may include: APM Automotive Holdings Bhd, Borneo Oil Bhd, Econpile Holdings Bhd, Scientex Bhd, Gas Malaysia Bhd, FoundPac Group Bhd and Solid Automotive Bhd.APM Automotive Holdings Bhd is penetrating into the Internet of Things (IoT) market via the acquisition of a 52% stake in Omnimatics Sdn Bhd for RM625,000. APM’s unit Auto Parts Holdings Sdn Bhd had on Dec 2 inked a subscription agreement with Raj Kissu Rajandran and Watchtower & Friends Sdn Bhd, resulting in Omnimatics becoming a subsidiary of Auto Parts Holdings.Omnimatics was set up by Raj Kissu as a tech startup to develop its flagship product, CARdio — an IoT telematics platform that connects cars to the cloud, to make day-to-day driving a better and safer experience through information awareness.On the rationale for the acquisition, APM said the emergence of IoT applications embedded in automobiles, both the automobile industry insiders and everyday drivers would lead to an increase in connectivity, productivity and ability to perform diagnostics, while on the move.Borneo Oil Bhd’s net profit for its third financial quarter ended Oct 31, 2016 (3QFY16) more than tripled to RM21.6 million, from RM5.26 million a year earlier, attributed to revaluation gain of RM35 million in its investment properties.Revenue rose to RM950.44 million, from RM23.96 million. But it was down 9.26%, compared with the preceding quarter’s revenue of RM1.05 billion, mainly due to a quieter gold trading and investment climate.The fast-food & franchise division, meanwhile, posted lower revenue of RM12.08 million in 3Q, from RM13.66 million in the preceding quarter (2Q).The company opened three Sugarbun and four Pezzo franchised outlets during the quarter, bringing their total number to 89 and 48 respectively.The mining, energy & related operations division posted lower revenue of RM937.33 million versus the preceding quarter of RM1.033 million. The trading/investment division purchased 5,426.8 kg of gold and sold 5,508 kg of gold during the quarter, leaving a closing inventory of 836.34kg.“The mining activities produced 13.015kg of gold during the same period,” it said.Its other divisions, namely its head office and the property, management & operation divisions, contributed immensely in this current quarter, mainly through a revaluation exercise carried out in October 2016 of its investment properties, which registered an overall increase in the fair value of RM35 million.Econpile Holdings Bhd, along with its joint venture partner China Communications Construction Co (M) Sdn Bhd (CCCC), has clinched a RM389.07 million contract to undertake foundation, substructures and other ancillary works for Package SUKE-CA3 of the Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) project.Econpile’s wholly-owned subsidiary Econpile (M) Sdn Bhd (EMSB) and CCCC received a letter of award dated Dec 22, 2016 from Gabungan Strategik Sdn Bhd for the proposed project.Based on the pre-bidding arrangement, the scope of work will be divided among EMSB and CCCC in a 40:60 ratio.Under the contract, EMSB’s portion of work amounts to RM158.27 million, out of the total contract sum of RM389.07 million awarded to CCCC and EMSB. The contract is valid for 17 months.Scientex Bhd is purchasing two pieces of land measuring 121.1967 acres in Kulai, Johor from Singapore-based Lee Rubber Co (Pte) Ltd for RM123.64 million cash.The proposed acquisition will lift Scientex's total landbank up to 2,400 acres, which will keep it busy for the next 10 to 15 years.Scientex said its wholly-owned subsidiary Scientex Quatari Sdn Bhd has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with oil palm estate owner Dahlia Utama Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned unit of Lee Rubber, for the proposed acquisition.The proposed development, the group said, will enable the company to tap on operational efficiencies and generate better margins through economies of scale to be achieved during project implementation."The land is proposed to be developed into a mixed property development. However, it is currently too preliminary to ascertain the exact total gross development value, development cost, the expected commencement and completion dates of the development and the expected profits to be derived from the development of the land," said Scientex.Scientex has ongoing projects worth RM1.6 billion at the moment, consisting mostly of five townships in Johor (Pasir Gudang, Kulai, Skudai, Senai and Pulai) and a mixed development in Melaka.Gas Malaysia Bhd announced that an Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) framework will be used to fix the natural gas base tariff for the non-power sector in Peninsular Malaysia, for a three-year period from Jan 1, 2017.Under the framework, the company would allow changes in the gas costs to be passed through via the Gas Cost Pass Through (GCPT) mechanism, every six months.A unified base rate for natural gas of RM26.71/mmbtu (million British Thermal Units) will be charged across all categories in the first half of 2017, before being increased to RM28.05/mmbtu in the second half.In 2018, the base rate will be increased to RM30.90/mmbtu in the first half and further raised to RM31.92/mmbtu in the second half.For 2019, the base rate will be raised to RM32.69/mmbtu in the first half and RM32.74/mmbtu in the second half.Gas Malaysia said that residential consumers will be charged RM19.26/mmbtu for the first half of 2017. In comparison, the existing tariff is RM19.52/mmbtu.Public IB Research has valued FoundPac Group Bhd, which is set for listing on the Main Market, at 63 sen.FoundPac began its operations in precision engineering parts trading in May 2005. Over the years, the group extended its business to include design, development and manufacturing activities, catering to semiconductor companies in North America, Europe and Asia.It also plans to expand its production capacity through the acquisition of new machines, diversification of its customer base to include end-user industries and setting up of more sales offices overseas.Solid Automotive Bhd's net profit almost halved to RM1.37 million or 0.82 sen a share in the second financial quarter ended Oct 31, 2016 (2QFY17), from RM2.72 million or 1.65 sen a share a year ago, due mainly to lower gain on foreign exchange and the higher inventories written down in the current quarter.Revenue fell 2.1% to RM32.54 million in 2QFY17, from RM33.22 million in 2QFY16.For the cumulative six months (6MFY17), Solid Automotive's net profit dropped 39.7% to RM2.52 million or 1.52 sen a share, from RM4.18 million or 2.59 sen a share in 6MFY16; while revenue rose by a marginal 1% to RM62.17 million, from RM61.55 million.On prospects, Solid Automotive said it will continue to focus on strategies for sales and marketing in both domestic and export market, to promote its in-house brands and expand its product range."The group will continue with improvements to enhance our supply chain management, productivity and cost management. The group will strive to maintain its performance for the financial year ending April 30, 2017," it added.
