金屬鋁基材箔
        因為鋁基板導熱係數與散熱能力比一般金屬基板更好，以鋁基板作為印刷電路板基板材質的散熱PCB可以擁有較佳的導熱性、電氣絕緣性能和機械加工性能亦可強化LED產品並解決客戶擔心的散熱問題。



鋁基板(NRK鋁基板、DENKA鋁基板)特點

1.可採用表面黏裝技術（SMT: Surface Mount Technology）。
2.對於熱擴散問題可於LED燈板設計製造中做有效改善。
3.可以將LED燈板產品運行溫度較快降低，提升LED燈板產品運作效能與延長LED燈板產品使用壽命。
4.縮小LED產品體積，降低LED產品所需附加配備及LED燈板產品裝配成本。 
5.可以進行相關表面處理與拋光處理增加LED燈板產品反射效果。
6.可以取代易碎的陶瓷基板，獲得更好的機械耐久力。
