Product Detail Information
CRT Layour

The CRT component business division includes the production and sales of products such as Glass Rod, the component stand inside the electron gun that is the core element in cathode ray tubes, Glass Power that is the raw material for the Glass Rod, special Stud Pin to fix the shadow mask of the color cathode ray tube, Anode Button required for accepting high voltage and Hermetic Assembly that is the fixed ceramic series inducing the accurate emission of electrons inside the electron gun through the development.
For the cathode ray tube display device, Phoenix is actively penetrating into the market by developing the new technologies in accordance with rapid growth of LCDs since 2000 and emergence of new display devides such as organic ELs. Moreover, with the continous increase of demands around the developing countries such as China and India, it is expected that the market demand will be kept to the current level in the fugure.
The cathode ray tube components of Phoenix PDE are the essential parts of the cathode ray tube and produced only by Phoenix PDE in Korea on the basis of its unique technology development. The cathode ray tube components play the substantial roles in enabling the Korean CRT makers to dominate the markets as surging past the foreign CRT makers as well as replace the imported goods.
Furthermore, on the basis of the technological lead, Phoenix supplies the components to most global CRT makers such as Ashai, NEG, SONY and HITACHI of Japan, CPT (China Picture Tube) of Taiwan and Thomson of France and most products from Phoenix are dominating the largest market shares in the global markets.
