Since 1938, FENWAL has been dedicated to providing their clients 
                with solutions for, industrial temperature 
                controlling, thermal sensing and control equipment. With its customer

                excellent performance in the most demanding applications.
Temperature 
                Controllers: 
Among 
                the variety of FENWAL, there are 3 main varieties: The AR44L digital 
                range, the AR24L and the economical FM range. The table below 
                gives a brief overview of the three.

As 
                can be noticed, the AR44L is a very dynamic product. Further, 
                the AR24L is very similar to the AR44L model but has a smaller 
                size.

                HS FENWAL digital temperature indicator is very versatile and

                that can be measured is 0 to 1200C. When Pt 100 sensors are used, 
                the range can either be 0 to 400C or -100 to +100C.
