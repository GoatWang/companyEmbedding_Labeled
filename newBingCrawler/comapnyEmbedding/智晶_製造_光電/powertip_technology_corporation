Powertip Technology Corporation, established in 1991, began operation by instituting time-honored ideals that still largely guide this company today.  Powertip continues to reinforce the principles of being a leading display manufacturer to industry. Powertip consistently strives to uphold exceptionally high standards concerning technology and product development while remaining deeply attentive to quality, on-time delivery and remaining highly price competitive.  
Powertip has grown to become a leading manufacturer of small to mid-size full color TFT and monochrome displays as well as resistive and capacitive touch panels. Powertip is headquartered in Taichung, Taiwan with production facilities located in Taiwan and Nanjing, China. Powertip’s product offerings address major industries to include medical, industrial, automotive, consumer, white goods, telecommunications and point-of-sale (POS).
Powertip’s manufacturing capabilities comprise Surface Mount Technology (SMT), Chip-On-Board (COB), Chip-On-Glass (COG), Chip-On-Flex (COF), Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) and screen printing. Production of a typical LCD panel would require Powertip to take Mother Glass, scribe, cut, fill the cells with liquid crystal and then seal the two sandwiched glass panels. Powertip would then add polarizers, color filters and all other required backend manufacturing processes to create a completed LCD module to specification.
To assist customers, Powertip has designed an ARM based HMI control board to expedite and shorten product development lead times. To meet customer demands, Powertip has developed an STN/VATN LCD module technology with in-cell touch capabilities, a one-glass-solution (OGS) capacitive touch panel and implemented highly discerning touch panel technologies that offer water proofing and use when wearing gloves.
Powertip’s vision is to create “Display Devices for Advancing Technology” by remaining diligent, enthusiastic and innovative when designing and developing the ideal visual and touch solution for our valued customers. Powertip’s talented and experienced R&D and manufacturing teams work tirelessly to provide products that meet or exceed customer expectations.

Powertip Technology Corporation, established in 1991, began operation by instituting time-honored ideals that still largely guide this company today.  Powertip continues to reinforce the principles of being a leading display manufacturer to industry. Powertip consistently strives to uphold exceptionally high standards concerning technology and product development while remaining deeply attentive to quality, on-time delivery and remaining highly price competitive.  
Powertip has grown to become a leading manufacturer of small to mid-size full color TFT and monochrome displays as well as resistive and capacitive touch panels. Powertip is headquartered in Taichung, Taiwan with production facilities located in Taiwan and Nanjing, China. Powertip’s product offerings address major industries to include medical, industrial, automotive, consumer, white goods, telecommunications and point-of-sale (POS).
Powertip’s manufacturing capabilities comprise Surface Mount Technology (SMT), Chip-On-Board (COB), Chip-On-Glass (COG), Chip-On-Flex (COF), Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) and screen printing. Production of a typical LCD panel would require Powertip to take Mother Glass, scribe, cut, fill the cells with liquid crystal and then seal the two sandwiched glass panels. Powertip would then add polarizers, color filters and all other required backend manufacturing processes to create a completed LCD module to specification.
To assist customers, Powertip has designed an ARM based HMI control board to expedite and shorten product development lead times. To meet customer demands, Powertip has developed an STN/VATN LCD module technology with in-cell touch capabilities, a one-glass-solution (OGS) capacitive touch panel and implemented highly discerning touch panel technologies that offer water proofing and use when wearing gloves.
Powertip’s vision is to create “Display Devices for Advancing Technology” by remaining diligent, enthusiastic and innovative when designing and developing the ideal visual and touch solution for our valued customers. Powertip’s talented and experienced R&D and manufacturing teams work tirelessly to provide products that meet or exceed customer expectations.
