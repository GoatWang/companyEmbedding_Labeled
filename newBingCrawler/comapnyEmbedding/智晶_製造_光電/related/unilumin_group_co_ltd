UNILUMIN UPAD III
The Most Advanced LED Panel Yet
The new Unilumin Upad III LED Panel is built using a strong, reliable, light-weight magnetic frame with “tool-free” locks that allow for a single engineer to assemble, disassemble, or swap out panels. The modules are also rear accessible, allowing quick replacement in a permanent installation environment. The UPAD III also features a climbable panel structure, and supports both concave and convex curve installations.

Maintenance.
So Easy One Person On Your Team Can Do It
Unilumin’s New UPAD III LED Panel is built using a strong, reliable, light-weight magnetic frame with “tool-free” locks that allow for a single engineer to assemble, disassemble, or swap out panels. The modules are also rear accessible, allowing quick replacement in a permanent installation environment.








Sustainability.
The Latest Technology To Stand The Test of Time
The Upad III offers a pixel pitch variety ranging from 2.6mm to 6.9mm. This means that a viewer would have to be within 2-6 feet of the LED panel to notice the slightest degradation in image quality.  For a viewing distance of larger than 2 feet, the Upad III offers superior HD resolution and a mega-high refresh rate of up to 3840 Hz. Both combine to produce absolutely stunning image performance.










  




Flexibility.
Change Your Stage or Give It Curves, With No Tools Required.
Unilumin’s Upad III LED Panel features patented angle block technology, allowing curvature up to 10% concave and 5% convex, as well as unmatched versatility in a live-stage environment.  Its climbable panel structure makes assembly and disassembly fast and efficient, and without the need for tools. Owners can easily adapt their stage set-up on their own.
