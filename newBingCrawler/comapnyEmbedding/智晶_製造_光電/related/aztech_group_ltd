Press - Aztech adsl products - Aztech Group Ltd - InvestorAztech’s ADSL Products Successfully Completed TR-067 Conformance Testing AT UNH-IOL SINGAPORE, 18 August 2005 - Aztech Systems Ltd, a global leader in data and voice communication products, recently conducted interoperability testing based on the DSL Forum’s TR-067 at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory’s (UNH- IOL) ADSL Consortium. TR-067 specifies ADSL bit-rate and distance requirements beyond those previously specified for ADSL recommendations, and reflects the recent improvements in ADSL modem performance at a time when an increasing number of DSL customers are getting service at 3 Megabits and faster. TR-067 defines a consistent testing and reporting environment that enhances the reliability of test results, leading to lower deployment costs for service providers, better equipment support and a myriad of consumer product choices to better serve individual needs. “We are pleased that our ADSL modems have completed DSL Forum's TR-067 testing, thereby confirming their high performance capability. The UNH InterOperability Lab is renowned for its role in testing and certifying various kinds of networking equipment," stated Michael Mun, CEO and President of Aztech Systems Ltd. He added, "It provides us with an independent platform to reinforce our commitment to quality. As a member of the UNH-IOL consortium, Aztech will continue to be at the forefront of industry standards to ensure that our products meet or exceed the approved standard." The UNH-IOL is one of the networking industry’s premiere independent proving ground for new technologies. The UNH-IOL provides leading-edge facilities and support for group tests (or “plugfests”) and technology forums devoted to nearly every facet of networking. The UNH-IOL houses more than 32,000 square-feet of laboratory space with 60 testing stations offering a spectrum of power, copper and fiber cable options, telephone and Internet connectivity, and rack and table space. The laboratory’s rigorous, vendor-neutral testing is performed through independent, focused interest groups called consortiums, composed of member companies solving interoperability issues in a given technology. Standards-based debugging and interoperability testing in the laboratory’s extensive test bed can often result in significant improvements and reduced R&D time and costs associated with product development. The organization provides detailed test results confidentially to participants, with general reports made public in a generic format.Page 2: Aztech ADSL Products that completed
