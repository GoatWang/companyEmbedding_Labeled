Why choose Displays2go as your B2B merchandising & marketing product supplier?


Point of Purchase Displays:  POP and POS merchandising tools and accessories are designed to attract maximum retail customer attention while making the most efficient use of space. Displays2go offers point of sale fixtures ranging from simple shelf talkers to free-standing cash wrap configurations with locking cases. Our physical merchandising displays are appropriate for stores, vendors, and goods of any size, from branded fixtures with integrated signage to simple cardboard countertop stands. 
Marketing Display Products:  Communication with customers and advertising to attract potential clients are key elements of any commercial business plan. Displays2go.com offers a wide variety of fixtures and accessories that help boost company or brand recognition in any environment.  Stock and custom graphics and banners, brochure holders, poster frames and hangers, digital signage stands and mounts, and interactive messaging kiosks are only a sampling of the many advertising display accessories available for sale on our site. 
Trade Show Merchandising Displays: Businesses across all industries attend off-site promotional and sales fairs, conventions, and events. Customized trade show booth accessories and fixtures are a great way to increase customer attraction in high traffic areas. Displays2go’s wide selection includes all-in-one exhibits, indoor and outdoor flags, digital and electronic signage, folding tables, and portable counters. Our focus is on quality, affordability, durability, and portability, and many customized items are manufactured in-house for the fastest possible turnaround and shipping times.  
Facilities Furnishings & Accessories: Schools, hotels, conference halls, arenas, churches, clubhouses, and similar establishments understand the specialized needs of shared facilities.  Our selection of speaking podiums, reception furniture, charging stations, and commercial-grade accessories are designed to withstand heavy use by the public on a daily basis. In addition, many of our display products offer “fast-change” designs that allow graphics and messaging to be changed quickly and easily, perfect for accommodating changing advertising, groups, speakers, or presentations. 
Commitment to Excellence:  Every member of the Displays2go.com team is dedicated to providing top quality service and merchandise to our customers.

 Huge Selection of Trade Show Display Products


As one of North America’s largest display product suppliers, we offer a complete range of booth fixtures and accessories.  We recognize that event furniture needs can vary widely, from weekly or monthly promotions for some companies, and annual industry trade shows for others.  Our selection of exhibit stands and booths includes everything from simple pop-up counters to modular, branded point of purchase promotional exhibits with integrated print and digital signage displays. In addition, various designs allow custom-printed trade show displays to accommodate specialized needs, from presentation-based marketing to direct sales to advertising collateral holders designed to increase consumer awareness.  Our in-house purchasing and manufacturing departments are constantly adding new lines, brands, and styles to ensure that our event marketing furniture and accessories keep up with changing customer needs.  In addition, our in-house manufacturing team is dedicated to constantly improving both our service and our capabilities. Cutting edge equipment such as flat-bed UV printers allow us to offer increased branding and customization options without significantly impacting order turnaround. Displays2go.com is dedicated to providing quality production and fast shipping, even on custom-branded items, so that displays arrive as quickly as possible. 


 Point of Purchase Displays for Retail Store Merchandise


Displays2go understands that POP and POS display products are a key element of commercial and retail product merchandising success.  From modular base configurations such as slatwall, and gridwall fixtures to portable countertop risers, our huge selection is designed to meet the needs of stores, brands, and retailers in every market.  In addition to point of purchase checkout counters, stands, and accessories for showcasing retail products and advertising or marketing collateral, we offer an extensive collection for specialty merchandising.  Industry-specific displays include locking cases for jewelry and high-end merchandise, sunglasses racks, chip strips and spinners, illuminated product display boxes, and clothing mannequins.  Customers can browse the different styles, finishes, and options to find the perfect match for décor, inventory, or budget concerns.

Marketing Display Products for Business or Retail Use




Product display marketing needs to accommodate more than simply merchandise. Advertising and sales collateral such as brochures, posters, flyers, and even signage can all be integral to increasing customer awareness and satisfaction. Even facilities furniture such as presentation stands, podiums and lecterns have an impact on operations and the bottom line. Our wide selection of brochure holders, sign frames, and furnishings come in a full range of sizes and styles. Many items include custom branding options, such as digital, UV, and silkscreen printing for high visibility logos, messaging, or graphics. In fact, many of our customized displays, including our entire Workshop Series line of fixtures and accessories, are manufactured and printed in-house in order to reduce lead times.

Key Features Matrix AND PANEL CHARACTERISTICSUV resistant polycarbonate shell and waterproof module design with silicon / epoxy filling for outdoor application. Easy to install with front or rear maintenance mechanism. High precision CNC housing design. Automotive industry standard coating and rust prevention for punishing environment conditions. Constant current driving technology setup to reduce heat generation. 1%~100% brightness levels adjustment for each R/G/B. Built-in self test pattern for easy maintenance. High efficient power factor design. CE, UL, ETL certificate approval. Custom-made design available Waterproof level up to IP65 LED color calibration In factory calibrationIn general, as a result of the LED's wide range of brightness and color, the general filtering and selection procedure cannot fully unify the LEDs brightness and color onto a display.OPTOTECH, however, has managed to bypass this challenge by developing the chromaticity measurement and correction system. This system can adjust every unit of the LED brightness and chroma and keep the difference below 5% so as to ensure optimum LED uniformity.On site calibrationWhy on-site color calibration?The imbalance in uniform brightness and color shade of display might be caused by the following reasons:• Not performing factory calibration of each module during the manufacturing process. • The maintaining, reworking or repairing of display. • LED will be polluted or decayed by environmental condition or time. Virtual pixel sharing techlologySpecific RGB LED design and accurate driver controlling technology improves the image caused by the edge-line effect. OPTOTECH's virtual pixel technology enables every LED pixel to be shared by the surrounded pixel, increasing the resolution three or four fold, hence delivering a higher quality image to the human eye. This system is an economical way of increasing resolution with a controlled number of LEDs.16 bit color depthWith the development of the driving system and gamma correction technology, OPTOTECH is able to successfully diminish the flickering and interference in the lower scale of brightness and lightness area. 16 bit from OPTOTECH is able to demonstrate more than 280 trillion colors grey scales on red, green and blue. Brightness varies from 0.08nit, 0.16nit, 0.24nit, 0.32nit. In addition, the 16 bit grey scale smoothly enhances the dim pixel image and enhances the picture quality of the display.Video processing technolotyVideo processing technology provides a complete digital image product system. Through transforming the input signals to all digitalized image data and output to the display, the technology can fully support a resolution of up to 1024 x 768 and give a 24 bit full color image. As a result of this technology, OPTOTECH has managed to create some space between itself and the competition, and effectively lead the field.
