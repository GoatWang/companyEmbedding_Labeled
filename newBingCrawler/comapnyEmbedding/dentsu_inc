      2015 was a year in which signs of change were evident. Although there 
      were some bright spots such as the emergence from deflation due to 
      rising stock prices at the beginning of the year and other factors, it 
      was also a year where uncertainty caused by cost-of-living increases and 
      concerns about future prospects created a less than favorable 
      consumption environment. The increase in inbound tourism consumption, 
      however, an example of which is binge shopping by Chinese and other 
      foreign tourists, had a considerable impact on Japan’s consumption 
      figures, and this is also reflected in this year’s hit product rankings.
    

      Binge shopping / inbound tourism, which took first place in this year's 
      rankings, drew attention to the Chinese New Year (also known as the 
      Spring Festival) holiday which was celebrated in February. Through the 
      mass media’s frequent reports on the buying of Japanese products by 
      foreign tourists on their holiday trips, attention was also drawn to 
      other holidays celebrated by people of other nationalities, such as the 
      National Day of the People’s Republic of China, and this media coverage 
      had a significant impact on the Japanese public. As their eyes were 
      drawn to the binge shopping by inbound tourists, the Japanese people 
      rediscovered the charm of Japan and once again focused on local 
      products, as can be seen in the No. 7 ranking for the Hokuriku 
      Shinkansen and the No. 9 ranking for the hometown contribution tax 
      system, which enables people to make a donation to the local or 
      prefectural government of their choice and receive gifts of regional 
      products in return.
    

      The second equal ranking shared by tennis player Kei Nishikori and the 
      Japan National Rugby Team’s performance at Rugby World Cup 2015 shows 
      the Japanese public’s surprise at and admiration for their world-class 
      performances in areas where Japan felt that it was facing a big wall. It 
      can be said that with each success on the world stage, there were many 
      people who gained courage as they saw how their athletes competed 
      outside of Japan.
    

      The following “2016 Expected Hit Products” list was compiled using the 
      products selected for the “It has been popular this year / It is popular 
      now.” category as a base and then focusing on those selected for the “It 
      will become popular.” category.

Promotions



Promotions, driven by the digital environment, are a major objective of establishing a broad range of customer experiences related to purchasing activities. With the growing diversification of products and services, it becomes increasingly difficult to motivate customers to make purchases through product appeal alone. Moreover, end-user needs are becoming more individualized amid the consumer-to-consumer exchange of large amounts of information.
In response to these advances, Dentsu creates promotional organizations offering plan-do-check-act (PDCA) and other specific measures that clearly demonstrate return on investment. We go beyond intelligent in-store communications to provide expertise in social networking systems (SNSs), online videos, smartphones and other devices, as well as online-to-offline (O2O) commerce-related tools and other optimized digital solutions.
Our efforts focused on activation ideas matching target tastes and creative elements that enhance the value of customer experience each year garner numerous awards from around the world.
We also excel at space-branding techniques leading to next actions by providing a deeper and more dramatic impression of experience value.
We maximize the value of those customer experiences and purchasing behaviors that contribute to marketing return on investment, thereby ensuring that Dentsu Group promotions will continue to evolve.
Two new companies "Dentsu Live Inc. " and "Dentsu Tec Inc. " established on January 4, 2017
