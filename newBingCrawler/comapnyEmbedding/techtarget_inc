Its IT Deal Alert is a suite of products and services for IT vendors that leverages the detailed purchase intent data that it collects about end-user IT organizations. Through scoring methodologies, it uses this data to help its customers identify and prioritize accounts whose content consumption around specific IT topics indicates that they are in-market for a particular product or service. It also uses the data directly to identify and further profile accounts' upcoming purchase plans. Its IT Deal Alert includes IT Deal Alert: Qualified Sales Opportunities, IT Deal Alert: Priority Engine, IT Deal Alert: Deal Data and IT Deal Alert: TechTarget Research. Qualified Sales Opportunities is a product that profiles specific in-progress purchase projects, including information on scope and purchase considerations. Priority Engine is a subscription service by its Activity Intelligence platform, which integrates with salesforce.com. The service delivers information to allow marketers and sales personnel to identify accounts researching new technology purchases, and to reach prospects within those organizations that are relevant to the purchase. IT Deal Alert: Deal Data is a customized solution for sales intelligence and data scientist functions within its customers that makes its Activity Intelligence data directly consumable by the customer's internal applications. TechTarget Research is a subscription product that sources information about purchase transactions from IT professionals making and have recently completed these purchases. The offering provides data on market trends, pricing dynamics and vendower win/loss and displacement trends. Its Core Online offerings enable its customers to reach and influence prospective buyers through content marketing programs designed to generate demand for their solutions, and through display advertising and other brand programs that influence consideration by prospective buyers.The Company's suite of demand solutions offerings allows IT vendors to manage return on investment (ROI) by capturing qualified sales leads from the distribution and promotion of content to its audience of IT professionals. Its demand solutions campaigns offer the Activity Intelligence Dashboard, a technology platform that gives its customers' marketers and sales representatives a real-time view of their prospects, which includes insights on the research activities of technology buying teams, including at an account level. Demand solutions offerings may also include an additional service, TechTarget Re-Engage, which helps both technology marketers and their sales teams to identify active prospects, detect emerging projects, retarget interested buying teams and accelerate engagement with specific accounts. Its demand solutions offerings may also include the White Papers, Webcasts, Podcasts, Videocasts and Virtual Trade Shows, and Content Sponsorships.White papers are technical documents created by IT vendors to describe business or technical problems, which are addressed by the vendors' products or services. In a program that includes demand solutions, it posts white papers on its relevant Websites and its users receive targeted promotions about these content assets. Prior to viewing white papers, its registered members and visitors supply their corporate contact information and agree to receive further information from the vendor. The corporate contact and other qualification information for these leads are supplied to the vendor in real time through its lead management software. Webcasts, podcasts, videocasts, virtual trade shows and similar content bring informational sessions directly to attendees' desktops and mobile devices. As is the case with white papers, its users supply their corporate contact and qualification information to the Webcast, podcast, videocast or virtual trade show sponsor when they view or download the content. Sponsorship includes access to the registrant information and visibility before, during and after the event. IT vendors, or groups of vendors, pay it to sponsor independent editorially created content vehicles on specific technology topics where the registrant information is then provided to all participating sponsors. In some cases, these vehicles are supported by multiple sponsors in a single segment, with the registrant information provided to all participating sponsors. Because these offerings are editorially driven, its customers get the benefit of association with independently created content, as well as access to sales leads that are researching the topic.The Company's suite of brand solutions offerings provides IT vendors exposure to targeted audiences of IT professionals actively researching information related to their products and services. It leverages its Activity Intelligence product framework to allow for significant segmentation and targeting of audiences that are accessed through these programs. Components of brand programs may include On-Network Branding, Off-Network Branding and Microsites. On-Network Branding offerings enable its customers to influence prospective buyers through display advertising purchased on the Websites it operates. Programs may include specific sites, or audience segments across its sites. Its Off-Network offerings allow its customers to influence prospective buyers through display advertising when they are visiting other Websites on the Internet. It identifies audience segments that can be targeted based on their activity and demonstrated interests against its content and Websites, and offer an array of audience extension and retargeting solutions that leverage Activity Intelligence. It has a range of solutions that create stand-alone Websites for IT vendors, or embedded Websites that exist within the context of its existing Websites. It creates white papers, case studies, Webcasts or videos to its customers' specifications through its Custom Content team. These customized content assets are then promoted to its audience within a demand solutions program. The Company operates a select number of face-to-face events, the majority of which are free to IT professionals and are sponsored by IT vendors. Attendees are pre-screened based on event-specific criteria, such as sector-specific budget size, company size or job title. It offers over three types of events, including multi-day conferences, single-day seminars and custom events. Multi-day conferences provide independent content provided by its professionals to its attendees and allow vendors to purchase exhibit space and other sponsorship offerings that enable interaction with the attendees. It also holds single-day seminars on various topics in major cities. The Company competes with United Business Media, QuinStreet, International Data Group, and CBS Interactive/ CNet.
