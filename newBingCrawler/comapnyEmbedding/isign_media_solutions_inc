History[edit]
iSIGN was founded in 2006 by Alex Romanov, who has served as president, chief executive officer and director for the company. iSIGN began as a digital signage company offering location-based proximity marketing from signs to handheld mobile devices. It went public in 2009 on the TSX Venture Exchange, then began trading on OTCQX under the symbol “ISDSF” in June 2012. Following an agreement with Mac’s Convenience Stores,[4] iSIGN reportedly became the world's largest interactive digital signage network with 6,000 digital signs in over 1,400 locations.[5] ISIGN reports identifying 1.5 million mobile devices per day.[6]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2013, the company's chief executive officer was Alex Romanov.[2]
Business Model[edit]
The company is acting to shift "traditional advertising to mobile" through "engaging an actionable audience and delivering measurement of that action".[3]
Technology[edit]
iSIGN’s Interactive Media Solutions (IMS) mobile messaging product consists of a proprietary IMS 2.0 platform as well as an IMS 3.1 version featuring dual porting for Linux or Windows, multi-lingual capabilities and 128-bit encryption software for security.[7]
The Smart Antenna, rolled out in 2012, uses the same Bluetooth technology as the IMS but also has WiFi capabilities to connect with iPhone users, broadening mobile messaging capabilities. Smart Antennas have a 300-foot (100m) Bluetooth message broadcasting and WiFi accessible content transmission radius. iSIGN’s patent-pending platform collects and organizes metrics and delivers customizable analytics[8] to merchants while protecting consumer privacy.[9][10]
iSIGN launched a Smart Player in August 2013, the first product of its kind that combines digital signage with mobile messaging capabilities via wireless connectivity. The Smart Player is designed to distribute marketing messages to mobile and stationary devices within range of its location.[11][12]
Customers and Partners[edit]
Canada[edit]
iSIGN Media customers include Mac's Convenience Stores and Couche-Tard outlets (from 2012),[2] and the BC Sports Hall of Fame in Vancouver, British Columbia.
United States[edit]
Smart Antennas have been installed in several Florida cities, including Safety Harbor, Dunedin,[13] Orlando and Clearwater. In 2012, Smart Antennas were installed in the New Orleans tourist attraction Mardi Gras World.[1]
Partnerships and Licensees[edit]
Partners include: AOpen America Inc., TELUS, Keyser, and IBM, with solution distribution by BlueStar Inc. iSIGN holds licensing and distribution agreements with GraphicMedia.

					of  350-500 Smart Antennas  in 35 hospitals in the State 
					of Victoria in Australia and the roll-out into the remaining 
					7 States of up to 4000 Smart Antennas  going forward, we 
					have decided to raise iSIGN's target price to $1.00 per 
					share. Once all installations are completed in every one of 
					Australia's hospitals and connected with iSIGN's security 
					device and other big data components we expect that the 
					company’s revenues will exceed 5 million dollars annually 
					from this one client.  iSIGN earns 60-70 % of all revenues, 
					due to the nature of its recurring monthly fees for data 
					management and message broadcasting against which there is 
					little cost.

iSIGN Media Solutions  is on the 
					verge of major revenue streams from different industries 
					such as shopping complexes/amusement parks and airports. It 
					is our belief that iSIGN's licensing agreement with Rich 
					Multimedia Technologies that call for 8600 Smart Antennas to 
					be integrated into their phone kiosks for installation 
					in Mexico and major airports throughout North Americas will, 
					on its own, bring about profitability to the Company.

Recently, a major North 
					American insurance company has categorized the smart antenna 
					as a safety and security device which will open new markets 
					for iSIGN especially 
					in amusement centers, malls and commercial real estate 
					projects. 

We believe with all these new and 
					exciting developments  with iSIGN's proprietary and 
					patented technology,  the stock is a very attractive 
					speculation and could trade up to $1.00 
					per share before the end of 2016. 

eHealth Consortium Group in 
					Australia Update  / June 22, 2016


					According to our reseller, JEA Technologies, eHealth 
					Consortium Group's intention is to start installations in 
					hospitals located in the State of Victoria.  
					Installations into hospitals located in the States of New 
					South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, Western 
					Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Australian Capital 
					Territory would follow later.

As advised by JEA, the State of 
					Victoria has a population of 4.6 million people and has 24 
					major government owned and operated hospitals in the 
					Melbourne Metropolitan area, as well as 11 private hospital 
					corporations.

The projected number of Smart 
					Antennas per hospital, ranges from 10 to 15, which will be 
					determined once site surveys at each hospital are completed.  
					Installations are expected to be in:  (i) each public 
					entrance, installed into the entrance's digital signage or 
					the hospital way finding kiosks (information systems that 
					guide people through a physical environment and enhance 
					their understanding and experience of the space); (ii) the 
					public food courts of the hospital's cafeteria areas; 
					(iii) the Accident & Emergency departments where there are 
					long waiting times; and (iv) public waiting areas.

The total number of Smart 
					Antennas for the 35 hospitals in the State of Victoria is 
					expected to be from a minimum of 350 to a maximum of 525 for 
					these hospitals and would increase as installations expand 
					into the other 7 States.  iSIGN revenues will be 
					derived from the sale of the Smart Antenna units as well 
					as the monthly data management/message broadcasting fees. 

Our technology and Smart Antennas 
					are being promoted to architects who are responsible for 
					interior design and hardware supply, such as digital LCD 
					signage, way finders, etc.  In the  State of 
					Victoria, the process is to work through level 1 and level 2 
					specifications and tender processes for government hospital 
					supply and system integrations.  Each hospital may have 
					different levels of procurement and capex rules, needs and 
					requirements.  

Contract length is expected to 
					vary per hospital and will range from 24 to 36 months, with 
					each contract to be renewable at the end of the initial 
					period.

 Recent 
					Developments
 In late 
					October 2015 iSIGN signed a Licensing/Original Equipment 
					Manufacturer Agreement with Rich Multimedia Technologies 
					(“RMT”) to integrate iSIGN’s Smart Antenna into RMT’s 
					Tele-Digital Store Front Kiosk (essentially a digital 
					signage kiosk).  iSIGN will receive a licensing fee based on 
					built units and will also receive a data management fee once 
					the Kiosk is activated.  The total fee per Kiosk is $3 
					US per day.  RMT is immediately constructing 5,000 
					Kiosks for Mexico (airport, transit system and government 
					offices) and has a roll-out plan for a further 3,600 Kiosks 
					into various international airports in the US and Canada by 
					the end of calendar 2016.  Based upon a $3 US per day per 
					kiosk fee, the revenue opportunity from this one 
					installation is $9.417 million annually, once all 8,600 
					Kiosks are build and activated. The profit margins are 
					 60-70 percent of revenues. Rich Multimedia Technologies  is 
					presently in five airports in the United States and is 
					presently integrating approximately 600 iSIGN's Smart 
					Antenna in all their kiosks. 
 
Through 
					iSIGN's reseller, We Build Appps, an installation 
					of approximately 500 Smart Antennas  into Crocker Park, a 
					roughly 78 acre shopping complex in Ohio, consisting of 
					retail stores, restaurants, residential apartment buildings 
					and office building is close to be signed  This complex is 
					managed by Stark Enterprises who manage a total of 16 
					properties.  The potential is for an expansion into the 
					other properties in time.
 
Technology 
					Overview

The patented 
					and proprietary technology does not involve apps and related 
					downloads in order to receive and view messages and, as 
					messages are delivered by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, is capable of 
					interacting with all cell phones including  iPhones 
					and androids.  
 
Our technology is housed 
					within hardware devices built for the commercial market; are 
					waterproof and fully tested to operate within  extreme 
					temperature ranges of -40° to +185° Fahrenheit.  Our 
					technology does not involve apps and related downloads in 
					order to receive and view messages and, as messages are 
					delivered by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, there is no cost to the 
					recipient.
 
Our current hardware units, 
					the Smart Antenna, was introduced in the summer of 2012.  
					Our previous hardware was only capable of delivering 
					messages via Bluetooth, which prevented this units from 
					communicating with iPhones, as Apple does not allow for 
					Bluetooth messaging interaction.  Our Smart Antenna, 
					which utilizes both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to communicate with 
					mobile devices, is now capable of interacting with all 
					smartphones.  
 
Our second hardware unit, the 
					Smart Player, has currently been produced in prototype only 
					and contains all the features of the Smart Antenna, while 
					adding the ability to manage content on digital screens at 
					the same time.
 
As our messaging requires the 
					recipient to accept an opt-in message prior to receiving 
					messages, we are not considered to be ‘spam’. 
 
As we ‘push’ messages, we are 
					‘pulling’ information into our back-end reporting system, 
					that allows for real-time reporting to our clients.  
					The ‘pulled’ information is completely anonymous, in that it 
					cannot in any way identify the individual that our 
					technology is interacting with.  Some of the 
					information gathered includes the make and model of the 
					mobile device; acceptance or rejection of messages;, date, 
					time and location of each interaction; and time spent within 
					range of our system.  All of which is information that 
					is considered to be ‘Big Data’ is of considerable interest 
					to users of our technology, as well as to data integrators.
 
Mission 
					Statement
To create a National and 
					International Mobile Network allowing for location-based 
					interactive proximity mobile marketing; thus providing 
					brands, stores and third party data aggregators a  data 
					mining machine that allows for trends and activity to be 
					viewed and analyzed.
 
We live in a world where our 
					mobile devices have become extensions of ourselves.  We 
					depend on them for instant connections to entertainment, 
					social media, news, and deals.  The phone has become 
					our ticket, loyalty card, and catchall wallet.  
					Networks are faster; phones are smarter and the mobile 
					shopper is ready to spend money now. 
 
Customer 
					Targeting
Our technology and products 
					can be employed across multiple channels from general retail 
					outlets to real estate.  Essentially, our technology 
					and products can be utilized wherever a seller wishes to 
					interact with shoppers in proximity to their location.  
					Our initial customer targeting is convenience stores and gas 
					stations, as this is a fast growing channel, that has over 
					150,000 locations, with approximately 126,600 linked to gas 
					stations in the US, generating in excess of $700 billion in 
					annual revenue.  The problem faced by C-store/gas 
					stations, is that 37% of their customers pay at the pump and 
					don’t step foot within the store.  Margins at the pump 
					are 5.1%, while store margins are 22.4%.  The average 
					inside sale is only $4.85.  All quoted figures taken 
					from the 2013 NACS Annual Report.   These problems 
					can easily be addressed and mitigated by using our products.
 
 
Advantage of 
					iSIGN’s Technology
Proximity 
					marketing is a very new field.  As a result, 
					comparisons of our technology and hardware to iBeacon is 
					often made, when there is really no comparison at all.  
					iBeacons are essentially an electronic QR code that requires 
					an application instead of a camera to  read it.  
					The iBeacon is not a functional device without an app and 
					infrastructure to support it, while the Smart Antenna is 
					totally self-contained.  While there are numerous 
					advantages of our system, the main one is in the setup 
					requirements:  The iBeacon system requires the user to 
					pay to develop an app for each type of phone they want to 
					address (iPhone, iPad Android (each variant of the OS and 
					device type)).  These development costs for a retail 
					operation can cost from $30,000 to $100,000.  Once an 
					app is created a database has to be created (more costs)  
					that contains the specific offers for each iBeacon location, 
					which has to be updated any time the iBeacon is relocated.  
					Then the operation must pay to develop a management system 
					to track each iBeacon’s location and maintenance schedule.  
					In contrast, for our system,  as small graphic ad needs 
					to be created and uploaded to our supplied content 
					management system.   For a more in-depth 
					comparison, go to  http://www.isignmedia.com/mobile-advertising-solution/infographic and 
					look for Smart Antenna vs iBeacon Comparison.
 Revenue 
					Streams
Our revenue is derived in a 
					number of ways: (i) licensing and OEM agreement; (ii) 
					hardware sales; (iii) monthly recurring data management 
					fees, including standard analytic reporting; (iv) data and 
					analytic sales, including non-standard analytic reporting 
					and data insight sales to data aggregators and other third 
					parties; (v) advertising  and (vi) fees for additional 
					services, such a content creation, custom integration of 
					customer loyalty data bases and additional API or software 
					development.
 
The Company expects that data 
					and analytic (‘Big Data’) sales of our mobile data to data 
					aggregators and other third parties will produce a 
					substantial portion of iSIGN’s future revenues.  The 
					Company has the opportunity to gather related data from 
					clients’ point-of-sale equipment once it completes the 
					development  of its Point-of-Sales Data Acquisition 
					(PDAQ) software.  This software will allow retailers, 
					restaurant operators, etc. with the ability to analyze 
					customer transactions and associate those transactions with 
					marketing initiatives.  It allows for the ‘closing of 
					the loop’ on consumer messaging and related purchases.  
					This will increase the value of our data insights from the 
					$0.20 level to a range of $1.40 to $2.00 per linked insight.  
					Once integrated into customers’ loyalty programs, where 
					customers’ permission-based identifications are included, 
					these insights could have a commercial value range of $3 to 
					$4 per integrated insight.  An insight is the 
					relationship of one data point with another point of data – 
					for example, the time of day that a person downloaded an 
					advertising message is an insight; the time of day and the 
					specific day of the week is another; while linking the three 
					of these would be two insights.  Note that all dollar 
					amounts are as estimated by Dr. J. Tanner of our data 
					partner Baylor University/Hankamer School of Business and 
					are in US dollars. 
  
Business 
					Model
iSIGN uses exclusive and 
					non-exclusive resellers to sell our solution to business 
					channels.  Resellers are now in place in the United 
					States; Canada; Australia; Panama; India; MENA and Eastern 
					Europe.  Negotiations are in various stages with 
					potential resellers in Western and Northern Europe; Iceland; 
					the Far East; United States; Chile and Columbia.
 
Advertising revenues are 
					presently sourced by our existing advertising staff and our 
					advertising reseller, AllOver Media, North America’s largest 
					alternative out of home platform.
