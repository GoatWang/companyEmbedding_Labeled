            LED CONTROLLERS



             




     MCA2X16 are 
            fully integrated and cheap LED controller designed for driving all 
            kind of Common Anode LED displays and single LED's. These  
            products are very easy to use, simple and flexible in design, 
            providing low count of cables , low consumption, low cost, light 
            weight and small in dimensions. This LED controller is 
            suitable for wide range of applications. LED controller provides 
            all refresh cycles and logic operations, Light Intensity Control 
            (Global Intensity) using programmable PWM control, Power Supply for 
            logic, Power Anode Drivers and Serial Channel Buffers - LED drivers. LED 
            controller drive two independent LINES. Refresh rate is 100 Hz and provide excellent, free 
            flicker views of the designed LED display. Duty cycle of refresh is 
            1 to 10, providing maximal possible light intensity for driving 
            dynamic LED displays. Simple and 
            cheap external serial driver blocks - LED drivers, provides high current for 
            driving LEDs and low count of cables and interconnections between 
            PCB boards, low power consumption and heat losses of the custom 
            designed LED displays. Internal Download - Upload Character generator 
            takes ability of the user to dump directly decimal and hexadecimal 
            values for 7 segment displays and ASCII characters and strings for 14 
            -16 segment indicators without one byte additional software. LED 
            controllers provides additional useful information about level of 
            Power supply voltage (VIN), logic supply voltage (VCC) and room 
            Luminosity value for optimal PWM adjusting. LED controller accepts two 
                types of data HEXADECIMAL and ASCII strings and characters. 
            First type is decimal-hexadecimal bytes and blocks for transmitting 
            commands and driving seven segment displays.  Second type of data is 
            ASCII characters and strings for driving 14 -16 alphanumeric segment 
            indicators. After the command is completed, LED controller sends to 
            HOST message (selectable as LITERAL or HEX) for result of operation 
            and indicate that is ready to accept new command. Simple and low count
of command set is very easy to learn and use.  
            By this way can be designed 
            variety of graphic symbols and pictures to the LED display. 
MCA2X16 
                  is multifunctional LED Display Controller supports 
			three types of interfaces using wedge type  interface boards 
                  depending of specific application. This interface boards 
                  dramatically expand connection flexibility and amount of driven LED's. As 
                  example when is used CB485 interface board can be connected to 
                  single serial channel  up to 32 Slave LED controllers 
                  MCA2X16 that can 
                  drive total amount of 81920 single LED's. Each type 
                  of 
                  interface board is recognizing automatically from LED controller and 
                  initialize peripherals requirements.

MCA2X16 uses same command set lincluding one extra 
                  command for Slave select (applicable only with
                  CB485 board).

    Selecting of LED drivers buffer 
            depends on the desired load current for selected indicators. This 
            technique enables ability of connection of different types of 
            indicators in each LINE to the same LED driver. Current for desired LED display can be 
            easily provided depending value of Input Voltage (VIN) and Technical 
            Data about Forward current for selected LED indicator using formula 
            and examples in  
            extbuf3.8.pdf. Actually each  LINE is constructed from 
            up to 16 serially connected 8 bit shift registers - LED drivers. Anodes of 
            indicators are directly connected to appropriate pins to Anode 
            connector. For more detailed information and downloads refer to

Intelligent Graphic LCD display with built-in character setsThe
eDIP displays are pre-loaded with
7 built-in fonts in different sizes (see picture). Each character set can be
enlarged 4 times their original size.  A simple command rotates text by 90° for
landscape or portrait presentation.  New fonts can be added
to the LCD display at any time with the free LCD development and simulator tools. Any Windows™ font
already in the Windows font folder can be imported to the display. New character sets such as
Cyrillic, Arabic or Chinese easy included. 

Rotating or Needle
Instrument commands
The EA eDIPTFT32-A, EA
eDIPTFT43-A, EA eDIPTFT57-A and EA eDIPTFT70-A displays have commands to design
rotary (gauge) or needle pointing instruments. User can adjust picture, colours,
text, scale and pointer rotation. Instruments can be linked directly to the
analogue port, touch-screen or LCD interface. 

The EA eDIPTFT57 and EA eDIPTFT70 can draw a virtual keyboard on the display with a simple command Esc K S. When a key is pressed, data is send to the display interface. Keyboard font, button colour, background and borders can be adjusted to match the your design.
 
The EA eDIPTFT57 and EA eDIPTFT70 have an amplifier on board the display with connection for an 8 ohm speaker. With simple commands jingle or sounds messages can be played. 

Powerful commands speed-up development time More then 112
easy to learn commands such as: define touch key area with menu
function, clipboard, bar graph, centred strings, copy bitmap, clipboard, zoom, flash, wait, beep, backlight on/off
... allow you to create the screen layout you require. All the commands are based on
coordinate specifications and can therefore be applied and moved to the
nearest pixel of the LCD display. There is a built-in LCD self-test facility for initial
testing and demonstration purpose. To access simply set the "Test" pin to low.
These innovative display have an extremely
space-saving design to maximizes the display viewing area. These displays
have no PCB overhang or contact pads for connectors or cables. The DIP or ZIF
connector located at the back of the display. 
These intelligent
LCD
display is simply inserted into a socket or soldered to the PCB. No screws,
spacers or cables are required, all saving time and money.  2 metal
clips
are available to secure the display in place to the PCB or bezel.  
The integrated graphics and touch controller (order with
option-TP),  built-in temperature
compensation and integrated negative supply also help to reduce the PCB
size and cost.  
LCD serial communication
ports ( RS-232, RS-485,
USB, I²C, SPI
)
The intelligent eDIP displays have
serial, I2C and SPI
interface on the display. This allows direct connection to your micro-controller.
For direct connection of the display to USB, RS232 or RS485 equipment a level converter is required. We supply serial to USB, serial to RS232 or RS485 level converters. The EVAL-eDIP development kit includes adapters for USB, RS-232 and RS-485.  
 For the EA eDIP240 and EA eDIPTFT43 we have a serial or USB interface board with socket to fit the display. This option offers integration and mounting in the end product.

State-of-the-art display technology
Only top-quality
materials are used. As a result, this display is very easy to read and
offers a high level contrast. With an extended standard temperature range of
-20..+70 °C, rapid response times are guaranteed down to -20 °C (max. 3
seconds). The essential temperature compensation is built-in. Operates
from a single 3V or +5V supply. (Check datsheet)
LCD display with integrated
touch-screen
The
display can be supplied with or without analogue touch panel.  The onboard touch-screen driver is responsible for interpretation of the touch area.  What is more, the variable grid, shape and
size and number of the keys can be modified freely. Touch-screen driver is controlled over the same display interface.  
The EA eDIPTFT43-ATC and EA eDIPTFT70-ATC is available with resistive or capacitive touch-screen (PCAP). The capacitive version is brighter and offers higher contrast.

LED Lighting Facts® Products



                    Welcome to the LED Lighting Facts Product List! 
                    The searchable list includes LED luminaires and retrofit kits with verified performance information for each product.
                

Update 12.16.2016: Due to changes in the market as well as in replacement-lamp testing requirements, LED Lighting Facts is no longer listing replacement lamps, but luminaires and retrofit kits continue to be listed. 
                
Once you have narrowed your search criteria, click on the search button. You can further refine your search by clicking on the section headers. LED Lighting Facts expanded the characteristics by which a product can be defined; manufacturers have the option of confirming a product's mounting base, subcategory, size and use location. Some products may not include all of the characteristics and therefore may not appear in a search using additional criteria. The program encourages all manufacturers to review their listed products and apply the new designations.

                    For assistance when evaluating if LED products are appropriate for a given application, see the residential and commercial performance scales.
