Murgitroyd’s team of attorneys has world-class experience across all commercial sectors.
Whether you’re a multinational corporation, university technology transfer department, law practice or start-up company, we can assemble the perfect team of specialists for your IP needs.

G Edward Murgitroyd, CEO
Our attorneys not only have scientific or technical knowledge from their first, and in many cases, doctoral degrees, but also have a commercial understanding of the way in which IP rights are used. Additionally, many have gained experience in the sectors we represent as technologists or in-house counsel or in other private practice roles before joining Murgitroyd.
Our attorneys’ breadth of expertise and experience means we understand the issues your business faces day-to-day, and truly speak your language.

Murgitroyd Group PLC

Exercise of options

RNS Number : 8195L Murgitroyd Group PLC 05 October 2016  

5 October 2016
 
Murgitroyd Group PLC ("the Group")
Exercise of Options
 
The Group announces that it has issued and allotted 4,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each ("Ordinary Shares") to an employee pursuant to an exercise of options under its unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme.
 
The new Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu with the Group's existing issued Ordinary Shares. An application for admission of the new shares to trading on AIM will be submitted and trading is expected to commence on 18 October 2016 ("Admission").
 
Following Admission, the Group's enlarged issued share capital will comprise 8,996,131 Ordinary Shares. The Group holds no shares in treasury. Therefore the total number of Ordinary Shares with voting rights is 8,996,131, which figure may be used by shareholders in the Group as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Group under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.

[Attachment] The Elevator Awards 2017 took place last Thursday (29 June) and Murgitroyd was there as proud sponsor of The Grampian Award for Innovation.
      

        The annual award ceremony, which was held at the Mercure Ardoe House Hotel, celebrates business excellence, entrepreneurial behaviour and outstanding community contributions made by top businesses in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.
      

        Murgitroyd's James Brown (Director, Patents) presented DDK Positioning with the Grampian Award for Innovation for its early-stage product which the judges said had 'the potential to be game-changing across a wide range of industries'.
      

[Attachment]DDK Positioning provides precise positioning solutions for consumer applications which can be delivered on handheld devices such as mobile phones.
      

        They beat off strong competition from RigDeluge who produce innovative solutions and products for onshore and offshore firefighting systems and Aiken Group who provide cost-effective environmental and waste water treatment solutions for both onshore and offshore industries.
      

        A video outlining all of the three finalists' solutions can be viewed here.

Murgitroyd Group PLC

Acquisition and Trading Update

RNS Number : 1329C Murgitroyd Group PLC 24 June 2016  

24 June 2016
 
Murgitroyd Group PLC 
Acquisition and trading update
 
Acquisition
 
The Board of Murgitroyd Group PLC ("the Group") announces that its principal operating subsidiary, Murgitroyd & Company Limited ("Murgitroyd"), yesterday, completed the acquisition of certain trade and assets from Dallas-based MDB Capital Group, LLC ("MDB") and Managua-registered Patentvest S.A. ("Patentvest"), including employee and client contracts of MDB's IP Software & Services Group.
 
The consideration of $2.43m, paid at completion, included the value of the tangible assets, IT systems and records, and will be part-funded through a new term loan facility with the balance funded from existing Group resources.  The transaction is anticipated to be broadly earnings neutral in its first year.  In the twelve months to 31 May 2016, MDB's IP Software & Services Group generated gross revenues of approximately $860,000.
 
US Patent Attorneys, Michael Chernoff and John Wootress, based in the USA and Nicaragua respectively, along with eighteen staff, including sixteen Managua-based Patent engineers predominantly engaged in US Patent searching, have transferred to Murgitroyd.
 
Commenting on the acquisition, Chairman of the Group, Ian Murgitroyd, said: "This acquisition reflects our strategy of offering a comprehensive suite of IP advisory and support services to global companies and international law firms in the Group's largest geographical market, the USA, with the objective of increasing Murgitroyd's market share of high value European Patent Attorney services purchased by them."
 
Mr Chernoff, MDB's Chief Intellectual Property Officer, who joins Murgitroyd as Director, IP Strategy and Portfolio Management, was previously Director of Legal Services, Patent Operations at Accenture, and also has experience as a Patent Examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Mr Wootress, Director of Intellectual Property at MDB, joins Murgitroyd as Director, IP Research and Analysis.  Prior to joining MDB, he was Deputy General Counsel for Belkin International, Inc.
 
Commenting on the opportunities arising from the transaction, Group Deputy Chairman, and Murgitroyd CEO, Edward Murgitroyd, said: "I am delighted that Murgitroyd is extending its IP support services offering through the expansion of its IP strategy and Patent searching capabilities with the addition of Michael and John, and their team, and I believe this will augment existing sales channels used to win significant, higher-margin, European Patent Attorney work."
 
Trading update
 
The Group also today announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31 May 2016.  
 
Consistent with its Interim Results announced in February, the Group has continued to see revenue growth in the second half of the financial year.  The Board therefore expects to report revenue in excess of £42m for the financial year ended 31 May 2016, and profit before taxation broadly in line with market expectations.
 
Notwithstanding the acquisition announced above it is also expected that again an increased final dividend will be recommended. 
 
Chairman
 
The announcement of preliminary annual results in September 2015 included a statement to the effect that Group Chairman Ian Murgitroyd intended to move from Executive to non-Executive Chairman.  The Board now confirms that this transition will take place with effect from the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, in October 2016.
