platform properly applied to our existing programs provides a permanent new capability that will allow us to launch a variety of marketing tactics going forward.""At minimum, mobile should be evaluated as a part of any marketing mix; for us, it enables the extension of a tailored message to our current and potential customers and turn what was a static branding platform into a link to further communication."Erik Hallstrom, CEO of Snipp noted: "It is very rewarding to work with James Hardie, which is a company aggressively exploring how mobile technology can enhance and transform
