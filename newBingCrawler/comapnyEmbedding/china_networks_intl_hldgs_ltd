AMENDMENT
NO. 2 TO
 
MERGER
AGREEMENT
 
This
Amendment No. 1 (this “Amendment”), dated as of February __, 2009, to the Merger
Agreement (as defined below) is made by and among Alyst Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (including its successors and assigns, the “Parent”), China
Networks Media Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (including its
successors and assigns, the “Company”), MediaInv
Ltd., a British Virgin Islands Business Company and Kerry Propper (each a “Principal
Shareholder,” and together with their successors and assigns from the
date hereof until the Business Combination Effective time (as defined below),
collectively the “Principal
Shareholders”) and each of the other signatories hereto. Any capitalized
term not defined herein shall have the meaning for such term specified in the
Merger Agreement.
 
WHEREAS, Parent, the Company,
the Principal Shareholders and the other signatories hereto entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2008; and
 
WHEREAS, Parent, the Company,
the Principal Shareholders and the other signatories hereto entered into
Amendment No. 1 to such Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 28,
2009 (as so amended, the “Merger Agreement”); and
 
WHEREAS, Section 2.7(h) of the
Merger Agreement sets forth the terms that govern the allocation of any future
Warrant Payments; and
 
WHEREAS, Parent, the Company,
the Principal Shareholders and each of the other signatories to the Merger
Agreement desire to clarify the terms of the means by which the Warrant Payments
shall be made to Closing Holders and Preferred Share Closing Holders on the
terms contained herein.
 
NOW THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:
 


      1.    Section
2.7(h) of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the existing
Section 2.7(h) in its entirety and replacing it with the
following:


 
(h)          Warrant
Exercise Proceeds.  In accordance with Section 2.7(a), China
Networks Surviving Corporation hereby agrees that the Closing Holders and
holders of Preferred Shares as of the Closing (“Preferred Share Closing
Holders”) shall be entitled to receive from the Company, cash payments
(the “Warrant
Payments”) equal to a maximum aggregate amount of U.S. $19,110,000 and
10% of the aggregate gross proceeds received in the Financing from the bridge
investors, respectively, solely and exclusively upon China Networks Surviving
Corporation’s receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of the Parent Warrants
and the Insider Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”), payable
in accordance with this Section
2.7(h).  The Warrant Payments shall be allocated among such
holders of Closing Holders and Preferred Share Closing Holders based on their
percentage ownership of the sum of (a) the Company Shares, or (b) the Preferred
Shares immediately prior to the Business Combination Effective Time (the “WEP Percentage
Allocations”), as the case may be.  Upon exercise of any
Warrants, as soon as practicable after receipt of the actual cash proceeds
received therefrom by China Networks Surviving Corporation (but in any event
within 10 days) (the “Cash Proceeds”),
China Networks Surviving Corporation shall make a cash payment to each Closing
Holder and Preferred Share Closing Holder equal to 66% of the Cash Proceeds then
available for distribution pursuant to the foregoing sentence multiplied
by  the WEP Percentage Allocation of such holder.  The
Company shall retain and apply to its general corporate purposes 34% of the Cash
Proceeds.  In no event shall the maximum aggregate amount payable
pursuant to this Section 2.7(h) to any
such holder exceed (x) U.S. $19,110,000 or 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds
received in the Financing from the bridge investors, as the case may be,
multiplied by (y) the WEP Percentage Allocation of such holder (which aggregate
amount, in the case of a Preferred Share Closing Holder, shall not exceed
$50,000 for each 17,500 Preferred Shares owned as of the Closing ).
 






1









 
      2.    All other
provisions of the Merger Agreement shall remain unaffected by the terms
hereof.
 
      3.    This
Amendment may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original and all of which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.  A facsimile signature shall be deemed to be an original
signature for purposes of this Amendment.
 
      4.    This
Amendment is intended to be in full compliance with the requirements for an
Amendment to the Merger Agreement as required by Section 11.4 of the Merger
Agreement, and every defect in fulfilling such requirements for an effective
amendment to the Merger Agreement is hereby ratified, intentionally waived and
relinquished by all parties hereto.

全年業績:
集團的收入與去年相若，截至2016年12月31日止年度收入約160.0百萬港元，較截至2015年12月31日止年度約160.4百萬港元下跌約0.3百萬港元或0.2%。 
溢利及純利率在截至2015年及2016年12月31日止年度分別維持在約15.0百萬港元及9.4%。 
業務回顧：
與行內其他同業不同，集團是香港十大財經印刷服務供應商之一。集團提供範圍廣泛的服務，從為於聯交所上市之公司及潛在上市申請者、基金公司和保險公司提供財經印刷服務到市場營銷周邊產品及嶄新度身訂造之非印刷服務，如網站設計、提昇及改良、視頻製作、電子書、APP開發及維護、電子營銷匯報材料製作等。 
集團屹立市場多年，已成功建立廣泛客戶基礎，包括藍籌股、國有企業、全球基金公司及主要保險公司。集團相信，集團維繫定期客戶的能力，體現於彼等認可集團具質素服務，而集團認為，彼等之認可乃集團於行內取得成功之一大關鍵因素。截至2016年及2015年12月31日止兩個年度分別有約66.6%及70.6%的客戶為定期客戶，在各期間為集團帶來總收入約90.9%及88.2%。 
集團產生自財經印刷項目的收益由截至2015年12月31日止年度約117.1百萬港元輕微減少約0.3%至截至2016年12月31日止年度約116.7百萬港元。此減少主要由於包括(i)首次公開招股章程；及(ii)基金投資內容出品的財經印刷項目數量減少所致。 
集團產生自市場營銷周邊產品印刷項目的收益由截至2015年12月31日止年度約42.8百萬港元輕微減少約1.3%至截至2016年12月31日止年度約42.2百萬港元。此項減少主要由於市場營銷周邊產品印刷項目數量由2015年811個減少至2016年678個。 
集團其他項目的收益由截至2015年12月31日止年度約0.5百萬港元增長約137.7%至截至2016年12月31日止年度約1.1百萬港元。此歸因於增加了27個項目帶動了此增長。 
業務展望:
集團於聯交所上市大大提升集團企業形象，並鞏固其財務狀況。為把握香港業務流程外包服務需求殷切帶來的蓬勃商機，集團打算藉以但不限於翻新其無限極廣場辦公室、搬遷另一辦公室至中環以及增添新設施，以改善其整體基礎設施及設備，提供更好的客戶體驗。為加強服務質素，集團亦計劃提升資訊科技系統及基礎設施，包括採取╱推行安全流動辦公室系統。集團將繼續招聘有經驗的員工，與此同時將繼續培訓、培養及激勵團隊，以提供卓越服務。   資料來源於上市公司財務報表最後更新日: 2017/05/24             相關個股新聞        《公司業績》HM INTL HLDGS(08416.HK)首季盈轉虧蝕337萬     HM(08416.HK)股權高度集中     《盈警響號》營業額跌 HM INTL(08416.HK)料首季錄淨虧損     《公司業績》HM INTL(08416.HK)全年純利1497萬  增7.9%     《新股表現》HM(08416.HK)全日收3.7元  高配售價5.2倍               網站地圖 返回頁首▲         阿思達克財經網 - 主頁   產品資訊  巿場動態  - 香港指數 - 國際指數 - 中國主要指數 - 即時期貨 - 活躍股票 - 行業分類表現 - 香港指數成份股 - 所有國企股 - 所有紅籌股 - 所有創業板股份 - ETF    - ETF 概覽   - ETF 詳細資料   - 槓桿/反向 ETF   - 熱門 ETF   - ETF 搜尋   - ETF 比較   - ETF 教學   - ETF 評論  - 公司通告 - 沽空研究 - 大行報告 - 公司派息 - 公佈業績新聞 - 業績公佈時間表 - 公司活動搜尋 - 新股頻道 IPO - 權益披露一覽表 - A+H - 預託證券 ADR - A+H+ADR - 經濟日誌 - 經濟數據庫 - 經濟數據圖表 - 環球利率總覽    報價  - 快速即時報價    - 即時報價   - 即時最近查詢報價   - 即時即市走勢圖   - 即時活躍股票   - 即時綜合投資組合   - 即時技術投資分析  - 即時詳細報價 - 即時基本圖表 - 即時圖表分析 - 即時互動圖表 - 即時期貨 - 相關認股證報價 - 相關牛熊證報價 - 股票代號搜尋  分析  - 即時圖表分析 - 即時互動圖表 - 即時股價走勢 - 沽空 - 成交記錄 - 大戶成交 - 資金流向 - 同業 - 權益披露 - 公司新聞及公告 - AASTOCKS市場異動    - 所有   - 大幅波動   - 大幅上升   - 大幅下跌   - 大手成交   - 停牌復牌  - 公司資料    - 公司概括   - 公司資料   - 基本數據   - 財務比率   - 損益表   - 現金流量表   - 資產負債表   - 盈利摘要   - 派息紀錄   - 股份回購  - 即時技術投資分析 - 即時綜合投資組合   新聞中心  - AASTOCKS財經新聞    - 重點新聞   - 熱門新聞   - 即市新聞   - 大行報告   - 公司新聞   - 公司公告   - 公佈業績   - 經濟數據   - 新股消息   - 中港樓市   - 外圍市場   - 國家政策   - 窩輪牛熊   - 財星股評   - 缸邊情報   - 技術攻略   - 行業分類   - 外匯新聞   - 基金新聞   - 中國行業新聞   - 中國宏觀經濟   - 中國今日要聞  - AASTOCKS市場異動    - 所有   - 大幅波動   - 大幅上升   - 大幅下跌   - 大手成交   - 停牌復牌  - 港交所信息披露 - 中國市場新聞    - 所有   - 中國行業新聞   - 中國宏觀經濟   - 中國今日要聞   - 公司新聞   - 公司公告    評論及研究  - 評論概覽 - 股票評論 - 滬/深港通評論 - 基金評論 - 外匯評論 - 研究報告   認股證  - 認股證(窩輪)主頁 - 認股證(窩輪)比較 - 即將到期認股證(窩輪) - 認股證(窩輪)搜尋  牛熊證  - 牛熊證主頁 - 牛熊證比較 - 即將收回牛熊證 - 即將到期牛熊證 - 強制收回牛熊證 - 牛熊證搜尋    MPF  - 強積金概覽 - 強積金簡易搜尋 - 強積金比較 - 強積金教學  美股  - 美股主頁 - 美股報價    - 美股報價   - 美股圖表   - 活躍美股   - 美國預託證券ADR   - 美股代號搜尋  - 新聞 - 巿場動態    - 經濟日誌   - 經濟數據庫   - 經濟數據圖表    外匯  - 外匯主頁 - 外匯報價    - 外匯報價   - 外匯圖表   - 環球外匯走勢   - 活躍匯率   - 外幣交叉盤   - 外匯代號搜尋  - 外匯新聞 - 外匯評論 - 巿場動態    - 經濟日誌   - 經濟數據庫   - 經濟數據圖表   - 環球利率總覽  - 外幣兌換一覽表    基金  - 基金主頁 - 基金報價    - 基金報價   - 基金圖表   - 資料及費用   - 基金簡介   - 與近似基金比較  - 基金新聞 - 基金評論 - 工具    - 預設主題基金搜尋   - 基金搜尋   - 基金比較     客戶服務  - 會員登記 - 更改資料 - 更改密碼 - 忘記密碼 - 意見收集 - 聯絡我們 - 常見問題 - 教育中心  關於我們  - 公司簡介 - 人才招聘 - 免責聲明 - 私隱條例  AASTOCKS  - 中國站    AABEST AASTOCKS旗下一站式 理財產品比較平台   - 信用卡比較    - 信用卡比較   - 飛行里數   - 現金回贈   - 餐飲回贈   - 網上購物   - 海外消費   - 迎新禮品    - 貸款比較    - 私人分期貸款   - 結餘轉戶   - 循環貸款   - 信用卡貸款   - 按揭    - 定期存款比較    - 新資金優惠(港幣)   - 新資金優惠(外幣)   - 基本定期存款    - 旅遊保險比較                投資項目資訊： 【香港股票】 | 【香港期貨/期權】 | 【認股證】 | 【牛熊證】 | 【外匯】 | 【黃金】 | 【香港指數】 | 【環球指數】 | 【深圳AB股】 | 【上海AB股】 | 【美國股票】       會員服務： 【免費延時報價】 | 【即時串流報價】 | 【即時圖表分析】 | 【即時點擊報價】 | 【上市公司資料庫】 | 【即市新聞】       資訊範圍： 【個股報價】 | 【圖表分析】 | 【公司資料】 | 【新股消息】 | 【財經日誌】 | 【人工智能】 | 【大手成交】 | 【升跌股價】 | 【研究報告】 | 【金融新聞】 | 【走勢分析】       即時行情：  【即時報價】 |  【即時最近查詢報價】 |  【即時即市走勢圖】 |  【即時排行】 |  【即時綜合投資組合】 |  【即時技術投資分析】                     關於我們 | 加入會員 | 廣告查詢 | 支援 | 免責聲明 | 私隱條例  |  聯絡我們 | 人才招聘  支援電郵： support@aastocks.com    阿斯達克網絡信息有限公司 (AASTOCKS.COM LIMITED) 版權所有，不得轉載      免責聲明
