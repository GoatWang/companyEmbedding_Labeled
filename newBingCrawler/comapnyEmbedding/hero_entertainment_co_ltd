Why Choose Led Panels Lighting?
LED Lighting Products are taking over from the traditional Fluorescent Tube, or the so called Low Watt Lamps, and the reason is simple economics. Not only do you have the reduction in energy usage, up to 90% less, but you also have the cost of replacing tubes, starters, as well as the cost of company that physically does the work. Most commercial ceilings are based on a 600mm grid system for simple tile replacement, our best selling LED Panel fits exactly into your existing 600mm tile grid system. Our LED Panels come in a larger size of 1200mm x 600mm (double panel) and yes they can replace your existing 600 or 1200mm Fluorescent Tube fittings.
 
EU Certified, all our products have passed the relevant and rigorous EU safety standards and are all insurance approved.If you have any technical or installation questions please feel free to Contact Us.
