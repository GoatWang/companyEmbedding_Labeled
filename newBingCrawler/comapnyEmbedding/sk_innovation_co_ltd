P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Business summary
SK Innovation Co., Ltd. engages in the development and production of batteries and information electronic (I/E) materials. It operates through the following business areas: Exploration and Production, Battery, and I/E Materials. The Exploration and Production business develops and secures energy resources such as liquefied natural gas, crude oil, and coal. The Battery business provides cell, module, pack, and battery management system. The I/E Material business offers lithium ion battery separator, tri-acetate cellulose film, and flexible copper clad laminate. The company was founded on July 3, 2007 and is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.
Company background
SK Innovation is a leading oil and chemical company in South Korea, and a core business of the SK group, the country's third-largest conglomerate. It deals with a wide range of businesses, from petroleum development to batteries and information electronics materials. It has also extended its efforts to the development of nonconventional energy resources, such as shale-derived resources.

     The company's origins date back to the establishment of Korea Oil, the country's first oil refining company, in 1962. In addition to the business of its own, SK Innovation has widened its business through its subsidiaries. These include: SK Energy for oil refinery and wholesale; SK Lubricants for production of lubricating oil for leading automakers worldwide, including BMW of Germany; and SK Global Chemical for chemical products.

     The company is engaged in a large-scale project in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where it has acquired a stake in an oil producing field. As the first attempt ever among South Korean businesses, the company is preparing to produce oil and gas from the field's shale layers. The company expects the production of shale-derived energy to eventually reach about 15% of total capacity in the field.

     The company is also actively involved in new businesses. It has signed with Chinese businesses, including a leading automaker, to form a joint venture in China to produce battery packs for electric vehicles, with a capacity target of 20,000 units by 2017.

     In addition, SK Global Chemical has agreed with Saudi Basic Industries to launch a joint effort to produce and market Nexlene, a high-performance polyethylene originally developed using SK's own technology.
