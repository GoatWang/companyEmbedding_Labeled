Mission
Business Intelligence to Change Your World

Combining technological innovation with human ingenuity to organize and analyze business information from around the globe. We will reshape your world with a service that improves your productivity and unleashes your creativity.
Seven rules

Think beyond the norm and take your own initiatives.
We avoid being bound by limitations - think beyond the norm and realize the endless possibilities. Without boundaries, our greatest achievements will come to life. However, we must all be responsible for ourselves, and hold each other to this standard. Not to create a boundary, but to inspire a culture of initiative taking.
Ingenuity in the industry is essential.
Is this revolutionary? Would this inspire excitement in our users? These are the questions we ask of ourselves. If the answer is no, then there is little purpose. We use our strengths as a team, fusing our renowned technological skills with our business process to continue providing products and services that breathe creativity.
Approach every situation with the user in mind.
Thinking of what is ‘doable’ is not a starting point. We use our ingenuity to capture users’ imaginations. We listen with open ears, hearts, and minds to pursue minimalism in our products, avoiding being caught up in minor or trivial details.
Surprise the user with the speed of the results.
Develop faster than anywhere; improve faster than anybody. Our culture is speed. The evolution of our products, the speed of our decision-making, the efficiency of our work, our response to users - we always aim to be the fastest in all aspects, and we abandon the ineffective from within.
The road less traveled brings the most growth.
We are on a journey with no correct answers. When in doubt, choose the path of greater challenges. Although choosing this path inevitably brings mistakes, by doing so together, we can create better solutions. In our world, failure is the shortcut to success. Failure bears strength and continuous innovation.
Your team will be there in your darkest hour.
We cannot be super heroes alone. It is only when we connect with each other as a team that our individual potential and abilities become limitless. The true challenge comes in the darkest hour, when everyone is on the verge of giving up. It is in these times we offer a hand to each other to turn around and achieve the best result.
Celebrate individual differences and unleash your own talents.
There is infinite potential when unique minds work together. By recognizing and embracing our differences in values, ethnicity, religion, gender, and sexual orientation, we are empowered to shape our own future. Communication from the heart is the essence of an environment where everybody has a free and equal voice.
