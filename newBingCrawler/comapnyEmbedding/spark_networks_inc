We're announcing the folks who are helping us making this year's AVC the best AVC!

This year’s SparkFun Autonomous Vehicle Competition (AVC) promises to be our biggest yet with the inclusion of three types of autonomous vehicle races, as well as 12-pound and 30-pound combat bots. In addition to the event’s move to Maker Faire® Denver, our friends at Digi-Key Electronics, Wurth Electronics and Aleph Objects (LulzBot) have joined the fun as sponsors and will be providing some extra goodies for competitors on site.
 
Digi-Key Electronics: Exclusive Pro-Maker Sponsor
Digi-Key is sponsoring two special awards for competitors this year in addition to hanging out in the pits with some cool product demos. They will be sponsoring the Engineers’ Choice and Crowd Pleaser awards (check out the descriptions here). The special awards are applicable to adult teams only.
Wurth Electronics: Supporting Co-Sponsor
Make sure to stop by the Wurth Electronics station in the pits to make repairs to your bots or vehicles. They’ll have resources for competitors, including some repair/replacement connector products for teams, technical advice on electronic workings of circuits from development engineers and field applications engineers, and a full display of our passive components product line.
Aleph Objects (LulzBot): Student Competitions Sponsor
As part of our increased efforts to support student teams competing in AVC, Aleph Objects is providing 16 LulzBot Mini 3D printers as first place prizes for our student competitions, as well as exhibiting at Maker Faire Denver as another local maker company. This is the first year we are hosting a 1-pound Plastic Ants combat bot competition, where the majority of the bot’s parts need to be plastic, and we’re excited to incorporate some 3D printing lessons into building some of those lil guys.
 
This year promises to be bigger and better than ever as we join our sponsors and Maker Faire Denver in celebrating creativity and making, right here in Colorado!
To get the full rundown of this year’s prizes, check out avc.sparkfun.com.

Industrial Design
Industrial Design is one of our most important strengths here at Spark Innovations! Industrial design is the service of generating and developing concepts that enhance the function, use, appearance for the benefit of both the user and the manufacturer.

 
 
 




Mechanical Engineering
Spark’s team of Mechanical Engineers ensures that our concepts are feasible from the start. One of Spark’s strongest abilities is in designing products for high-volume production. This entails a very different way of thinking about design.

 
 
 




Patent Services
Today’s successful products are all about patents. Patents allow a startup to startup. With a small investment in Intellectual property a startup business can have protection and slowly build it’s business with profits and minor investment.

Sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement and Lets Get Started!
Download the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that works best for you. You have these two options:

The Second Party Confidential Non-Disclosure Agreement is used when you are sharing the invention with us and we agree to keep it undisclosed.
If you want us both to share confidential information with each other this The Reciprocal Confidential Non-Disclosure Agreement is ideal.

 
 



 

How to fill the NDA

Put your name on name the 1st line.
Then a brief description of the idea/product on the 2nd line.
Add time period. A typical term is 3 to 5 years.
Sign & date the 2nd page.
