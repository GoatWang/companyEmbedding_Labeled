Marketing mix" is a general phrase used to describe the different kinds of choices organizations have to make in the whole process of bringing a product or service to market. The 4 Ps is one way - probably the best-known way - of defining the marketing mix, and was first expressed in 1960 by E J McCarthy.
What is marketing?
Putting the right product in the right place, at the right price, at the right time.
When We talk about Market,Whether you are a small business or a large corporation you need a good marketing strategy. There are many ways to market your business the question is which ways are the most effective for your product or service?
Ray-Ban is a Eyewear company.This Company just make Sunglasses.
The 4 P's of Ray-Ban
Marketing decisions generally fall into the following four controllable categories:
Product
Price
Place (distribution)
Promotion
PRODUCT
Product/Service
The term "product" refers to tangible, physical products as well as services. Here are some examples of the product decisions to be made:
Brand name
Functionality
Styling
Quality
Safety
Packaging
Repairs and Support
Warranty
Accessories and services
Ray-Ban have a eyewear products.Ray-Ban become a good brand in eyewear industry. Ray-Ban know what does the customer want from the product and what needs does it satisfy. Ray-Ban just selling googols but in many models. Ray-Ban giving guaranty on some googols glasses for screech. Ray-Ban produces a product which is stylish and different from others eyewear companies like fastrack.Ray-Ban also selling its classics Googols because Ray-Ban know that customer like classical model to wear at present time where the fashion change day by day but Ray-Ban producing their old models and selling. Ray-Ban selling their product at high price because company giving some features like U V protection. And Ray-Ban Sunglasses never give bad effect on eye side. So these type of product's features helps to meet customers wants and needs.what these type of features may be customer don't want or actually use for example if we talk about Ray-ban glasses the most of Customer when they wearing googols they are driving car or some time in party.
How and where will the customer use it?
When Ray-Ban company started in 1937 the most of consumer wearing this just for protect their eyes from sunrays.But now its become part of fashion.If somebody wearing a branded cloths and if he also wearing a branded sunglasses not anyone its give a good impression.Ray-Ban sunglasses comes in only three colors like Black, Silver and Golden
Ray-Ban have many Models in this three colors.Ray-Ban sunglasses wearing by most famous personalities in whole wold.its become a symbol of living statues.And Ray-Ban company never try to sell their product at low price because of competition .These all things create a branded product to Ray-Ban in market.
Place
When we talk about place the first thing is where do buyers look for your product or service?
Ray-Ban sunglasses is a world wide product.Ray-Ban selling sunglasses in Ray-Ban show rooms and optical shops.Ray-Ban opened their showrooms in big cities and also selling in small cities.Ray-Ban sell their product in super moles and shopping complex .Ray-Ban set a special shop in moles and also use net to sell.so if somebody wants to purchase Ray-Ban sunglasses so he have all type of option for purchasing.Ray-Ban's product only for those consumer who have high purchasing power.So it is a product who shows your status in societies who want to use it for feel proud he purchase it by giving a high price.there is no neet of any type of sales force.
Price
Price Decisions
Some examples of pricing decisions to be made include:
Pricing strategy (skim, penetration, etc.)
Suggested retail price
Volume discounts and wholesale pricing
Cash and early payment discounts
Seasonal pricing
Bundling
Price flexibility
Price discrimination
Ray-Ban using skimming strategy for pricing.Because Ray-Ban company Build their image as a good brand so company use it and skimming the market share.There is no price flexibility company use same price strategy.In winter company give some discount.
What is the value of the product or service to the buyer?
Promotion
In the context of the marketing mix, promotion represents the various aspects of marketing communication, that is, the communication of information about the product with the goal of generating a positive customer response. Marketing communication decisions include:
The Ray-Ban brand then becomes meaningless as whole and its meaning is diffused and fragmented over the millions of viewers who are individually "making up" the Ray-Ban brand meaning. Hotmail's approach kept the power of the brand and therefore its meaning, equity, and potential for building preference in its message and provided a way, through a hotlink, in which consumers could immediately subscribe and get more information on Hotmail and its brand. With Ray-Ban, if one reads the comments posted on sites like YouTube concerning their viral videos, very few even know what they are really watching. Most think only they are good videos with the discussion centering around how the videos were made not about Ray-Ban, its "Never Hide" campaign, or even sunglasses. So what is Ray-Ban trying to do?
BRAND Must Retain Control
What marketers must remember is that for any brand to be successful, the BRAND must control the flow, content, and meaning of the message it conveys if it wants to increase market share and all-important preference. The power of any good brand lies in its ability to connect with the target audience on a highly-charged emotional level. This connection and meaning, however, can only be molded and derived from the brand itself, NOT from individual consumers. Rather than a single cohesive and comprehensive brand meaning, the brand would have as many meanings as there are current and potential customers, a marketing model that is inefficient and prohibitively expensive. Ray-Ban is not alone in jumping on the viral marketing bandwagon. While the promise still exists to exploit this kind of marketing in a way that is truly brand-centric and can unleash the true power of brand, marketers have yet to uncover the formula. For most brands, viral marketing is a virus brands can still do without.
Key points:
The marketing mix of Ray-Ban define the marketing elements for successfully positioning Ray-Ban product market offer.
One of the best known models is the Four Ps, which helps define Ray-Ban price strategy, marketing options in terms of product, place, and promotion.

In 1932, at the height of the Depression, a pharmacist named Henry Schein started our company with the belief that we can fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen by giving back to the communities we serve. Ever since then, we have pursued the ideal of "doing well by doing good." This spirit of individuals helping society is exemplified through Henry Schein Cares, our global corporate social responsibility program.

X-ray(AXI)  Products
In-line automated 3D X-ray inspection system “BF-X2” for Semiconductors and IGBT power module inspection and “BF-X3” for PCB inspection, with Saki’s original planar CT (pCT) technology, can perform CT operation against plane object and obtain high definition slice images in high speed. Those also provide long-term stability and high rigidity gantry structure and high safety based on European standards.



BF-X2In-line 3D AXI for Semiconductor, Power module inspection

Enable broaden range of inspection from Semiconductor to IGBT power module
Adopted 160 kV and 225kV micro focus X-ray open tubes

 

BF-X2 can inspect and detect various objects, such as flip chip soldering, void in TSV and LTH in semiconductor field, and also IGBT power module soldering in power device field.
Saki Corporation has successfully developed planar CT technology which can accurately  reconstruct 3D shape based on transmission images scanned from various angles by using micro focus X-ray open tube and high definition flat panel in combination. Scanning is performed at accurate position by high rigidity gantry to create pCT reconstructed images of very high definition. When nano-focus high definition 160kV type X-ray source and high definition flat panel are used in combination, fine structure inside semiconductor can be analyzed. Also, when high power 225kV type X-ray source and long life X-ray camera are used in combination, layer structure of power electronics and on-vehicle devices can be analyzed in real time.

BF-X3In-line 3D AXI for PCB inspection

In-line machine optimized for PCB assembly line, which combines micro focus closed type X-ray source and high definition flat panel detector.
BGA ball’s head in pillow defects, which are said to be one of the most difficult inspection items can be detected automatically without fail.

 

BF-X3 can perfectly separate top and bottom side of printed circuit board. BF-X3 can also measure solder joint structure of assembled QFNs and BGAs as well as lamination state of PoPs with high definition in 3D.
BF-X3 automatically corrects PCB warpage and position misalignment, and creates 3D data for entire sample by connecting partially reconstructed 3D data. By doing so, it supports inspection data generation for microchips, large ICs and connectors without requiring a user to intentionally execute a special operation for FOV size. Various necessary functions such as stabilization method of X-ray intensity and automatic calibration method are properly equipped with the machines to assure automatic inspection capability.
