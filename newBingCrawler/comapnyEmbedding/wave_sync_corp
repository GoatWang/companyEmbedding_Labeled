(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition since the Company's inception should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Prospectus. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words "may," "will," "should," "would," "anticipate," "estimate," "possible," "expect," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "could," "believe," "predict," "potential," "intend," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, availability of additional equity or debt financing, changes in sales or industry trends, competition, retention of senior management and other key personnel, availability of materials or components, ability to make continued product innovations, casualty or work stoppages at our facilities, adverse results of lawsuits against us and currency exchange rates. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and speak only as of the date hereof. Management undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this report.  Overview of Business  The Company is a development stage in the business of design, development, and proliferation of next generation debit and credit cards for financial institutions employing innovative secured encryption technology transmitted via audio wave technology; the Company has partnered with China Construction Bank under a pilot program to develop and market to the end using bank customers and business operators to adopt the next generations of cards by developing point of sale and commercial interfaces via software and other solutions to generate demand for these cards as a value-added alternative to current generation debit and credit cards, and China UnionPay has authorized our Company to use its logo on these debit and credit cards.  Critical Accounting Policies  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.  The independent accounting firm restated the accrual of franchise tax payable for the year ended December 31, 2015 and reflected the adjustments in the financial statements for the year of 2015. For more information of the restated financial statements of 2015, please refer to "Note 14 Restatement and Correction of Error" of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on the form 10-k.  Results of Operations  We are a development stage company and have generated minimal revenues from operations since our inception on November 11, 2013 to December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $1,968,225 and total liabilities of $2,782,165. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  We are in the process of developing our products and services. Consequently, we generated minimal revenues as of the date of this report. We have an accumulated deficit and have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect losses to continue during 2016.  Revenue  Revenue was derived from a service contract for technical consulting. We earned revenues of $30,691 for the year ended December, 2016.  Expenses  During the 12 months period ended December 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $1,248,324. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $1,334,076. General and administrative and professional fee expenses were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting, developmental costs, and marketing expenses.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  We expect to continue to expend cash in 2017 as we continue to expand research, development and manufacturing efforts for the audio cards and related technologies. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $16,590,509 and working capital deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by $860,098 due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods. Management's plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification(TM) ("ASC") is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to our company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on our company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

Thanks guys. You are simply the best. Moneygram and Western Union are out of business! This is the real deal for the common man.
Francis Achieng





I'm glad it's such a simple process. My family confirmed receipt. I think this is the best service for Kenyans in the US and I will spread the good news all over the States :)
Margaret Kamba

	the mainstream dynamic encryption system, which generates different passwords for different transactions.




	 




	Safety
	of Communication




	 




	For
	each transaction, the Audio Bank Card generates a different audio sound, which cannot be utilized more than once. Equipped with
	the advanced coding technology, the audio communication is safe and resistant to unexpected interference.




	 




	Safety
	of Transactions




	 




	Includes
	a triple verification system to secure your transactions: the identity of the card holder will be verified in three ways, confirming
	the transaction channel, verifying the government identification and answering a set of dynamic security questions.




	 




	An
	Interesting Way to Make Payments




	 




	When
	conducting a transaction, the Audio Bank Card holder may easily control the payment process by pressing the button on his or her
	card. The end users do not have to attach their Audio Bank Cards to certain devices or register with a third party software provider.
	The card holders will be able to use their Audio Bank Cards directly on traditional phones, smart phones, computers and tablets.
	The Audio Bank Card can function as a regular bank card as well. Its audio recognition system greatly advances the safety of making
	payments and reduces the risks associated therewith. An end user may simply follow three steps to complete a transaction: 1) choose
	an Audio Bank Card to make the contemplated payment, 2) press the button on the card to help the back desk recognize the card,
	and 3) enter the passcode to complete the transaction. The Audio Bank Card will simplify the payment process and therefore save
	users' time.

			Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)		



SyncE is a physical layer based synchronization implementation for packet networks requiring frequency synchronization. Microsemi provides SyncE only with an easy migration path to IEEE 1588 or combined SyncE and IEEE 1588 for both frequency and time alignment. The market leader in Synchronous Ethernet timing devices, Microsemi was the first to introduce Synchronous Ethernet PLLs in 2006. Microsemi now offers the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of SyncE timing devices, providing G.8262 compliance and ultra-low jitter for 10G PHYs.
