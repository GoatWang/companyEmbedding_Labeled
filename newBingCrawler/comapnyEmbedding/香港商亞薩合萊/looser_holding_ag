Press Release


Currency effects and reduced demand had a negative impact on revenues and results of operations

Net revenues CHF 330.7 million (prior year: CHF 370.8 million)EBITDA CHF 36.8 million (prior year: CHF 48.0 million)EBITDA margin 11.1 percent (prior year: 13.0 percent)Looser Holding AG’s accounting standards will be changed from IFRS to Swiss GAAP FER

In the first nine months of 2015, Looser Holding AG, headquartered in Arbon (Switzerland), generated consolidated net revenues of CHF 330.7 million (prior year: CHF 370.8 million). Thus net revenues declined by 10.8 percent from the previous year. The decline after adjustments for currency effects amounted to 2.8 percent. The operating result (EBITDA) was reduced to CHF 36.8 million compared to CHF 48.0 million in the prior year. The EBITDA margin amounted to 11.1 percent (prior year: 13.0 percent). The appreciation of the Swiss franc and generally weakened demand, in particular in the Coatings segment, had a significant impact on revenues and results of operations in the first nine months of 2015.Consolidated net income declined to CHF 9.1 million (prior year: CHF 17.0 million) due to the reduced result of operations. The balance sheet continued to be sound with a 41.1 percent equity ratio.Net debt decreased by CHF 10.9 million from the comparable prior year date and remained unchanged from the level reported in the 2014 financial statements.Detailed segment informationNet revenues in the Coatings segment declined by 16.7 percent from the prior year level and by 14.9 percent after currency adjustments. On the one hand, demand weakened further in all product areas (wood, non-stick and packaging coatings). On the other hand, in addition to the effects of the strong Swiss franc, the current economic environment in China had a negative impact on the development of revenues. A 4.5 percent decline in revenues compared to the prior year period was reported in the Industrial Services segment. Revenues after currency adjustments fell by 3.3 percent. While trading activities in the areas of cranes, modular space systems and construction machinery experienced a slight decline, the rental business and in particular the Event Services product area recorded a stable development so that the share of rental income in total revenues increased marginally over the prior year. Net revenues in the Temperature Control segment declined by 14.2 percent from the prior year and by 2.8 percent after currency adjustments. Declining revenues from applications for the semi-conductor industry could not be offset by positive developments in the core business. The Doors segment again saw a positive development. Net revenues after currency adjustments increased by 6.2 percent from the prior year period.Change from IFRS to Swiss GAAP FERThe Board of Directors decided to change the accounting standards from IFRS to Swiss GAAP FER. This resolution will be implemented retroactively from the 2014 financial year when drawing up the 2015 financial statements. The registered shares of Looser Holding AG will continue to be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and to be a component of the Swiss Performance Index (SPI).The change from IFRS to Swiss GAAP FER will mainly involve adjustments with respect to the accounting for business combinations (treatment of goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions) as well as pension obligations (IAS 19). Under Swiss GAAP FER, goodwill within the Looser Group will in the future be capitalized and amortized over the useful life. As far as pension obligations are concerned, the Looser Group’s liabilities under existing retirement benefit plans will be much lower pursuant to Swiss GAAP FER. From today’s point of view, Looser Holding AG anticipates that, due to the change to Swiss GAAP FER, its equity base will continue to be sound at approximately 33 percent and its EBIT margin will be reduced by up to 1.5 percentage points.Outlook for 2015For the full financial year Looser Holding AG expects a decline in revenues by 10 to 12 percent and a reduced EBITDA margin compared to the prior year.Key figures Looser Group(Amounts in thousands of CHF)Jan 1 to Sep 30, 2015Jan 1 to Sep 30, 2014Net revenues330,702370,755Change in net revenues (in %)-10.81.7Change in net revenues after adjustments for currency effects (in %)-2.8Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)36,78648,034EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues11.113.0Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)19,11230,786EBIT as a percentage of net revenues5.88.3Consolidated net income9,12416,977Consolidated earnings per registered share (in CHF)2.404.47Cash-flow from operations15,45625,472As of 30.09.2015As of 31.12.2014Shareholders’ equity206,023217,904Net debt119,607119,674Number of employees at the end of the period2,2662,255Key revenue figures of the segments(Amounts in thousands of CHF)Jan 1 to Sep 30, 2015Jan 1 to Sep 30, 2014in CHF + / in %in local currency + / - in %Net revenues Coatings106,470127,877-16.7-14.9Net revenues Industrial Services43,00745,015-4.5-3.3Net revenues Temperature Control24,71528,793-14.2-2.8Net revenues Doors159,647172,631-7.5+6.2

Looser Holding Plans to Sell its Coatings Segment



Published on 2016-08-10. Author :
SpecialChem









Looser Holding AG has announced its plans to sell the Coatings segment. The intended sale marks the outcome of the strategy review that was announced in the second half of 2015.


Intended Sale Marks the Outcome of its Strategy Review







Looser Holding



Following an overall assessment of the strategic options, the company management has taken the decision to concentrate its forces and to focus on the two divisions of Industrial Services and Doors. A selling process has been launched for the Coatings Group, comprising the companies of:

Feyco AG
Treffert Coatings GmbH (FEYCO TREFFERT) 
Industrielack AG (ILAG) 
Schekolin AG 


The aim is to transfer these companies to a new proprietor by the end of 2016, if possible. The main concern is to achieve a good and sustainable solution for the Coatings Group's business and, in particular, for its employees. 

The Coatings Group is active in the sectors of wood coatings, non-stick coatings and packaging coatings in regional and international niche markets. In the light of the coating companies' high innovativeness, comprehensive product portfolio and leading market positions, the Board of Directors and Group Executive Management are convinced that a wide range of positive development options are open to the companies of the Coatings segment under a new proprietor.

After the planned transaction, the Looser Group will comprise the two segments of Doors and Industrial Services. Both segments are strategically well-placed and are in an excellent competitive position, with a high earnings power. The proceeds from the sale are to be used for the further dynamic development of these two segments.

Looser Holding AG, headquartered in Arbon (Switzerland) today announced plans to invest to a greater extent in the product areas of wood coatings and packaging coatings. The investment strengthens the Swiss wood coatings business of Feyco AG and supports the international expansion of the packaging coatings business Schekolin AG. For the implementation of existing synergy potential, the expansion and modernization of the production site of Schekolin AG in Bendern (Principality of Liechtenstein) as well as a competence and training center in Urdorf are provided.

13 million investment in Bendern

16.10.2014



Ground-breaking ceremony at the Site of Schekolin AG for logistics hall and office building in Bendern



Looser Holding AG is investing some CHF 13 million in the modernisation of buildings and capacity expansion at the Schekolin AG site in Bendern. A logistics hall and an office building are being constructed on an area of 4,614 square metres. The new buildings are scheduled to come into operation in September 2015. 
 
With the start of the extensive building work in Bendern, Looser Holding AG with its head office in Arbon (Switzerland) is launching the next step in the further development of its coatings segment. In August 2014, the industrial holding company announced that it was realigning the manufacturing operations for wood coatings at Feyco AG/Treffert GmbH and for packaging coatings at Schekolin AG. In the period up until December 2015, the production operations of Feyco AG in St. Margrethen and Urdorf are being transferred to Schekolin AG in Bendern.
 
"It was process optimisation and the exploitation of synergies between these two companies in the Rhine Valley that prompted this major investment", explained Tim Talaat, CEO of the Looser Group. "With the expansion of the infrastructure in Bendern, we are intending to boost the efficiency and productivity of the wood coating and packaging coating product areas and optimise operating and logistics costs. In the wood coatings field, the main focus is on long-term success, securing competitiveness and expanding the market share in Switzerland. For packaging coatings, it is growth at an international level that constitutes the focus", Tim Talaat went on to explain.
 
Modernisation and a new building with vision
The first phase of the construction project was completed in August already with the renovation of the floor in the existing Schekolin production shops. The start of the second construction phase involves building a new logistics hall with a useable area of 2,114 square metres. The hall will accommodate the finished goods store, outgoing goods, the laundry, the plant workshop and the plant fire brigade. In addition, a three-storey office block extension is being built to provide some 290 square metres of office and laboratory space. The new buildings are steel structures with a sandwich panel façade.
 
This design satisfies the latest requirements in terms of ecology, the Major Accident Ordinance, occupational safety and ergonomics. For the building project, Schekolin AG is being connected up to the local district heating network operated by the waste incineration plant and is thus implementing a CO2-neutral heating solution. The sewers and the fire-water and retention systems ensure that the plant can be completely hermetically sealed-off in the event of an accident. In the storage and intermediate areas, state-of-the art loading and removal devices are to be deployed, contributing inter alia to the optimisation of material flow processes.
 
Dagmar Gadow, Deputy Head of the Local Council of Bendern, said: "In economically challenging times, it is gratifying when an internationally operating industrial holding company like the Looser Group has faith in Liechtenstein as a business location and invests in long-term growth. The Local Council is setting out to support Schekolin and Feyco/Treffert in attaining their growth aims."
 
Commitment to the Rhine Valley
In the light of the companies' position as eminent employers and reliable producers of high-grade coating systems, which has been built up over a period of many years, the further expansion of the product areas of wood coatings at Feyco AG/Treffert GmbH and packaging coatings at Schekolin AG testifies to a clear commitment to the Rhine Valley economic region. And this forms the basis for the companies' development and growth plans.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
