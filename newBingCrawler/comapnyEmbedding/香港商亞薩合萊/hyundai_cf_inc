A relative newcomer to the American marketplace, Hyundai is a Korean automaker with a product line that has improved greatly over the past decade. Hyundai cars and SUVs provide a high level of content for an affordable price, and are currently backed by one of the industry's longest warranties.
In 1947, Chung Ju Yung founded the Hyundai Civil Engineering Company. Mere months later, the outfit was bombed in the Korean War. However, the company regained its footing to distinguish itself as one of Korea's leading construction enterprises during the 1950s.
By the late 1960s, Chung had turned his attention to the automobile industry. The Korean government at that time believed that it made more sense to import vehicles than produce them domestically, and had made its opinion known. Still, Chung opted to follow his own convictions, and in 1967, he founded the Hyundai Motor Company.
The company quickly established an alliance with one of the industry's oldest automakers, signing a two-year contract with Ford in 1968 to share assembly technology. Hyundai's first car, the Cortina, was created from that partnership. The manufacturer's first car to be designed and built in Korea was the compact Pony (although the car was based on Japanese technology courtesy of Mitsubishi). The vehicle made its debut in 1974, and the following year Hyundai began exporting it to overseas markets.
Hyundai entered the U.S. market in 1986 with the introduction of its subcompact Excel. The car was an immediate hit, with its supreme affordability being a primary selling point. More than 100,000 Excels were sold stateside in the first seven months. By 1988, Hyundai had begun to produce cars using its own technology. The midsize Sonata was the first fruit borne of this endeavor.
Unfortunately, Hyundai's nascent image was soon tarnished by the poor durability and reliability of its vehicles. Sales tanked. However, rather than abandon the American market in the '90s, Hyundai chose to invest heavily in new product designs and improvements in overall quality and reliability. In 1998, Hyundai also purchased Kia, another Korean automaker, to expand its business and economies of scale.
It all started to pay off by the start of the new millennium, with the 2001 Elantra in particular showing massive improvements in overall quality, reliability and performance. Other models followed suit and the desirability of Hyundai cars increased sharply. Providing an extraordinarily long warranty period didn't hurt either. 
Today's lineup is indicative of Hyundai's complete turnaround. Hyundai has a vehicle for nearly every segment, including the economical Accent subcompact, the popular Elantra compact, the midsize Sonata sedan (also available as a hybrid), sporty Genesis and Veloster coupes and a couple of stylish SUVs. Hyundai has also expanded into the entry-level and premium-level luxury sedan markets with its Genesis and Equus sedans. Having gone from being the butt of late-night TV jokes in the 1980s to a well-respected manufacturer of quality vehicles, Hyundai has created a very inspiring rags-to-riches story.

History




The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6 million vehicles annually.


Chung Ju-Yung founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967. The company's first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968.[12] When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former Managing Director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were Kenneth Barnett body design, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite ex-BRM as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer.[13][14][15][16] In 1975, the Pony, the first Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of ItalDesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries.
In 1984, Hyundai exported the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, because the Pony didn't pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built.[17]
In 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as "Best Product #10" by Fortune magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark.[17] In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four-cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence.
In 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India.[18]
In 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju Yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong Koo, in 1999.[19] Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.
In 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in "initial quality" in a survey/study by J.D.

United States
Hyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel, which was offered in a variety of trims and body styles. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.
Initially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for "Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive") and even made David Letterman's Top Ten Hilarious Mischief Night Pranks To Play In Space: No.8 – Paste a "Hyundai" logo on the main control panel.[32]
In response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States. By 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus.[33] Hyundai is ranked number 4 in World's Most Admired Companies under the motor vehicles section of CNN, after BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke), Volkswagen and Daimler in 2011.
Hyundai continues to invest heavily in its American operations as its cars grow in popularity. In 1990, Hyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. Besides the design studio, the facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc. (HATCI, established in 1986), a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2), $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005. Later that same year, HATCI announced that it would be expanding its technical operations in Michigan and hiring 600 additional engineers and other technical employees over a period of five years. The center also has employees in California and Alabama.
Hyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.[34] Currently, the plant assembles the Hyundai Elantra, the Hyundai Sonata, and the Hyundai Theta engine. It is Hyundai's second attempt at producing cars in North America since Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.'s plant in Quebec closed in 1993.
Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California in 2004. The 4,300-acre (17 km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) oval track,[10] a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million. An aerial view can be found here.
In 2003, Consumer Reports, based on complaints about 2002 model new cars that in general are less than one year usage, ranked Hyundai's reliability tied with Honda's; however, J.D. Power and Associates put Hyundai's 2002 vehicles below the industry average according to its annual Initial Quality Survey, which looks at problems in the first 90 days of ownership.[35]
In 2006, J.D. Power and Associates' quality ranking, overall the Hyundai brand ranked 3rd, just behind Porsche and Lexus, and beating longtime rival Toyota.[36] But Hyundai's ranking fell to twelfth in 2007.[37] However, in 2009, Hyundai was the Highest Ranked Non-Premium Nameplate in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study.[38]
In the 2007 Strategic Vision Total Quality Awards, Hyundai Motor leads the most vehicle segments in Strategic Vision's Total Quality Index, measuring the ownership experience. They attempt to measure more than just the number of problems per vehicle. Hyundai tops in Strategic Vision Total Quality Awards. For the first time ever, Hyundai has risen to share the position of having the most models leading a segment. three models with the top Total Quality Index (TQI) score in their segments, including the Hyundai Azera, Entourage, Santa Fe.[39][40]
In 2007 at the New York International Auto Show, Hyundai unveiled its V8 rear-drive luxury sedan called the Concept Genesis to be slotted above the Azera in the Hyundai line-up. This concept made its American debut in mid-2008. The Genesis reintroduced rear-wheel drive to the Hyundai range following a long period of only producing front-wheel drive cars.[41]
In 2007 at the Los Angeles International Auto Show, Hyundai unveiled its second rear-drive concept car, the Concept Genesis Coupe, will be Hyundai's first sports car due to make its debut in early 2009.[42]
In 2008, Hyundai Santa Fe and Hyundai Elantra were awarded 2008 Consumer Reports "top picks". The magazine's annual ratings, based on road tests and predicted safety and reliability are considered highly influential among consumers.[43] The Hyundai Elantra was Consumer Reports' top-ranked 2008 vehicle among 19 other compacts and small family cars, beating out the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Toyota Prius.[44]
In 2008, at the North American International Auto Show, the production version of the luxury & performance-oriented Hyundai Genesis sedan made its debut, dealerships will have the Genesis as soon as summer 2008. In 2008, at the New York International Auto Show, Hyundai debuted its production version of the performance-oriented rear-drive Hyundai Genesis Coupe, slated to hit dealerships in early 2009.
On 6 January, Hyundai reported sales of December 2008 fell to 24,037, from 46,487 in previous year and sales for the year dropped 14%, a day after the company launched 'Hyundai Assurance' in order to spark sales amid tough economic conditions.[45]
In 2009, Hyundai announced the five-door hatchback variant of the Elantra compact sedan will carry the name Elantra Touring when it goes on sale in the spring as a 2009 model.[46]
In 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai.[47] The Genesis has received a number of well-recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000.[48] The Hyundai's V8 Tau engine in the Genesis, which develops 375 hp (280 kW) on premium fuel and 368 hp (274 kW) on regular fuel, received 2009 Ward's 10 Best Engines award.[49]
In 2009, 4 models from Hyundai and two from Kia, earned the Top Safety Award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[50]
In 2009, Hyundai/Kia vehicles were named as "least expensive vehicles to insure". Hyundai/Kia vehicles were the least expensive to insure and occupied the 'top five' least expensive slots, said Insure.com.[51]
In 2009, according to a preliminary report from the Environmental Protection Agency published in November 2009, which is based on 2009 pre-model year production projections provided by automakers,[52] Hyundai, at an average of 23.4 mpg‑US (10.1 L/100 km; 28.1 mpg‑imp), is the second most fuel-efficient automaker in America, after Honda's combined U.S. fleet of Honda and Acura models at an average of 23.6 mpg‑US (10.0 L/100 km; 28.3 mpg‑imp).[53]
In 2010, a Consumer Reports reliability survey ranked Hyundai (including Kia) as the fourth-best automaker. The ratings reflect the performance, comfort, utility and reliability of more than 280 vehicles that the magazine recently tested.[54]
In 2010, the Hyundai Equus made its North American debut at the North American International Auto Show
In January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model's redesigned debut.[55]

In 1989, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131 million.[56] The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week.[56] Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont – only to later announce the deal had failed.[57] The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed – with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada.[58] Hyundai subsequently sold the plant,[58] which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No.1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012.
Mexico
Hyundai Motor México entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the Hyundai Grand i10, the Hyundai Elantra, and the Hyundai ix35.[59] Soon afterwards, the Hyundai Sonata joined the lineup.

Alister McRae driving an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland.


Hyundai entered motorsport by competing in the F2 class of the World Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999. In September 1999, Hyundai unveiled the Accent WRC, a World Rally Car based on the Hyundai Accent. The Hyundai World Rally Team debuted the car at the 2000 Swedish Rally and achieved their first top-ten result at that year's Rally Argentina, when Alister McRae and Kenneth Eriksson finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth.
For the 2002 season, Hyundai hired the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, along with Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's fifth place in New Zealand was the team's best result, but they managed to edge out Škoda and Mitsubishi by one point in the battle for fourth place in the manufacturers' world championship. In September 2003, after a season hampered by budget constraints, Hyundai announced withdrawal from the WRC and planned to return in 2006, which did not happen.[121]
In 2006, following the announcement that Korea was scheduled to earn a Formula One Grand Prix, Hyundai planned to enter the sport.[122] The Korean Grand Prix was first held in 2010, but Hyundai have not entered the championship. Hyundai announced they would be revealing their future rally plans at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show, on February 9.[123] The current plans for rallying are focused around the newest Hyundai release, the Veloster.[124] In September 2012 Hyundai announced that they were due to start the WRC with a rally model of its i20 to rival the likes of the Ford Fiesta, the Citroen DS3 and the Mini Countryman.

The Hyundai i20 WRC is a World Rally Car built by Hyundai for use in the 2014 World Rally Championship.[125] It is based on the Hyundai i20 subcompact car, and was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The launch of the i20 marks Hyundai's return to the World Rally Championship after a ten-year absence.[126] The car is scheduled to make its first competitive appearance at the 2014 Rallye Monte Carlo, but may compete during the 2013 season to aid development.[127]
The car will be operated by Hyundai's performance division, Hyundai Motorsport from a base in Frankfurt, Germany.[128]

Marketing
Live Brilliant
The Live Brilliant global brand campaign started in 2012. That campaign will be an extension of the “Modern Premium” way of thinking that Hyundai adopted as part of their new brand direction. The goal was to seek to deliver the company's aspiration to make each and every moment a customer spends with Hyundai a moment of happiness, filled with brilliant memories. [132][133][134][135]
Corporate social responsibility
In 2008, Hyundai Motors established a committee to oversee its Corporate Social Responsibility programme.[136] Among the programme's initiatives have been the "Happy Move Global Youth Volunteers Program".[137]
The Hyundai Motors' India Foundation (HMIF) has invested more than 20 million rupees in various corporate social responsibility programmes in India. In 2011, it started the "Go Green" village adoption project in Tamil Nadu. Its aim was to promote environmentally friendly products, increase the forest cover in Tamil Nadu, and improve living and hygiene conditions in the region's villages. A number of schools have been adopted for improvement with the HMIF donating around 450 benches to government schools and drilling 10 bore wells.[138]

Controversies
Inflated fuel economy numbers
After an investigation in 2012, the EPA found that 35% of all 2011-2013 Hyundai and Kia vehicles had inflated fuel economy numbers; by as much as six miles per gallon. Currently, Hyundai and Kia have started a reimbursement programme for the owners of the 2011-2013 affected vehicles. [154][155][156]
Wrongly advertised engine and horsepower
Several consumers complained that the engine delivered with the Hyundai Veloster in Brazil was inferior to the one advertised.[157] Independent tests confirmed that it was not the same engine, and it delivered only 121 CV (119 HP) instead of the advertised 140 CV (138 HP), with the car earning derogatory nicknames like Slowster in the Brazilian market.[158]
Marketing controversy
In April 2013, Hyundai Motors UK released a commercial depicting a man attempting to commit suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning in an ix35, only to fail to do so because of the vehicle's non-toxic emissions. The advert, produced by Hyundai's in-house agency Innocean Worldwide, received widespread criticism for promoting suicide.[159] Blogger Holly Brockwell posted an open letter to Innocean and Hyundai, reminding them that her father committed suicide in a similar manner.[160] Hyundai has since taken down the video and issued a formal apology.[159][161]

Hyundai Overview


                        Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) was founded in 1947 as Hyundai 
                        Engineering and Construction Co. by Ju-Yung Chung:
                        


HMC was established in 1967 and is the auto sales leader in the Korean 
                              domestic market and exports vehicles to 193 countries worldwide.
                          The Korean word "hyundai" signifies and reflects Hyundai's commitment 
                              to sell innovative, high-quality vehicles at the most affordable prices.
                          In August 2009, HMC passed Ford to become the 4th-largest auto manufacturer 
                              in the world, outselling Nissan, Honda and Chrysler.
                          HMC operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing plant 
                              in Ulsan, on Korea's southeast coast, and at the Asan Plant, located southeast of Seoul.
                          The Namyang Technology Research Center in Korea includes a complete testing
                              facility, a 2.8-mile oval test track and a $40 million wind tunnel that is capable of 
                              producing wind speeds of nearly 125 miles per hour.

                        Hyundai conducts research at eight research centers in Korea and four international centers, 
                        including the Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc., in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
                        and the Hyundai/Kia Design Center in Irvine, California: 
                        


 Hyundai's automotive technology centers employ approximately 4,100 researchers with an annual 
                          budget of 5% of current revenues.
Hyundai opened its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Montgomery, Alabama, in 2005 with a 
                          capacity of 300,000 vehicles. Its first products were Sonata, starting with 2006, and the 2007 Santa Fe.
The proving ground in the California Mojave desert consists of 4,300 acres, with a 6.4-mile 
                          high-speed oval, 2.75-mile road course and a 3.3-mile hill road.




Current research projects include:



Electric-powered vehicles
Low-emission gasoline engines
Solar-powered vehicles
Hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles
Other alternative fuel vehicles



                          Hyundai Manufacturing in America - "Made in America"



                          Hyundai Motor Corporation's $1.1 billion automotive assembly and manufacturing plant 
                          in Montgomery, Alabama, began production in March 2005, rolling out the all-new 2006 
                          Sonata. This is the company's first assembly and manufacturing plant in the United States: 
                        
It employs approximately 2,000 people in Montgomery and the surrounding area.
Occupying 1,600 acres, it will produce 300,000 vehicles per year at maximum capacity.

                        HMC selected Montgomery, Alabama, for its first U.S. plant because of its high-quality workforce,

Hyundai  Hope on Wheels Program


Funding  Pediatric Cancer Research


                        The story begins in 1998 when a group of New England-area Hyundai dealers launched a local initiative to 
                        raise funds to support pediatric cancer through The Jimmy Fund at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
                        What started as a small contribution in a local market has evolved into Hyundai Hope On Wheels, 
                        an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. With the sale of every new Hyundai vehicle, 
                        Hyundai and our dealers make a contribution to Hyundai Hope On Wheels.
                        

                        We would like to thank Hyundai and its dealers for their unwavering support as  well as the doctors, 
                        researchers and hospital staffs for their tireless 
                        work.  And we especially thank the children and families affected by cancer for their  tremendous 
                        courage and strength that inspires us every day!
                        

                        The Hyundai Scholar Grant program began in 2006. Each year, Hyundai Hope On Wheels visits
                        children’s hospitals across the U.S. to donate funds and raise awareness. At every grant presentation, a
                        “Handprint Ceremony” takes place. This is the program’s signature activity, which captures each child’s
                        handprint. These handprints are placed on Hyundai cars that travel across the country to build colorful
                        awareness of the program.
                        

                        In 2011, Hyundai Hope On Wheels made a $10 million, 5-year commitment to establish the Hyundai
                        Cancer Institute at CHOC Children's Hospital in Orange County, CA. This gift is the largest in the hospital's
                        history, and has made special pediatric cancer projects possible. 
                        Hyundai Hope on Wheels 2016 Program


                        March 24, 2016 marks 18 years of commitment and a total of $115 million donated in its pledge to end 
                        childhood cancer. On the sidelines of the 
                        New York International Auto Show, the organization will recognize child cancer survivors, families, 
                        doctors, nurses and supporters 
                        at its award ceremony themed, “A Day Without Pediatric Cancer.” Aubrey Peeples, film and TV actress 
                        known for her roles in 
                        Nashville and Jem and the Holograms, has been named this year’s HHOW Celebrity Ambassador and 
                        will co-host the event. This year alone, 
                        the organization will award $13 million in new pediatric cancer research grants. 
                        



                        This year’s vehicle of Hope is a 2017 Hyundai Tucson, which will travel the nation with the 
                        handprints of child cancer survivors. Beginning June 1st, we will travel across the nation 
                        presenting over $13 million in grant awards at unique Handprint Ceremonies. HHOW collects handprints, 
                        which represent the brave and courageous pediatric cancer fighters and shows them that they are not alone. 
                        



 Meet our 2016-2017 National Youth Ambassadors


                        Two local childhood cancer survivors, were selected as the organization’s 2016-2017 National Youth Ambassadors. 
                        The children, Hannah Adams and Ryan Darby, were recognized at the annual HHOW reception, which took place on 
                        March 24, 2016 and was themed, “A Day Without Pediatric Cancer.”
                        



 
                        Hannah, a 12-year-old from Middleburg, FL, and Ryan, a 12-year-old from Bethesda, MD, were selected 
                        from a nationwide search. 
                        For the next two years, they will join HHOW in its mission to fight childhood cancer and will travel around the U.S. 
                        visiting children’s hospitals and attending events to tell their stories of courage and hope.
