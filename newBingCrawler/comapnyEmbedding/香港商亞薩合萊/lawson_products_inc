I am sure it is most likely due to the fault of our⋯⋯ local post office that the product was never received but Lawson has been absolutely no help in the matter at all. Today I received a collections letter. It isn't about the cost of the product the bill is only $156.25 but the principle of the matter is I can not pay for a product that I never received. Horrible customer service from their billing department. I will not use any more Lawson products, not a big loss to such a large company but they clearly do not care about helping their customers. 更多Clay Malloy · 20 小時前Lawson Products are best. Dean Nunn is a great sales rep.  Lawson Has the best products My Late Father dealt with this Company 20 years plus.Shannon Hillygus · 2017年2月3日Extremely unethical business practices! Sales representative never provided a proposal or estimate for product before shipping product to our property.  The pro⋯⋯perty left order unopened awaiting an estimate or invoice.  The sales representative came to the property and opened and stocked all product and still did not produce an invoice or estimate just claimed, "don't worry, we are very competitive."  When invoice arrived for over $6000 of product, the product was billed at 2 - 4 times higher that HD Supply, Grainger and other used vendors.  The sales manager also tried to bill the property for items that were not ordered and were clearly labeled as, "Sample Not for Resale". We requested reasonable pricing consideration or return of product and were told that they do not accept returns.  To date, Lawson Products has not resolved this matter and refuses to take their product back.  We have been disputing this order since mid December! 更多Buddy Kalish · 2016年10月27日I started at LAWSON in 1956, a store front at 1923 S Indiana Ave. We had 8 employees.. 3 in the office and 5 in the back(warehouse). I picked up parts locally, ⋯⋯filled, packed orders and delivered to the Post Office, using the bosses car...1957 Dodge. I worked for the finest man, Sidney L. Port(Founder). After 43 years (1999), I retired as Chairman, CEO. Do you think I liked my job ? It was a dream come true. Today, LAWSON is still a great company. Bernard(Buddy)Kalish 更多Scott Garman · 2016年10月18日I have been dealing with Lawson for years. Have a great salesman who handles my account. A couple of weeks ago I order a A35 rack to add on to the wall of 40+ r⋯⋯acks I currently have. They are 6 high so they need to be bolted together. I unpack it, set it up and go to bolt it to the stack. THE BOLT HOLES DON'T LINE UP. Okay, I got a different rack then I ordered so I check. Nope, A35. Call my salesman. He's stumped but will look into it. He comes in yesterday and says the racks are made by a different vendor now. Okay, but what about the holes not lining up? He was told they are much better racks and if you want to bolt them together I will have to "drill my own set of holes"!! Hello Lawson, Are you kidding? Didn't ANYONE check this out. You do realize what a royal pain in the ass it is to re-drill the holes INSIDE the cabinet?? Never mind the time wasted...... Murphy's law states that " the stupidity of ones actions is directly proportional to the amount of people watching...." Well, your customer base is watching....... 更多William Stewart III · 2015年9月21日The perfect solution to keep you on your job doing what you do to make your company money.
