Tested safety
The German GS mark is a voluntary safety mark. It is not a universal quality seal, but is meant to ensure that the technical requirements for the safety of a product are met and will be monitored by an independent testing company such as TÜV Rheinland. All effects of the product on health and safety of humans are covered by the tests. Very different tests may be necessary, depending on the product.
The manufacturer must arrange for the product to receive a so-called "type test" by an evaluation body such as TÜV Rheinland. TÜV Rheinland carries out the required tests in recognised laboratories worldwide.
TÜV Rheinland performs checks to maintain the certification. Tests are carried out to ascertain whether the manufactured product still conforms to the tested type or whether changes have been made. Such inspections, which usually take place on an annual basis, also include a control of the quality system as well as the final examination. The aim is to determine whether mass production can ensure the safety requirements for the product.
The award of the GS mark is governed by the Product Safety Act and limited to a maximum of five years. It expires automatically if there is any change to the tested product.
Certified products may be labelled with the GS mark.

Ihr Projekt-Baumarkt mit Onlineshop


 
HORNBACH ist Herzblut für all jene Menschen, die sich nicht scheuen anzupacken, wenn es drauf ankommt. Unsere Leidenschaft gilt jenen, die mit der Kraft ihrer Hände Neues schaffen oder Altes verbessern, die sich nicht von Schwielen an den Händen oder schmerzenden Schultern aufhalten lassen, die gerne für ihr Vorhaben schwitzen und solange schrauben, sägen, hämmern, streichen, pflanzen, ... bis sie sehen, dass es gut war. Wo ein solch starker Wille ist, da ist auch ein Baumarkt. Täglich ziehen tausende Mitarbeiter bei HORNBACH an einem Strang – in den Bau- und Gartenmärkten und in unserem Onlineshop. Unsere Mission lautet, Menschen bei ihren Projekten in Haus und Garten zur Seite zu stehen. Darum ist HORNBACH nach wie vor die Nr. 1, wenn’s um Projekte geht!Wir spüren es: Sie sind heiß darauf, für etwas zu schwitzen und zu brennen. Jetzt ist die ideale Jahreszeit dafür gekommen. In den Sommermonaten sind die Tage länger für Taten. Es bleibt also Zeit für viele Projekte rund um Haus und Garten. Wie wäre es mit neuem Gartenmöbel für Ihre Terrasse, auf dem Sie sich nach getaner Arbeit erholen können? Finden Sie bei uns auch die passende Markise oder den passenden Sonnenschirm, das richtige Sonnensegel oder anderen Sonnenschutz für außen. Sie brauchen Abkühlung zwischendurch? Bei uns finden Sie Ihre neue Gartendusche, Klimageräte oder Ventilatoren. Als Hitze- und Sonnenschutz für Innenräume können Sie sich bei HORNBACH Ihr Plissee nach Maß, Rollo nach Maß oder Ihre Jalousie nach Maß online oder im Markt konfigurieren.

 HORNBACH online: Sortiment & Projektwissen
Starke Projekte erfordern professionelle Maschinen und Werkzeuge. Eine gute Ausrüstung lässt die Herzen von Handwerkern und Heimwerkern höher schlagen – bei HORNBACH bekommen Sie alles – vom Akkuschrauber über Eisenwaren bis hin zu Gartenwerkzeugen und Gartenmaschinen. Rüsten Sie sich frühzeitig für den Sommer. Eine gute Gartenbewässerung ist zum Beispiel für Ihre Pflanzen und Ihren Rasen lebenswichtig in den heißen Monaten. Wir bieten Ihnen viele Möglichkeiten, Ihren Garten zu bewässern, zu pflegen oder auch neu zu gestalten. Im Sommer darf natürlich vor allem eins nicht fehlen: Das Zeug zum Grillen! Finden Sie bei uns den Grill, der zu Ihnen passt. Egal, was Sie anpacken wollen, im HORNBACH Baumarkt und im HORNBACH Onlineshop sind Sie immer richtig: Ob Sie ein Aquarium kaufen wollen oder ein Gartenhaus bauen wollen. Unser Sortiment ist umfangreich! Es umfasst Bodenbeläge aller Art wie Laminat oder Teppichboden sowie Wandfarben, Tapeten oder Verblender. Hier finden Sie alle Baustoffe, die Sie für Projekte brauchen, z. B. alles zum Thema Dämmung oder zur Gartengestaltung.Bei HORNBACH beraten wir Sie bei allen Projekten rund ums Bauen, Renovieren, Wohnen und den Garten – wir zeigen, wie’s geht und Sie packen’s an! Mit unseren Projekten wie zum Beispiel Möbelbau wachsen Sie über sich hinaus: Sie haben das handwerkliche Geschick, wir das Fachwissen!
