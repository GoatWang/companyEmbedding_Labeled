Clas Ohlson AB



23/05/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 23/05/2017 13:02
The winner of Clas Ohlson Product Innovation Challenge is appointed!








        2017-05-23 08:00 CET
      


        The Clas Ohlson Product Innovation Challenge is completed, and the winning contribution is 'Altered:Nozzle', the tap nozzle that reduces water consumption by up to 98%. This winning product will be launched by the end of June 2017, and be available in all of Clas Ohlson's markets and sales channels.
      

        All too often, we leave the tap running while we perform our daily routines, say when brushing our teeth, doing dishes, washing our hands, cooking - as if water were an endless resource. The winners of Clas Ohlson Product Innovation Challenge have developed a new type of nozzle that easily fits into your existing tap, and that can save up to 98% of water with full functionality maintained. The product is called Altered:Nozzle.
      

        'Most of us take water for granted. But over 1.5 billion people on our planet are lacking of water, and this figure will climb to affect 40% of the Earth's population by the year 2020. We see these effects in Sweden too, on Gotland, for example. Altered:Nozzle is our small solution to a large and growing global challenge', says Johan Nihlén, one of the cofounders and CEO of Altered.
      

        'Using an ordinary tap, water pours out and most of it just passes through your hands or bounces off of your dinner plates. Every day, billions of litres of fresh water goes straight into the drain. By atomizing the water we increase the areal of the water, which means that you can get hold of every single drop that comes out of your tap. This means that you can wash your hands, brush your teeth, rinse your vegetables and do your dishes using only a fraction of the water that a tap would normally produce', says Johan.
      

        The nozzle is equipped with adapters, making it suitable for all common tap sizes.
      

        'Through the products we sell and the knowledge we supply, we can change attitudes and behaviours with our consumers. With Altered:Nozzle we can help our customers save water, save energy and save money', says Eva Berg, Assortment Manager at Clas Ohlson.
      

        Clas Ohlson Product Innovation Challenge is aimed to help Clas Ohlson in finding new and innovative products to help customers towards a more sustainable lifestyle. This is a part of Clas Ohlson's sustainability efforts, and a part of Clas Ohlson's journey From here to sustainability.
