      working capital. Andrew Prince, retiring CEO and Vice Chairman of the 
      board of directors, said, "The Board of Directors unanimously concluded 
      that this transaction was in the best interests of Precision and its

      2012. Precision is poised for a new era of growth." Richard McVaugh will 
      become President of Precision effective immediately. “I look forward to 
      strengthening relationships with customers and vendors to execute on the 
      new strategic plans,” said McVaugh.
    

      Mr. Prince will continue to advise the Company as a member of the board 
      of directors for at least a year. The Company will appoint John F.

      Precision, and I am honored to serve during the transition period," said 
      Mr. Wachter.

      directors. Regarding the transaction, Mr. Wachter said, "Bill and I have

      discussed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed March 29,

High performance aerospace grade components

 


A supplier to many of the world’s leading equipment manufacturers for more than 28 years, our components can be found on many of the world’s most advanced commercial airliners and military aircraft.

 



Precision with agility

 


Using the latest CNC technologies, PACE turns and mills precision components from a comprehensive range of aerospace materials to diameters of between 1mm and 250mm, within the most exacting tolerances.
If the quality of our manufacturing can be expected of a company of our pedigree, our flexible approach to component supply might not.

 



Long term partnerships

 


We are unusual as a manufacturer in the choice that we offer our customers through which they can take delivery of their components – including kitting, kanban, consignment stocking and direct line feed supply – allowing them to simplify their supply chain logistics.

 



Dedicated customer focus

 


Engineering excellence, outstanding manufacturing performance, rigorous production processes and attention to detail, customer care and flexibility of supply combine to create a reputation that goes beyond our name – Precision Aerospace Component Engineering.
