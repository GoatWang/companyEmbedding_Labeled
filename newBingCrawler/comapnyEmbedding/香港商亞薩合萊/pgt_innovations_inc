Interesting PGTI Put And Call Options For November 17th
Investors in PGT Innovations Inc saw new options begin trading this week, for the November 17th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 192 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

	VENICE, Fla., February 21, 2017 – PGT Innovations, Inc. (NYSE: PGTI), the leading U.S. manufacturer and supplier of impact-resistant windows and doors, announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.



	 



	“PGT Innovations had an exciting year of growth and change in 2016. Our team delivered record sales of $459 million for the year, with 18 percent growth,” commented PGT Innovations’ Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rod Hershberger. “We continued to take share and outgrow Florida single-family housing starts, which grew a healthy 15 percent for the year. In part, this share gain and revenue growth was made possible by the WinDoor acquisition, which is aligned with our long-term growth strategy. While we did see softness in the high-end market in 2016, we believe this acquisition has us well positioned as the high-end market returns.”



	 



	“The underlying drivers of Florida’s population expansion, rational pricing, and consumer confidence is leading to a steady market recovery for both new construction and repair and remodeling activities,” Hershberger continued. “During 2016, Florida’s population grew faster than at any time in the last six years, which continued to drive Florida’s economic growth with the single largest factor being the continued recovery in housing.”



	 



	Hershberger added, “Slower home-price appreciation is aiding affordability, as home builder confidence continues to soar, leading builders to respond to increasing demand for newly constructed homes. We expect this to have increasingly broader ripple effects on the supply chain for all new-home construction materials, including windows and doors.”



	 



	Hershberger concluded, “The stock markets continue to set records, and every measure of consumer sentiment indicates consumer confidence is at near record highs. We are looking forward to the spring 2017 home buying season.”

	“Sales of $110 million set a fourth-quarter record for our Company, led by our legacy brand, PGT Custom Windows and Doors,” commented Jeff Jackson, PGT Innovations’ President. “We were able to leverage our competencies to capture growth in the mass custom market. We expanded our vinyl capacity to capitalize on this market dynamic, and were able to realize strong growth in our impact vinyl products, which grew by 44 percent compared to last year’s fourth quarter.”




	 




	Jackson continued, “Our second new Thermal Plastic Spacer (TPS) system, which is an innovative and cutting-edge technology that we believe will enable us to produce better quality insulated glass units, was fully operational as of October 2016. Our first TPS system came online in September 2016.”



	 



	“As we move further into 2017, our three brands are continuing to operate more effectively as one company, providing best-in-class solutions to our customers,” Jackson commented,  “In January, at the International Builders Show in Orlando, we unveiled a comprehensive three brand go-to-market strategy with newly-enhanced brand positions. We showcased new products, which we plan to launch later this year, such as WinDoor’s lift-and-slide door, and bi-fold door. We also gave a glimpse into our research and development pipeline, which includes state-of-the-art hardware solutions and several other innovative product designs.”



	 




	“We believe these investments in our brands, combined with operational investments, provide a foundation to support expected growth that will generate long-term value for the shareholders of PGT Innovations,” stated Jackson.

	“On February 13, 2017, we announced the repricing of our $264 million term loan facility, which reduced our annual interest rate by one full percentage-point,” said Brad West, PGT Innovations’ Chief Financial Officer. “This repricing will benefit us in several ways during 2017, including lowering interest expense, adding to free cash flow, and adding to our bottom line and per share earnings.”



	 



	Mr. West continued, “For 2017, we expect full-year sales to range between $490 and $500 million, representing an increase of between 7 and 9 percent. We expect sales in this range will generate consolidated EBITDA of between $83 and $87 million.”

	Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures





	 



	This Press Release and the financial schedules include financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We believe that presentation of non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides investors and analysts with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance compared to past performance. We also believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with a better baseline for assessing our future earnings potential. The non-GAAP measures included in this release are provided to give investors access to types of measures that we use in analyzing our results.



	 



	Adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. Adjusted net income per share consists of GAAP net income per share adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. We believe these measures enable investors and analysts to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to the past performance and provide a better baseline for assessing the Company's future earnings potential. However, these measures do not provide a complete picture of our operations.



	 



	EBITDA consists of GAAP net income adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation. We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and analysts about the Company's performance because they eliminate the effects of period-to-period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital investments and interest expense. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not give effect to the cash the Company must use to service its debt or pay its income taxes and thus do not reflect the funds generated from operations or actually available for capital investments.



	 



	Our calculations of adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly titled measures. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP measures. Schedules that reconcile adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income are included in the financial schedules accompanying this release.

	(2) Represents fair value adjustment resulting in the reversal of the liability for the earn-out contingency of $3 million established in the acquisition of WinDoor on February 16, 2016. The stock purchase agreement provided for a potential additional payment to the sellers based on WinDoor’s 2016 calendar-year sales. If WinDoor’s 2016 sales reached $46 million, the additional payment was 5.9% of sales, or $2.7 million, up to a maximum sales amount of $51 million, or $3 million.  If WinDoor’s 2016 calendar-year sales were less than $46 million, no payment was required. Based on WinDoor’s sales through the end of the 2016 second quarter, we believed that WinDoor would achieve 2016 calendar-year sales of at least the minimum sales level of $46 million requiring payment under the arrangement. Therefore, we made no adjustment to our payable for contingent consideration. However, based on WinDoor’s sales through the end of the third quarter of 2016, we concluded that it was unlikely that WinDoor’s 2016 calendar-year sales would reach $46 million, and as required by the accounting rules, in the third quarter of 2016 we recorded a fair value adjustment of $3.0 million to the liability for contingent consideration, which is included in income from operations in the year ended December 31, 2016. WinDoor's 2016 calendar-year sales did not reach at least $46 million.








	 








	(3) Represents costs and expenses relating to our February 16, 2016, acquisition of WinDoor, Inc., and simultaneous refinancing of our then existing credit facility into the 2016 Credit Agreement, as well as the minor acquisition completed in the 2016 third quarter. Of the $4.6 million, $3.4 million represents and is classified as debt extinguishment costs, and $902 thousand represents transaction- and refinancing-related costs and expenses classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016. Costs of $299 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2016, represent post-acquisition costs and are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in both periods.








	 








	(4) Represents product line relocation costs relating to the execution of planned manufacturing efficiency strategies, $143 thousand of which is classified within cost of sales and $180 thousand of which is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The remaining $1.1 million represents product discontinuances in the first nine months of 2016, including our Architectural Systems aluminum and PremierVue vinyl impact products, of which $833 thousand is classified within cost of sales, and $275 thousand is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016.








	 








	(5) Represents operating costs and inefficiencies associated with conversion to new ERP system, of which $2.2 million is included in cost of sales in the three months ended January 2, 2016, and $3.8 million is included in cost of sales and $47 thousand is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended January 2, 2016. Of the $2.2 million, $1.5 million relates to incremental insulated glass purchase costs, $430 thousand relates to additional material costs and $350 thousand relates to labor inefficiencies.  Of the $3.8 million, $1.9 million relates to incremental insulated glass purchase costs, $826 thousand relates to additional material costs and $1.1 million relates to labor inefficiencies.








	 








	(6) Represents costs associated with new product launches, of which $242 thousand in the three months ended and $1.1 million in the year ended January 2, 2016, is included in cost of sales, and $304 thousand is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended January 2, 2016.








	 








	(7) In 2016, represents costs associated with the start-up of our two new Thermal Plastic Spacer system insulated glass lines, all of which is classified within cost of sales in the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, represents costs associated with start-up of the then new laminated glass line, all of which is included in cost of sales in the year ended January 2, 2016.

	At PGT Innovations, we create long-term value through committing to companies that share our standards of integrity, innovation and growth. Our competitive advantage lies in our collective commitment to continuously researching, reimagining, developing and manufacturing the best products possible. We are proud to have the following companies in the PGT Innovations family.

	CGI

	Formed in 1992 to offer highly engineered products for custom applications, CGI Windows & Doors is now a premier manufacturer of hurricane impact resistant windows and doors. Produced to the most exacting industry standards, their high performance, high aesthetic product collections offer advanced hurricane protection of home and commercial structures, in both new and existing construction. In addition to using impact-resistant laminated glass and the finest hardware, their aluminum and vinyl windows and doors exude strength and beauty—a function of their workmanship, pride and engineering excellence.

	PGT Industries

	Founded in 1980, PGT Industries is the nation’s leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors. After the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the company partnered with building officials in Miami-Dade and helped develop construction code requirements which are still among the most stringent in the nation.

	 PGT Industries employs approximately 2,200 team members as of September 2, 2014 at its manufacturing, glass plant and delivery fleet facilities in Venice, Florida, and sells through a network of independent distributors. The company’s total line of custom windows and doors are now sold throughout the eastern U.S. and a growing international market, including the Caribbean, South America and Australia.

	WinDoor

	WinDoor’s craftsmanship, attention to detail and ultra-high-performance ratings have made them the product of choice for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums and celebrity mansions along the U.S. coastline for over 15 years. Manufacturing from their 320,000 square foot facility in Orlando, Florida, their aluminum, vinyl and thermally-broken I-strut aluminum products are AAMA, ASTM and Miami-Dade, Florida approvals & TDI approved products are always available in expansive sizes, custom colors and custom configurations.
