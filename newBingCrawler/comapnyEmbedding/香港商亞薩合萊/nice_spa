Three Methods:Showing Enthusiasm for the ProductConnecting with the BuyerSelling Products as an Owner SalespersonCommunity Q&A
Selling a product doesn’t have to be complicated. At its most basic level, a sales program is defined principally by what you sell, who you sell it to and how you sell it. Beyond that, sales involves staying focused on the details of your product and customers. As a sales program continues you will want to keep paying attention to changing trends and the needs or desires of your customers. By observing these changes you will be able to adjust your program and keep your sales strong.







Steps


Method 1

Showing Enthusiasm for the Product







1

Study your product.[1] If you are able to convey knowledge about the product, and to answer questions that customers may have, then they will understand that you really care about the product. If you find the product worthwhile, they are more likely to as well.


It is absolutely vital to know your product inside out. If you do not know something a customer asks of you, try saying something like “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?”









2

Emphasize the perks of the product to customers. As well as getting good product information to the right people, it is important to translate the product's features into benefits. This makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product. Think about things like:[2]

Will the product make the customer’s life easier?
Will the product create a sense of luxury?
Is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people?
Is the product something that can be used for a long time?








3

Ensure that the product has been adequately explained. If you are not doing direct, person-to-person sales, then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and any marketing materials.[3] Even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch, having good product information on display will help you convince customers.[4][5]

Make sure that all product information is informative, true, and complete.
Make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear, direct, and easy to read.
Invest the time and money to ensure that your product, packaging, and marketing materials look good—high-quality photos, vivid colors, etc.










Method 2

Connecting with the Buyer







1

Share your love of the product.[6][7] A good salesperson believes in the product that is being sold, and transfers this enthusiasm to the customer. There are numerous ways to show your love of a product.


Don’t neglect body language and tone. You will convey energy and enthusiasm if you speak clearly about a product, and show expression when discussing it. On the other hand, if you mumble when customers ask questions about a product, or cross your arms over your chest, then it will appear like you are distant and don’t care about the product.
Be prepared to discuss how you use the product, or how other satisfied customers have. Specific stories about the product make it relatable to customers. For instance, if you’re selling a shampoo, you can tell a customer something like: “My hair is usually so frizzy, but ever since I’ve started using this it’s been as smooth and straight as it is right now.”








2

Anticipate your customers’ motivations.[8]. You want to be able to answer any questions that customers may have about a product, but even more importantly, you want to anticipate those questions. This shows that you understand customer needs. Make sure that you are able to connect emotionally with customers by addressing those needs.[9]

Think about your typical customers. What motivates them? What needs do they have? Are they young? Single? Wealthy? Do they have families?
Once you have an idea of your customers in mind, think about how your product can help them meet their needs or reach their desires.








3

Practice breaking the ice with customers. If you are working in direct sales, the way you connect with people is critical. Instead of asking the close-ended question "May I help you?,” ask the more positive, open-ended questions like "Are you looking for something for yourself? Or a gift for someone special?"[10] In addition, be ready to make remarks about your product that will interest customers and start deeper conversations. For instance, if you are in clothing retail, you might say: “You know, ugly Christmas sweater parties are really popular right now. Have you ever been to one?”








4

Convert the customer's motivations into the product's characteristics. In marketing, this is known as "positioning," and it consists of equating the product with the customer's hopes and desires. A number of factors are important when positioning a product[11]:


Position the product in the best spectrum of the market possible. Don’t pitch the product too high or too low in terms of affordability and luxury.
Position the facts about the product according to the person you're selling it to. You may have a handful of different facts, but it's up to your skill to know which of those facts best serve each individual sale.
Don't fudge facts or lie outright. Product positioning is about perception, not deception.
Position the facts so that they transcend the product itself. This means that the desirable, positive values associated with the product are what sell it. Companies that excel at this include Coca-Cola, Apple, and many designer goods or labels. Think about how your product will connect with a customer’s lifestyle or values, and not simply serve a function.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a relatively high-end minivan to a wealthy older person, you might mention its luxurious features. Do this by saying things like: “Take a look at that wood trim—it’s just beautiful. And those soft leather seats—they’re so comfortable. They’re perfect for taking a nice sunset drive.”
If you were trying to sell the same minivan to a family with three children, however, you would emphasize its more utilitarian features. For example, you could say things like: “The third seat adds lots of room for carting friends around. It also folds down when you need room for hauling groceries, sporting gear, and things like that. And did I mention that side air bags and anti-lock brakes come standard?”








5

Be honest about your product. Long-term lovers of your product will only come about if you've been honest with them. This means being transparent in your delivery of product information and also admitting your own lack of knowledge or mistakes you've made. Don't be afraid of honesty; it builds trust.


If you ever are not able to answer customers’ questions or supply them with what they need, offer to follow up with them later, as soon as you are able to.
Make sure customers know they can come back to you later if they have questions or concerns.
If it ever turns out that a product isn’t right for a customer, be honest about it and help the customer find what he or she really needs.[12] Even if you don’t make the sale today, your honesty and generosity will be remembered, and can translate into future sales.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a sports car to customer who eventually tells you that he has five young children who he drives to school everyday, you could say something like: “Well maybe you’d be better off with a good minivan or SUV. But if you’re ever in the market for a second vehicle, come back and talk to me and I’ll help you get a good deal.”








6

Close the sale. There are many styles and methods of closing a sale, but one of the most effective has the mnemonic, ABC: "Always Be Closing."[13] As you confirm your prospective buyer's interest in the product, put forward trial closes like, "Does this sound like the product you want?" or “So what do you think? Will this meet your needs?”








7

Give customers time to consider. Appearing overly pushy is a turn-off for many buyers.[14] They may want to go home and do a quick online search for more information. Let them do so with your enthusiastic and supportive pitch in mind. If you've been truthful, helpful, considerate, and enthusiastic, and the information you've given them matches with what they read online, they are likely to come back to your product.


Sometimes, it pays to let your customers take the lead. Give them time to consider, and keep quiet while they do. Only offer more information when they request it.[15]

Don’t let customers get away without knowing how to contact you. If you are working in a store or on site, make sure customers will know how to find you again (especially if you will be moving around). Make sure to tell customers something like "I'll be right here at the counter if you need me," or "Just ask any sales associate to page me if you have any questions."
You can also give customers your contact information so they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want more information. Slip the customer your business card or other contact information and say something: "Call me anytime if you have questions, and you can also find me right here in the store on weekdays."
Use your instincts. If you think a customer is close to buying, stay nearby without being intrusive. You’ll want the customer to be able to find you quickly. The last thing you want is for a potential buyer to decide to purchase and then be unable to find you.

Selling Products as an Owner Salesperson







1

Familiarize yourself with all aspects that feed into the end sale of a product. As an owner salesperson, that is, one who owns the business that is selling the product, you have the ability to affect more than just the interaction with buyers. In addition to the strategies mentioned in the rest of this article, you can also use other functions to improve your sales. Advertising, merchandising, and marketing are support functions for sales.[16] Selling is the goal of these support functions and a good owner salesperson needs to have a decent understanding of each of these.



Read basic texts on marketing. These will inform you about many of the tactics and techniques underlying advertising, merchandising, and marketing.








2

Market your product. It is important to make your product information available through as many channels as possible. Today, the range of potential placements has increased a great deal thanks to the advances in communications. Give your potential buyers many possible places to find out more about your product in numerous ways, such as:


Word-of-mouth
Advertising (radio, TV, print, email, social media, online ads, etc.)
Sales representatives
Trade shows
Conferences
Cold call sales
Product placement in movies, sports, etc.
Local community events (for instance, donating a product to a local benefit auction will draw attention to your product and serve a good cause)[17][18]









3

Review your sales performance.[19][20] You should analyze your sales at regular intervals. Is the product selling well? Is stock low or high? Are you profiting? How are your competitors performing? Being able to answer these questions will help you maximize your sales, and keep growth steady.








4

Troubleshoot sales, if necessary. If you are not selling well, you will need to enter problem-solving mode. Improving your sales will involve reassessing your product, customer base, and marketing.[21]

Change your tactics periodically. If customers hear the same sales routine over and over again, or see the same display month in and month out, your product might start to seem irrelevant.
Consider deleting a product from your line if it is not selling well. Stock can be sold at discounted prices to liquidate it.
Review your target market and sharpen your sales focus. Your buyers might be changing, and you will want to keep up with them, or else find a new market.
Re-evaluate the product design, distribution, packaging, etc. Tweaking the product with your target market and sales strategy in mind can improve your sales.
Change the price of your product. By studying your sales data and competitors’ performance, you may be able to tell if you are charging too much or too little for your product.
Make the product exclusive, or available for a limited time only. Sometimes, controlling supply in this way will increase demand and sales. Make sure that this tactic works with your overall sales strategy, however. If you are marketing a product as perfect for everyday use, it may not work to also market it as exclusive.

Consider the features of the boots and the benefit they provide to potential buyers. Focus on those features that bring the greatest value to the buyer such as utility, low price, extended life and durability, appearance, and status. Whether sold online or in a store, the customer always seeks the greatest value/cost advantage.

What should I do when I am a beginner in a sales job?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

Look to the older and more experienced salespeople at the business for advice and try to emulate their behavior around customers. Make as many sales attempts as you can and actively learn from your mistakes by writing them down and seeking ways to correct them. Above all, don't get discouraged; making sales is difficult and nerve-wracking in the beginning, but gets easier over time.

How do you deal with a customer who always wants a bargain?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

Any customer would like to negotiate with you on the price or services that are being provided. To close the deal with such customers who always bargain, you need to instill a sense in customer that the current price for goods or services being offered is the best. If you have anything to throw in, that can sometimes stop their requests, but if you can show it's the best price in town already, that is your best chances of shutting down the bargaining.

How can we understand customer behavior?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

The best way to understand customers is to put yourself in their shoes. If you were about to buy your product, what would you want to know more about? What would you be worried about? What would your other options be? Take the time to consider the buying process from the customer's point of view and then use this knowledge to improve your selling techniques.

How do I sell bank products?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

Bank products, like certificates of deposit (CDs) and savings accounts, are generally only sold by the bank providing the product. To sell a bank product, you will have to work for the bank. Then, you'll have to meet with clients, understand their financial needs, and work to solve them by providing your bank products. Bank products are sold by displaying credibility and trustworthiness to the customer.

Marketing Theories – The Marketing Mix – From 4 P’s to 7 P’s











Marketing Theories – The Marketing Mix – From 4 P’s to 7 P’s
Visit our Marketing Theories Page to see more of our marketing buzzword busting blogs. 
Marketing is a continually evolving discipline and as such can be one that companies find themselves left very much behind the competition if they stand still for too long. One example of this evolution has been the fundamental changes to the basic Marketing mix. Where once there were 4 P’s to explain the mix, nowadays it is more commonly accepted that a more developed 7 P’s adds a much needed additional layer of depth to the Marketing Mix with some theorists going even going further.
Before we get carried away though what is the Marketing Mix and what is the original 4 P’s principle?
The Marketing Mix
Simply put the Marketing Mix is a tool used by businesses and Marketers to help determine a product or brands offering. The 4 P’s have been associated with the Marketing Mix since their creation by E. Jerome McCarthy in 1960 (You can see why there may have been some need to update the theory).
The Marketing Mix 4 P’s:

Product - The Product should fit the task consumers want it for, it should work and it should be what the consumers are expecting to get.


Place – The product should be available from where your target consumer finds it easiest to shop. This may be High Street, Mail Order or the more current option via e-commerce or an online shop.


Price – The Product should always be seen as representing good value for money. This does not necessarily mean it should be the cheapest available; one of the main tenets of the marketing concept is that customers are usually happy to pay a little more for something that works really well for them.


Promotion – Advertising, PR, Sales Promotion, Personal Selling and, in more recent times, Social Media are all key communication tools for an organisation. These tools should be used to put across the organisation’s message to the correct audiences  in the manner they would most like to hear, whether it be informative or appealing to their emotions.

In the late 70’s it was widely acknowledged by Marketers that the Marketing Mix should be updated. This led to the creation of the Extended Marketing Mix in 1981 by Booms & Bitner which added 3 new elements to the 4 P’s Principle. This now allowed the extended Marketing Mix to include products that are services and not just physical things.
The extended 7 P’s:

People – All companies are reliant on the people who run them from front line Sales staff to the Managing Director. Having the right people is essential because they are as much a part of your business offering as the products/services you are offering.


Processes –The delivery of your service is usually done with the customer present so how the service is delivered is once again part of what the consumer is paying for.


Physical Evidence – Almost all services include some physical elements even if the bulk of what the consumer is paying for is intangible. For example a hair salon would provide their client with a completed hairdo and an insurance company would give their customers some form of printed material. Even if the material is not physically printed (in the case of PDF’s) they are still receiving a “physical product” by this definition.

Though in place since the 1980’s the 7 P’s are still widely taught due to their fundamental logic being sound in the marketing environment and marketers abilities to adapt the Marketing Mix to include changes in communications such as social media, updates in the places which you can sell a product/service or customers expectations in a constantly changing commercial environment.
Is there an 8th P?
In some spheres of thinking, there are 8 P’s in the Marketing Mix. The final P is Productivity and Quality. This came from the old Services Marketing Mix and is folded in to the Extended Marketing Mix by some marketers so what does it mean?
The 8th P of the Marketing Mix:

Productivity & Quality - This P asks “is what you’re offering your customer a good deal?” This is less about you as a business improving your own productivity for cost management, and more about how your company passes this onto its customers.

Even after 31 years (or 54 in the case of the original P’s) the Marketing Mix is still very much applicable to a marketer’s day to day work. A good marketer will learn to adapt the theory to fit with not only modern times but their individual business model.
At Professional Academy the Marketing Mix is used across all of our marketing qualifications and first taught as part of the CIM Foundation Certificate in Professional Marketing but every level of qualification there are nods back to the Marketing Mix P’s in some way shape or form so making them key knowledge for any marketer to be used alongside other Marketing theories such as SWOT Analysis, PESTEL Theory, the Boston Consulting Group Matrix and Stakeholder Mapping.

PERFECT BLENDS
ALL THE DIFFERENT ORIGINS OF COFFEE
From plantations all around the world, Lavazza selects the best coffees to create the numerous blends that we enjoy every day.






COFFEE RECIPES
ESPRESSO MARTINI
Lavazza’s Training Centre reinvented the Espresso Martini using Frangelico, a traditional Piedmontese liqueur.






COFFEE RECIPES
ESPRESSO TIRAMISÙ 
The fluffy egg-free mascarpone cream combines with the coarse texture of “paste di meliga” biscuits, and the hot coffee finds its perfect match with the recipe’s chilled ingredients.






COFFEE AND HEALTH
HOW CAFFEINE WORKS
A cup of coffee contains about 50 mg of caffeine and its stimulant action, which lasts for one or two hours after it has been drunk, acts on the cerebrospinal nervous system.
