Today, agta record employs over 2,500 people around the world and ranks among the top companies in the global market for automatic doors. agta record is one of the very few groups that control the entire value chain encompassing the design, production, marketing, installation and maintenance of a large range of automatic door systems.

As a result, we will continue to grow this business at rates consistently higher than the market. Based on our extremely strong position in Europe we are developing fast in North America and in emerging markets such as China. We are working hard at intensifying the execution of this strategy. 

	Finally, we put a lot of emphasis on our reputation. We wish to be considered a serious and fair company, not only by our shareholders, but also by our stakeholders.

	Innovation

When our founder H.H. Bunzl began the production of automatic door systems in 1953, he was among the pioneers in the industry. The growing number of rival manufacturers was met by a strong will to innovate, which has always enabled our products to stand out from their competitors. Since the beginning, innovation has been a key driver and crucial factor in our steady growth.

	The agta record Company continuously works to modernize and optimize their door systems to provide their customers with advanced, innovative products. Sustainable, modern development is crucial for the success of the entire enterprise. For this reason, agta record operates a research and development department in Switzerland. Each year, a large part of the company's finances are invested in further developing its own products.

	record system 20

	2006 saw the introduction of the record system 20 and the most successful chapter in our history. As is still the case today, this was pioneering technology that set new standards at its various stages of development. Its core element, the CAN-bus networking system, significantly enhanced functional reliability and user-friendliness; with other door automation designs it has appeared on the market only slowly.

	THERMCORD PLUS

Building on the technical possibilities of the record system 20 were numerous ideas that developed into a product that combined the delicate appearance of the door system with energy-saving, heat-insulating properties. An important element of this project was the preparation for series production of thermally insulating door profiles, available in an ultra-slim design, in contrast to standard versions available on the market. This development was called the record THERMCORD, and first introduced in 2012. This model is already reducing air conditioning costs to an outstanding degree. The THERMCORD PLUS, which features active seals, is a further development of this application.

	The THERMCORD PLUS is the first door system from agta record to contain all the components of a fully sustainable product. Its outstanding energy saving properties make it exceptional. The main objective in its development was to provide customers with a door system that is affordable to purchase and maintain, and surpass all known standards. This product has completely updated the concept of the automatic door, on the one hand in the way its design has been developed, and on the other by its technical components. Elements of the THERMCORD series have been successively influenced by design planning in all other areas of our automatic door systems, and thus closely define our future strategic direction.

	Vision 2021

	The aim and goal of the agta record Group is to maintain operations on a holistic and sustainable basis up to 2021. To ensure this, all aspects of modern corporate management are being considered and implemented

moreMission statementOur group of companies designs, manufactures, markets, installs and maintains high quality products in Door, Gate and Building Automation (the control and monitoring of doors). We want to be the market leader in these areas! The wishes of the customers should be at the centre of our product development and all our services. We are open to new methods and new ideas. We strive to produce creative solutions, as only the continuous renewal of our range of products and services will guarantee the future success of the record group! We support market economy and profit-oriented principles. As a company that is quoted on the stock exchange, we look after the long-term interests of the shareholders and stakeholders*.
These goals can be achieved if our employees at all levels are highly qualified and motivated. The prerequisite for this is that technical and personal education and training is permanently promoted. The positive example of the managers is the basis of a good working environment and for the professional and personal development of our employees. We are convinced that thorough and fair business management in all respects and positive thinking have to be the chief principles of all our dealings.

moreThat is record!The first chapter of our company began in 1953 selling door drives, which were at that time a brand new product. Today, over 60 years later, our automatic door systems are in use worldwide, maintained by hundreds of service teams. Around 75'000 new record drives are sold every year in more than 50 countries.
Our Group of companies manufactures, sells, installs and maintains not only high-quality products in the field of doors and shutter doors, but also building automation systems (door control and monitoring). The Group develops all the components for drives, controllers and peripherals at their production sites in Switzerland, USA, Germany and France, providing the drive behind the steady growth of the last few decades.
Our subsidiaries in Europe, USA and Asia and our many years of experience in the field of mechanics, sensors, electronics and software for automatic door systems and peripherals make us a highly competent and reliable partner.
The customer is at the center of both the development of our products and their letated services. We are open to new ideas and methods.
The full satisfaction of our customers with the quality of our products and services is our most important goal and crucially important. We implement creative solutions, as only the constant renewal of the range of products and services can secure the success of the Group in the future.
The issue of maintenance and inspection enjoys a special status at record. Our products are designed for extreme longevity, so with the passing of time they may encounter changes to various statutory rules and provisions. In order to enhance customer convenience, our maintenance contracts are designed to provide personalized solutions that can be varied to suit the customer and provide the right kind of support to meet legal responsibilities in maintaining and caring for the installation.
