HKEx and Minsheng sign MOU
 
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) and the Hong Kong branch of China Minsheng Banking Corp, Ltd (Minsheng) today (Wednesday) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for strategic cooperation on solutions for market users and product development.
The MOU was signed by HKEx Chief Executive Charles Li and Hong Qi, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of Minsheng, one of the largest Mainland banks serving commodities companies.  The signing ceremony was held in Hong Kong and witnessed by Romnesh Lamba, HKEx's Co-head of Global Markets, Mao Zhirong, HKEx's Head of Mainland Development, Rebecca Brosnan, HKEx’s Head of Asia Commodities, Tae Yoo, HKEx's Head of Client Business Development & FIC Development, Lin Zhihong, President of Trade Finance SBU and Chief Executive Officer of Minsheng's Hong Kong branch, Huang Minghui, Senior Assistant Chief Executive Officer of Minsheng’s Hong Kong branch, and Chen Yi, Head of Commodity Finance, Structure Trade Finance Centre of Minsheng.    
Among other things, the MOU will help Minsheng in its delivery of hedging and other value chain solutions to its clients, and it will give HKEx access to Minsheng’s large client base for product marketing. 
"The MOU we signed today is a milestone for both parties and marks the beginning of HKEx's collaboration with Chinese banks in providing hedging and risk management tools for buyers and sellers of commodities throughout the value chain," said Mr Li.  "MOUs like this one are an ideal way for us to collaborate with a wide range of banks and organisations not yet part of our Exchange Participants community.
"We look forward to using our combined strengths, including our derivatives infrastructure and Minsheng's large network of offices and clients, for win-win initiatives that benefit the market as a whole as well as our organisations," Mr Li added.
Mr Hong said, "Commodities business is a key business of our bank in recent years.  Last year, we launched our exclusive brand in respect of bulk commodity financing business — "CFM" (Commodity Financing Manager).  Through diversified structure of financing and a wide range of transaction channels, we integrated commercial banking services with investment banking services to facilitate various activities such as raw material purchasing, acquisition of resources and product sales for corporate clients.  Today, we further develop our commodities business by cooperating with HKEx.  With the platform of HKEx, we believe that our bank can perfectly combine commodity management and the use of finance to provide clients with ideal financial solutions, which will in turn propel the cooperation and development of the financial sectors of Hong Kong and Mainland China."

AMID's Chinese Company Report (CCR) provides information on the Chinese large public-traded corporations, large manufacturing producers, large financial companies or large service providers. In the two past decades, the Chinese industry has been growing at a fast pace.   The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China’s society and economy. China is one of the world’s major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world’s fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.  The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. 
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector’s economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products. This new study focuses on the company's business overiew, organzation structure, products and services, production locations, recent activities, and financail data 
Asia Market Info & Dev Co. is one of the leading sources for up-to-date market information and research on the fastest-growing Chinese markets. We have published over 2,000 reports focusing on the Chinese markets,  industry forecasts and company profiles. We provide hard-to-find market data and analyses.
