Comprehensive Communication Suite Email Product: We offer a white-label, cross-device, web-based email product that includes everything your customers expect in an email experience and more.
Hosting & Delivery: Managing email can be difficult. We specialize in hosting and managing your email platform so you can focus on other areas of your business.
Powerful API: Our Synacor Communication API (SCAPI) provides access to all the features and capabilities of our messaging platform. Use our platform to integrate with your own internal systems like billing, customer care and self-serve portals.

Fully Featured. Our email product has a rich feature set that collects all the functionality your customers want in one place, from any device. Our service can also be extended with advanced features like voicemail, SMS, and social media integration.






Secure Hosting and Delivery. We offer hosting and management of millions of mailboxes that deliver billions of messages reliably and consistently. Our 1 million square foot, Tier 4 data center covers seven time zones around the world for secure infrastructure that safely stores data. We’re proud to say we’ve consistently exceeded our Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments.






Migration Experts. Worried about changing email hosts? Our in-house experts have years of experience migrating millions of mailboxes from every major email platform—including Google, Microsoft, Earthlink, Openwave, Oracle, Mirapoint and many others—so switching to our system is easy and hassle-free.






Seamless, Branded Experience. Your email product should feel like an extension of your company’s other digital properties, not something that’s tacked on to your other offerings. Unlike other email hosts, our white-label product is completely customizable to fit your brand’s look and feel, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.






Improve Your Bottom Line. Our platform offers optional advertising opportunities to increase your revenue without compromising the quality of your email experience—or your customers’ privacy. We also offer services and tools that can help reduce your email-related call center requests.






Industry Partnerships. We’ve built the leading solutions for email storage, security, spam protection, bounced emails and more right into our product. Our industry partnerships help us deliver a safe, reliable and enjoyable email experience for your customers.

	                                                “Market Capitalization” is a measure of the estimated value of the common equity securities of the company or their equivalent. It does not include securities convertible into the common equity securities. “Market Capitalization” is derived from the last sale price for the displayed class of listed securities and the total number of shares outstanding for both listed and unlisted securities (as applicable). NASDAQ does not use this value to determine compliance with the listing requirements.
