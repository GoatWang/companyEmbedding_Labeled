Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsNot for the squeamish!ByPJ Lea Bookishon 17 July 2016Format: Kindle EditionThis collection of short horror stories is repulsive, yet holds you enthralled. A vast array of themes, some that are outright horrific, others that are simply downright creepy. I'm unable to choose a favourite as they were all fascinating and gut-wrenching in their own way.As is usual with an anthology it has introduced me to many new authors and I would heartily recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach and a very open mind, definitely not for the squeamish!0Comment|

Some stories leave the fear factor to your imagination and don't spell it out. If you enjoy short stories and horror you will enjoy this but it's neither for young horror readers nor the faint hearted.0Comment|

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com Canada's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.

We pride ourselves on innovative products and an outstanding knowledge of the market alongside a nationwide delivery service to meet the most demanding of requirements.
There is little we don't know about compressed air equipment, and our after sales service is second to none including our service and repair of compressors, and all compressed air equipment. We aim to offer complete solutions to your requirements, offering ancillaries for all equipment sold as well as installation of full compressed air systems.

Our knowledge is backed up by the expertise of our suppliers. With our excellent buying relationships, we are able to secure competitive prices for brands such as Chicago Pneumatic, Universal Air Tools, Abac, Ingersoll Rand, Darda, Almig, Favre, Trelawny, PCL and many more. 

An additional string to our bow is our current relationship with 3M as their official Abrasive Systems Department Repair Centre. We provide warranty repairs, out of warranty repairs and a fully comprehensive spares supply service. Please see our service page for more information.  
Our growth has allowed us to build an impressive hire fleet stocking all of the items that we sell, for speedy delivery to suit the most urgent of requirements. Most items are readily available, with high stock levels of popular items such as rebar benders and cutters, concrete splitters, breakers, drills, air tools, pumps, compressors and surface preparation equipment.
We understand that our customers are working in demanding environments, where a long lead time is not always practical or acceptable. Our own fleet of vans ensure that we can get equipment to you on a next day or same day delivery basis to avoid the costs that downtime on site can incur.
Based close to Sheffield, we have a client base spanning industry sectors from civil and construction to mining, tunneling and offshore. You can rest assured that if the product required is not in stock, it will be in minimal time.
