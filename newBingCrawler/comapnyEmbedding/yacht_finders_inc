(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto.  Forward-Looking Statements  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. When used in this report, the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "intend", "plan" and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management's current view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many others: a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets; federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse effect on proposed transactions that we desire to effect; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in the securities of "penny stocks", and other risks and uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated, estimated or expected. The accompanying information contained in this registration statement, including, without limitation, the information set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation -- Risk Factors" identifies important additional factors that could materially adversely affect actual results and performance. You are urged to carefully consider these factors. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement.  Overview  We are a presently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) whose plan of operation over the next twelve months is to seek and, if possible, acquire an operating business or valuable assets by entering into a business combination. We will not be restricted in our search for business combination candidates to any particular geographical area, industry or industry segment, and may enter into a combination with a private business engaged in any line of business, including service, finance, mining, manufacturing, real estate, oil and gas, distribution, transportation, medical, communications, high technology, biotechnology or any other. Management's discretion is, as a practical matter, unlimited in the selection of a combination candidate. Management will seek combination candidates in the United States and other countries, as available time and resources permit, through existing associations and by word of mouth. This plan of operation has been adopted in order to attempt to create value for our shareholders. For further information on our plan of operation and business, see PART I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2015.  Plan of Operation  We do not intend to do any product research or development. We do not expect to buy or sell any real estate, plant or equipment except as such a purchase might occur by way of a business combination that is structured as an asset purchase, and no such asset purchase currently is anticipated. Similarly, we do not expect to add additional employees or any full-time employees except as a result of completing a business combination, and any such employees likely will be persons already then employed by the company acquired.  The Company's business plan consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. We anticipate no operations unless and until we complete a business combination as described above.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015  The following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 3-month period to the prior 3-month period:   9/30/2016 9/30/2015 Percentage Line Item (unaudited) (unaudited) (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues - - - - Operating expenses 3,732 4,652 (920 ) (6.3 %) Net loss (21,282 ) (21,319 ) 37 (0.2 %) Loss per share of common stock $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 ) 0.00 0.0 %  We recorded a net loss of $21,282 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $21,319 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015  The following table summarizes the results of our operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 9-month period to the prior 9-month period:   9/30/2016 9/30/2015 Percentage Line Item (unaudited) (unaudited) Increase) Increase Revenues - - - - Operating expenses 45,881 45,686 195 0.4 % Net loss (67,652 ) (64,830 ) (2,822 ) 4.4 % Loss per share of common stock $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) 0.00 0.0 %  We recorded a net loss of $67,652 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $64,830 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We had $0 cash on hand at September 30, 2016 and had no other assets to meet ongoing expenses or debts that may accumulate. Since inception, we have accumulated a deficit of $702,669. As of September 30, 2016 we had total liabilities and a negative working capital of $652,869.  We have no commitment for any capital expenditure and foresee none. However, we will incur routine fees and expenses incident to our reporting duties as a public company, and we will incur expenses in finding and investigating possible acquisitions and other fees and expenses in the event we make an acquisition or attempt but are unable to complete an acquisition. Our cash requirements for the next twelve months are principally for accounting expenses and other expenses related to making filings required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which should not exceed $50,000 in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Any travel, lodging or other expenses which may arise related to finding, investigating and attempting to complete a combination with one or more potential acquisitions could also amount to thousands of dollars.  We will only be able to pay our future obligations and meet operating expenses by raising additional funds, acquiring a profitable company or otherwise generating positive cash flow. As a practical matter, we are unlikely to generate positive cash flow by any means other than acquiring a company with such cash flow. We believe that management members or shareholders will loan funds to us as needed for operations prior to completion of an acquisition. Management and the shareholders are not obligated to provide funds to us, however, and it is not certain they will always want or be financially able to do so. Our shareholders and management members who advance money to us to cover operating expenses will expect to be reimbursed, either by us or by the company acquired, prior to or at the time of completing a combination. We have no intention of borrowing money to reimburse or pay salaries to any of our officers, directors or shareholders or their affiliates. There currently are no plans to sell additional securities to raise capital, although sales of securities may be necessary to obtain needed funds. Our current management has agreed to continue their services to us and to accrue sums owed them for services and expenses and expect payment reimbursement only.  Should existing management or shareholders refuse to advance needed funds, however, we would be forced to turn to outside parties to either loan money to us or buy our securities. There is no assurance whatever that we will be able at need to raise necessary funds from outside sources. Such a lack of funds could result in severe consequences to us, including among others:  ? failure to make timely filings with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act, which also probably would result in suspension of trading or quotation in our stock and could result in fines and penalties to us under the Exchange Act;  ? curtailing or eliminating our ability to locate and perform suitable investigations of potential acquisitions; or  ? inability to complete a desirable acquisition due to lack of funds to pay legal and accounting fees and acquisition-related expenses.  We hope to require potential candidate companies to deposit funds with us that we can use to defray professional fees and travel, lodging and other due diligence expenses incurred by our management related to finding and investigating a candidate company and negotiating and consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that any potential candidate will agree to make such a deposit.  Going Concern  Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit issued in connection with the financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015, relative to our ability to continue as a going concern. We had $652,869 negative working capital as of September 30, 2016; we had an accumulated deficit of $702,669 incurred through September 30, 2016 and recorded a loss of $21,282 for the third quarter of 2016 and a loss of $84,863 from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.T he going concern opinion issued by our auditors means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for 12-month period ending December 31, 2016 and thereafter. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

(1)
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

Yacht
Finders, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in
Delaware on November 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation
to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. The Company did not
conduct any operations until April 15, 2003, the date the Company
filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht Finders,
Inc. Yacht Finder’s Inc. business plan was to create an
online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface
immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of
targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company
discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. The
Company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential
targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets,
share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of
transaction.

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for annual financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation,
have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
For further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

USE OF
ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

 

The
Company reports loss per share using a dual presentation of basic
and diluted loss per share. Basic loss per share excludes the
impact of common stock equivalents and is determined by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised
or converted into common stock. At September 30, 2016, there were
no variances between the basic and diluted loss per share as there
were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding.

 

GOING
CONCERN

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated
a net loss of $21,282 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2016 and has a stockholders’ deficit of $652,869 as of
September 30, 2016. These conditions, among others, raises
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going
concern is dependent on working capital advances being provided by
the Company’s majority shareholder for its ability to meet
its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required
and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. There is no assurance that the working capital
advances will continue in the future nor that Company will be
successful in raising additional funds through other
sources.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CON’T)

 

NEW
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

From time
to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that
may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting.
The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the
effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its
accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to
its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when
implemented.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had loans and notes outstanding
from a shareholder in the aggregate amount of $510,412, which bears
interest at 6% per annum and represents amounts loaned to the

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements and
information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our
management as well as assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, our management. When used in this report,
the words “believe,” “anticipate,”
“expect,” “estimate,” “intend”,
“plan” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or
our management, are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements reflect management’s current
view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many others:
a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets;
federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse effect on
proposed transactions that we desire to effect; Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in the
securities of “penny stocks”, and other risks and
uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary materially from those described in this
report as anticipated, estimated or expected. The accompanying
information contained in this registration statement, including,
without limitation, the information set forth under the heading
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of
Operation -- Risk Factors” identifies important additional
factors that could materially adversely affect actual results and
performance. You are urged to carefully consider these factors. All
forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary
statement.

 

Overview

 

We are a
presently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act) whose plan of operation over the next twelve months is to seek
and, if possible, acquire an operating business or valuable assets
by entering into a business combination. We will not be restricted
in our search for business combination candidates to any particular
geographical area, industry or industry segment, and may enter into
a combination with a private business engaged in any line of
business, including service, finance, mining, manufacturing, real
estate, oil and gas, distribution, transportation, medical,
communications, high technology, biotechnology or any other.
Management’s discretion is, as a practical matter, unlimited
in the selection of a combination candidate. Management will seek
combination candidates in the United States and other countries, as
available time and resources permit, through existing associations
and by word of mouth. This plan of operation has been adopted in
order to attempt to create value for our shareholders. For further
information on our plan of operation and business, see PART I, Item
1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
2015.

 

Plan of
Operation

 

We do not
intend to do any product research or development. We do not expect
to buy or sell any real estate, plant or equipment except as such a
purchase might occur by way of a business combination that is
structured as an asset purchase, and no such asset purchase
currently is anticipated. Similarly, we do not expect to add
additional employees or any full-time employees except as a result
of completing a business combination, and any such employees likely
will be persons already then employed by the company
acquired.

 

The
Company’s business plan consists of exploring potential
targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets,
share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction.
We anticipate no operations unless and until we complete a business
combination as described above.

	Background




	 




	Yacht
	Finders, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
	20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. On April 15,
	2003 the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder’s Inc. business
	plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while
	capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company discontinued its prior business and
	changed its business plan. The Company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business
	combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction




	 




	The
	Company’s current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more properties or businesses,
	and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be
	made by purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation,
	joint venture, or partnership. The Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage
	of more than one such business opportunity. The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term
	growth as opposed to short-term earnings.




	 




	The
	Company’s principal shareholders are in contact with broker-dealers and other persons with whom they are acquainted who
	are involved in corporate finance matters to advise them of the Company’s existence and to determine if any companies or
	businesses they represent have an interest in considering a merger or acquisition with the Company. No assurance can be given
	that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are available
	for acquisitions, or that any acquisition that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders.

	The
	Company’s search is directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises which have a desire to become public corporations
	and which are able to satisfy, or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy, the minimum asset and other
	requirements in order to qualify shares for trading on one of the NASDAQ Markets or a stock exchange (See “Investigation
	and Selection of Business Opportunities”). The Company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it may (i)
	be recently organized with no operating history, or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors;
	(ii) be experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to
	expand into a new market; (iv) be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept; or (v) have a combination of the characteristics
	mentioned in (i) through (iv). The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it
	believes to be undervalued. Given the above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have a history
	of losses or low profitability.




	 




	The
	Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry,
	and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources. This includes industries such
	as service, finance, natural resources, manufacturing, high technology, product development, medical, communications and others.
	The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such
	opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.




	 




	Any
	entity which has an interest in being acquired by, or merging into the Company, is expected to be an entity that desires to become
	a public company and establish a public trading market for its securities. In connection with such a merger or acquisition, it
	is highly likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the Company would be issued by the Company or purchased from
	the current principal shareholders of the Company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates. If stock is purchased from the current
	shareholders, the transaction is very likely to result in substantial gains to them relative to their purchase price for such
	stock. In the Company’s judgment, none of its officers and directors would thereby become an “underwriter” within
	the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The sale of a controlling interest by certain principal
	shareholders of the Company could occur at a time when the other shareholders of the Company remain subject to restrictions on
	the transfer of their shares.




	 




	It
	is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including its principal
	shareholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members
	of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no plans, understandings, agreements,
	or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company.




	 




	The
	Company does not foresee that it would enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which its officers,
	directors or principal shareholders are currently affiliated. Should the Company determine in the future, contrary to foregoing
	expectations, that a transaction with an affiliate would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company
	is, in general, permitted by Delaware law to enter into such a transaction if:




	 




	1.
	The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or
	are known to the Board of Directors, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote
	of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or




	 




	2.
	The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or
	are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith
	by vote of the stockholders; or




	 




	3.
	The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors
	or the stockholders.

	Investigation
	and Selection of Business Opportunities





	 




	To
	a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon the principal shareholders’
	analysis of the quality of the other company’s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or
	marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, the perceived benefit the Company will derive from becoming a publicly
	held entity, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective
	criteria. In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily
	be indicative of the potential for the future because of the possible need to access capital, shift marketing approaches substantially,
	expand significantly, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. The Company
	will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement, or
	be primarily responsible for the implementation of, required changes. Because the Company may participate in a business opportunity
	with a newly organized firm or with a firm which is entering a new phase of growth, it should be emphasized that the Company will
	incur further risks, because management in many instances will not have proved its abilities or effectiveness, the eventual market
	for such company’s products or services will likely not be established, and such company may not be profitable when acquired.




	 




	It
	is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to one such venture because of
	the Company’s limited financial resources. This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential
	losses from one business opportunity against profits from another, and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision
	to purchase the Company’s securities.




	 




	It
	is emphasized that the Company may affect transactions having a potentially adverse impact upon the Company’s shareholders
	pursuant to the authority and discretion of the Company’s management and board of directors to complete acquisitions without
	submitting any proposal to the stockholders for their consideration. Holders of the Company’s securities should not anticipate
	that the Company will necessarily furnish such holders, prior to any merger or acquisition, with financial statements, or any
	other documentation, concerning a target company or its business. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a
	business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by such directors to seek
	the stockholders’ advice and consent or because state law so requires.




	 




	The
	analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s principal shareholders,
	who are not professional business analysts. Although there are no current plans to do so, the Company might hire outside consultants
	to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finder’s fee. Since the Company
	has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities,
	no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants
	or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service, or regarding the total amount of fees that may be paid. However,
	because of the limited resources of the Company, it is likely that any such fees the Company agrees to pay would be paid in stock
	and not in cash. Otherwise, the Company anticipates that it will consider, among other things, the following factors:




	 




	1.
	Potential for growth and profitability, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products;




	 




	2.
	The Company’s perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by
	the Company’s stockholders;




	 




	3.
	Whether, following the business combination, the financial condition of the business opportunity would be, or would have a significant
	prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable the securities of the Company to qualify for listing on an
	exchange or on a national automated securities quotation system, such as NASDAQ, so as to permit the trading of such securities
	to be exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c2-6 adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	 




	4.
	Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through
	the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other sources;




	 




	5.
	The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;




	 







	 



	5



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 




	6.
	Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within
	the industry as a whole;




	 




	7.
	Strength and diversity of existing management, or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment;




	 




	8.
	The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potential; and




	 




	9.
	The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required
	items.




	 




	In
	regard to the possibility that the shares of the Company would qualify for listing on one of the NASDAQ Markets, the current standards
	include the requirements that the issuer of the securities satisfy, among other requirements, certain minimum levels of shareholder
	equity, market value or net income. Many of the business opportunities that might be potential candidates for a combination with
	the Company would not satisfy any of the NASDAQ Market listing criteria.




	 




	Not
	one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity, and the Company will attempt
	to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and
	available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development,
	all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
	Potential investors must recognize that, because of the Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the Company
	may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.




	 




	The
	Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. Prior to making a decision to participate in a
	business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity
	containing such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available
	projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence
	of existing patents, trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management;
	a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and required
	facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements;
	audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurances
	that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time following completion of a merger
	transaction; and other information deemed relevant.




	 




	As
	part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s principal shareholders may meet personally with management and
	key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided,
	check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s
	limited financial resources.




	 




	It
	is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited
	by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of “penny stocks.” The
	regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company’s securities until such time
	as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the “penny
	stock” regulations.

	The
	Company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company
	to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance
	liquidity for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale
	of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition
	candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility
	of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates who have
	a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive
	alternative.




	 




	There
	are no loan arrangements or arrangements for any financing whatsoever relating to any business opportunities currently available.




	 





	Form
	of Acquisition





	 




	It
	is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities
	will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the
	basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed
	by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements,
	licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in
	a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or
	reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no
	assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders
	of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization
	transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing management and directors may resign and new management
	and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.




	 




	It
	is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other
	securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain
	circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization
	under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling
	interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction
	were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Internal
	Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding
	shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior
	to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares
	representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders.




	 




	It
	is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available,
	from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element
	of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under
	certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale
	into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.




	 




	The
	Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the
	terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties
	by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be
	satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not
	closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type.

	As
	a general matter, the Company anticipates that it, and/or its officers and principal shareholders will enter into a letter of
	intent with the management, principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement. Such
	letter of intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will generally not bind any of the parties to consummate
	the transaction. Execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable. Neither
	the Company nor any of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until
	a definitive agreement concerning the acquisition as described in the preceding paragraph is executed. Even after a definitive
	agreement is executed, it is possible that the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right
	provided in the agreement to terminate it on specified grounds.




	 




	It
	is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant
	agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If
	a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation
	might not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after
	the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible
	to procure such goods and services.




	 




	In
	all probability, upon completion of an acquisition or merger, there will be a change in control through issuance of substantially
	more shares of common stock. Further, in conjunction with an acquisition or merger, it is likely that the principal shareholders
	may offer to sell a controlling interest at a price not relative to or reflective of a price which could be achieved by individual
	shareholders at the time.




	 





	Investment
	Company Act and Other Regulation





	 




	The
	Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business. The Company
	does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities
	so as to avoid being classified as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment
	Act”), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment
	Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.




	 




	Section
	3(a) of the Investment Act contains the definition of an “investment company,” and it excludes any entity that does
	not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or that does not engage in the business
	of investing, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” (defined as “all securities other than government
	securities or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries”) the value of which exceeds 40% of the value of its total assets
	(excluding government securities, cash or cash items). The Company intends to implement its business plan in a manner which will
	result in the availability of this exception from the definition of “investment company.” Consequently, the Company’s
	participation in a business or opportunity through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited.




	 




	The
	Company’s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if
	it consummates a reorganization as discussed above. Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect
	purchasers of investment company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment company, stockholders will not
	be afforded these protections.




	 




	Any
	securities which the Company might acquire in exchange for its Common Stock are expected to be “restricted securities”
	within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). If the Company elects to resell such securities,
	such sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission
	or an exemption from registration is available. Section 4(1) of the Act, which exempts sales of securities not involving a distribution,
	would in all likelihood be available to permit a private sale. Although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities
	acquired, if such a sale were to be necessary, the Company would be required to comply with the provisions of the Act to affect
	such resale.




	 




	An
	acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance
	with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.

	companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience,
	resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access
	to attractive business opportunities.

	Finders, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
	20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. On April 15,
	2003 the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder’s Inc. business
	plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while
	capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company discontinued its prior business and
	changed its business plan. The Company’s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business
	combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction.

	year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to an increase in interest expense of $3,510. The increase in interest expense resulted

	$724,224. Our operating activities used $55,011 in cash for the fiscal year period ended December 31, 2016, while our operations
	used $55,912 cash in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. We earned no revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016
	or 2015.




	 




	Management
	believes that the Company will require a cash infusion of at least $50,000 for the next twelve months. Historically, we have depended
	on loans from our principal shareholders and their affiliated companies (to provide us with working capital as required. There
	is no guarantee that such funding will be available when required and there can be no assurance that our stockholders, or any
	of them, will continue making loans or advances to us in the future.




	 




	At
	December 31, 2016, the Company had loans and notes outstanding from a shareholder in the aggregate amount of $522,835 plus accrued
	interest, which represents amounts loaned to the Company to pay the Company’s expenses of operation. On December 31, 2016,
	the Payee under the Note and the Company agreed that the Due Date of the Note would be extended to December 31, 2017.

	The

	Critical Accounting Policies” suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical
	accounting policies. In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical
	accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and operating
	results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates
	of matters that are inherently uncertain. The nature of our business generally does not call for the preparation or use of estimates.
	Due to the fact that the Company does not have any operating business, we do not believe that we do not have any such critical
	accounting policies.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Yacht Finders, Inc.




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Yacht Finders, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements
	of income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. Yacht Finder’s management is responsible
	for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yacht
	Finders, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then
	ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
	in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has not generated any revenue and has accumulated losses of $724,224 since
	inception. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $674,424. These factors, among others, raise
	substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to
	these matters are also described in Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 




	Yacht
	Finders, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
	20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. On April 15, 2003
	the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder’s Inc. business plan was
	to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while capturing the
	benefits of targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company discontinued its business plan. The Company’s business
	plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase or
	exchange, merger or similar type of transaction.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 




	Basis
	of Presentation




	 




	The
	Company’s financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United
	States. Effective December 31, 2014, the Company elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage
	Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to
	remove the inception to date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of topic 915.




	 




	USE
	OF ESTIMATES




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.




	 




	REVENUE
	RECOGNITION




	 




	The
	Company has not recognized any revenues from its operations.




	 




	CASH
	AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.




	 




	LOSS
	PER COMMON SHARE




	 




	The
	Company reports loss per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per share. Basic loss per share excludes the
	impact of common stock equivalents and is determined by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
	if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. At December 31, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015, there were no variances between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potentially dilutive
	securities outstanding.




	 




	INCOME
	TAXES




	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC-740
	“Accounting for Income Taxes”. ASC-740 requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
	expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
	method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
	bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
	reverse.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CON’T)





	 




	In
	addition ASC-740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement
	related to accounting for income taxes and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it
	is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The Company has identified its federal
	tax return and its state tax return in California as “major” tax jurisdictions, as defined. The Company believes that
	its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result
	in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves
	for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC-740.




	 




	FAIR
	VALUE MEASUREMENTS




	 




	The
	Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value
	as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair
	value measurements.




	 




	The
	estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including, payables to related parties, and accrued liabilities are carried
	at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.




	 




	ASC
	820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
	in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
	on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
	inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
	be used to measure fair value:




	 






	Level
	1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities






	 






	Level
	2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable






	 






	Level
	3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)






	 




	NEW
	ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	 




	From
	time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
	that may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
	pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting
	or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.

	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10: Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
	Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , to improve financial
	reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities.
	The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities,
	thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments
	in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining
	whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments
	to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve
	the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance
	by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and
	disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related
	to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied
	retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. The Company has elected early
	adoption of this ASU.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-15,

	Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern

	(Subtopic 205-40), (ASU No. 2014-15), which requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going
	concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, ASU
	2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date
	that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt
	is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures
	when substantial doubt is not alleviated. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted.

	GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
	not generated any revenue and has accumulated losses of $724,224 since inception. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working
	capital deficit of $674,424. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to
	obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company intends to seek additional working
	capital advances from the Company’s majority shareholder and other sources. There is no assurance that the
	working capital advances will continue in the future nor that Company will be successful in raising additional funds through other
	sources.

	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $253,310 of federal and state net operating loss carryovers (“NOLs”)
	which begin to expire in 2035. Utilization of the NOLs may be subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382
	should there be a greater than 50% ownership change as determined under regulations.




	 




	In
	assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
	all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
	of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
	reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based
	on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
	for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

	The
	Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as
	defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
	Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
	within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without
	limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
	that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its
	principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
	as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	In
	accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
	as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s sole officer concluded
	that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information
	required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized,
	and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.




	 






	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
	over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
	process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and
	effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:




	 






	●




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
	the assets of the company;






	 




	 






	●




	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and






	 




	 






	●




	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 




	Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
	any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
	in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
	no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
	reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
	internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
	over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
	it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

	As
	of December 31, 2016 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
	for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
	Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures
	were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies
	that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal
	controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.




	 




	The
	matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight
	in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
	with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned
	material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the year ended
	December 31, 2016.




	 




	Management
	believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
	management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
	of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
	which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.




	 




	This
	annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
	to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management’s report in this annual report.




	 






	Management’s
	Remediation Initiatives






	 




	Given
	the financial resources available to the Company, the Company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the
	identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls. As such time as the Company commences
	operations and has the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses, we intend to create take action
	to do so. Unfortunately, until the Company has such financial resources, the identified weaknesses will continue to exist.






	 








	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	.

	During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2016, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered
	by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting.




	 






	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls



	.

	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
	reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in
	all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company
	have been detected.

	since November 2001. Mr. Colligan holds a Masters Degree in Social Work and specializes
	in the delivery of quality behavioral healthcare to individuals and groups. Prior to
	joining Adventist, Mr. Colligan’s work focused on the investigation and analysis
	of clinical data relating to behavioral health through his work as a Clinical Research

	have the capital resources to pay director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and
	who would be willing to act as an audit committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board
	of directors we expect that we will seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining
	any such expert our board would make a determination as to whether such person is independent.

	the Code of Ethics. If we retain additional officers in the future to act as our principal financial officer, principal accounting
	officer, controller or persons serving similar functions, they would become subject to the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics
	does not indicate the consequences of a breach of the code. If there is a breach, the board of directors would review the facts
	and circumstances surrounding the breach and take action that it deems appropriate, which action may include dismissal of the
	employee who breached the code. Currently, since Mr. Colligan serves as the sole director and sole officer, he is responsible
	for reviewing his own conduct under the Code of Ethics and determining what action to take in the event of his own breach of the
	Code of Ethics.

	At
	December 31, 2016, the Company had loans and notes outstanding from Fountainhead Capital Management Limited (“FHM”)
	(a related party) in the aggregate amount of $522,836, plus accrued interest of approximately $141,409, which represents amounts
	loaned to the Company to pay the Company’s expenses of operation. On December 31, 2016, the Payee under the Note and the
	Company agreed that the Due Date of the Note would be extended to December 31, 2017.




	 




	Effective
	as of October 1, 2007, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with FHM. The term of the Services Agreement is one year
	and the Company is obligated to pay FHM a quarterly fee in the amount of $10,000, in cash or in kind, on the first day of each
	calendar quarter commencing September 30, 2007. A copy of the Services Agreement was attached to the Company’s Form 10-Q
	for the period ended April 30, 2008 filed on June 9, 2008 as Exhibit 10.1 thereto. The term of the Services Agreement has been
	extended to December 31, 2017.

	During

	Our board, acting as an audit committee, deemed the fees charged to be compatible with maintenance of the independence of our

	THE
	BOARD OF DIRECTORS PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES




	 




	We
	do not have a separate audit committee. Our full board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee. Before an independent
	auditor is engaged by us to render audit or non-audit services, our board of directors pre-approves the engagement. Board of directors
	pre-approval of audit and non-audit services will not be required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant
	to pre-approval policies and procedures established by our board of directors regarding our engagement of the independent auditor,
	provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, our board of directors is informed of each service
	provided, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of our board of directors’ responsibilities under the
	Exchange Act to our management. Our board of directors may delegate to one or more designated members of our board of directors
	the authority to grant pre-approvals, provided such approvals are presented to the board of directors at a subsequent meeting.
	If our board of directors elects to establish pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the board of
	directors must be informed of each non-audit service provided by the independent auditor. Board of directors pre-approval of non-audit
	services, other than review and attest services, also will not be required if such services fall within available exceptions established
	by the SEC. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, 100% of audit-related services, tax services and other services performed
	by our independent auditors were pre-approved by our board of directors.




	 




	Our
	board has considered whether the services described above under the caption “All Other Fees”, which are currently
	none, is compatible with maintaining the auditor’s independence.




	 




	The
	board approved all fees described above.
