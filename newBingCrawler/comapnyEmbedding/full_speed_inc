EVE– Embedded Video Engine
        
EVE technology is a revolutionary concept that utilizes an object oriented methodology for creating hi-quality 
		human machine interfaces (HMIs).  With support for display, audio, and touch,  this new technology allows engineers to quickly and efficiently design 
		HMIs and deliver robust solutions, hi-resolution displays with lower bill of material costs. The 
		EVE product offering includes:

FT800 –  Generation 1 with 512 x 512 pixel resolution and resistive touch 
FT801 –  Generation 1 with 512 x 512 pixel resolution and capacitive touch 
FT810 – Generation 2 with 800 x 600 pixel resolution and resistive touch
FT811 – Generation 2 with 800 x 600 pixel resolution and capacitive touch
FT812 – Generation 2 with 800 x 600 pixel resolution, resistive touch and true 24 bit colour 
FT813 – Generation 2 with 800 x 600 pixel resolution, capacitive touch and true 24 bit colour 

FT-X
        
FT-X series devices offer lower power, lower pin count, and  a leadership feature set, that makes bridging from a USB ports to UART, I2C, enhanced SPI (FT1248) or FIFO interfaces  easy to design and implement.
