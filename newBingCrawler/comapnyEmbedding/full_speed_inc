The PICDEM™ FS-USB is a demonstration and evaluation board for the PIC18F4550 family of Flash microcontrollers with full speed USB 2.0 interface.
The board contains a PIC18F4550 microcontroller in a 44-pin TQFP package, representing the superset of the entire family of devices offering the following features:


    48 MHz maximum operating speed (12 MIPS)
    32 Kbytes of Enhanced Flash memory
    2 Kbytes of RAM (of which 1 Kbyte dual port)
    256 bytes of data EEPROM
    Full Speed USB 2.0 interface (capable of 12 Mbit/s data tranfers), including FS-USB transceiver and voltage regulator

The board comes pre-loaded with a USB bootloader that demonstrates the Enhanced Flash memory capabilities of the device. The PIC18F4550 can be re-programmed in circuit without an external programmer.

A CD-ROM is also included in the kit which contains full documentation about the board, application notes and software libraries for support of the HID, CDC and custom classes.
