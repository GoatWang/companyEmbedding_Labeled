Message from the President


Kawanishi Warehouse has expanded its normal and cold storage warehouse operations in the major trade ports in Japan as a long established store of logistics since its establishment in 1918. We provide consistent comprehensive total distribution services, connecting consumption to production efficiently from port transport to storage, customs clearance, distribution processing and transportation and delivery.

Our management philosophy of expanding and extension of profits is of the utmost importance.  Our focus in doing so stabilizes corporate management base and every effort is taken to strengthen and achieve this goal.




Our basic policy accounts for the following four points:



1.
We offer higher distribution quality to our customers by suggesting efficiency of operation.


2.
Our strength is in raising profit and expanding management base.  We are positioned for rapid progress leading into our upcoming 100th year anniversary in 2018.


3.
We rebuild overseas base in the ASEAN district in conjunction with the globalization of each customers business.


4.
We are environmentally conscious and consider the global environment aiming for companies to achieve CSR.



Our basic strategy and aim is for the reinforcement of distribution quality and management base, expansion of distribution center business and global physical distribution service.


We thank you for your continued support.
