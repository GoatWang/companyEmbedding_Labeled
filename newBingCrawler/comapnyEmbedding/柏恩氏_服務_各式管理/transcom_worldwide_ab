Transcom Spain awarded at the Platinum Contact Center Awards 2017


Transcom has once again been recognized with this important prize awarded by the Contact Center Magazine in one of the most prestigious customer care galas in Spain: the Platinum Contact Center Awards.
In this year’s event, which was held at the Goya Theater in Madrid, Transcom was awarded in the “Best Customer Experience in Banking” category for the high-quality services provided to one of its main clients.

The awards ceremony was attended by more than 300 contact center industry executives from various sectors, and the participating Contact Center and Technology companies.
These awards recognize the excellence and know-how of companies that each year demonstrate their firm quality commitment and their efforts to develop the relationship with their customers. Companies in the sector are awarded for their high degree of professionalism and competitive services, adapted to the needs of each client.
Juan Brun, Country Manager of Transcom Iberia, said: “It is an honor having received this award once again, which reinforces our leadership position in such a demanding industry as banking. To keep the level of quality and high standards year after year is a challenging task and this award recognizes the great work done by our teams each day”.

The Great Transcom Bake Off


The Dutch Transcom team has shown exceptional creativity in the first Great Transcom Bake Off. The contest took place in early April and served as a fund raiser for the local Animal Ambulance. 12 Transcom team members put their baking skills to test, the results of which were professionally tasted by the jury, including local General Manager Joop Evers.
The cakes were rated on taste, texture, presentation and creativity. The cakes, a wide variety of flavors and types ranging from Oreo to double layer fondant, were put up for sale to raise money for the local Animal Ambulance. The jury was all praises for the bakers’ creativity and applauded them for their commitment to supporting the volunteers at the Animal Ambulance.
Eva de Vries was declared the proud winner of the contest, an 8/10 as per the jury. She brought the perfect balance between taste, creativity and presentation – a beautiful cake that tasted just as delicious. Yvonne Splinter and Ginette Loer came in second and third. Brilliant job by all of you!
Transcom Netherlands gladly doubled the amount that Transcom’s Next Top Bakers raised and is happy to support the local Animal Ambulance, a voluntary organization that collects sick and wounded animals and brings them to an animal shelter where their owners can pick them up once they recover. The volunteers work selflessly and are 24/7 available for emergencies, a tremendously devoted group of people. (www.dierenambulance-groningen.nl).

Transcom’s industry-tailored CX expertise


The world of customer care is currently going through a period of radical transformation. And, like in many other areas, the drivers of change are digitalization and the ever-present ambition to always offer the best possible Customer Experience. It should however be pointed out that these developments are not affecting all product categories in exactly the same way. As a result, we have to take the distinctive features of each industrial sector into consideration when defining a successful customer care strategy. But this is by no means a new need. A specialized approach has always been necessary, but perhaps customer care now has to demonstrate that it is more dynamic and flexible, because consumers are becoming increasingly demanding and the service they receive from businesses represents a key differentiating factor, now more than ever.
Many characteristics need to be identified and calibrated for each individual sector in order to define optimum customer care processes: which services to automate and which to continue to assign to “human” operators; what mix of contact channels to provide; how and when to engage in cross-selling and retention activities during the customer’s lifecycle; what requirements to adopt in terms of service levels; without forgetting the various profiles and training needs for agents, in order to deliver the best possible customer experience. Over the years, Transcom has gained significant experience in multiple industry sectors and knows how to devise and fine-tune the most effective mix of services to support its clients as they tackle the challenges in the global marketplace.
We know, for example, that in eCommerce it is essential to offer solid, reliable customer care services to manage payments and logistics-related issues. These services must also be provided over non-voice channels, like private messaging, which is becoming increasingly important when compared to traditional channels.
In the Banking sector, which is typically less aggressive in its use of contact centers for sales, we work with our clients to transform inbound customer care services into contact opportunities to promote cross-selling and upselling.
We know how to provide exceptional first-level technical support to the manufacturers of Electronic Goods and Household Appliances and we help them reduce their warranty costs. Likewise, for our clients in the Telecommunications sector, we have equipped ourselves with mobile phone emulators so that we can provide assistance for hundreds of different devices.

These are just a few examples of how Transcom supports its partners with industry-tailored solutions. Here at Transcom, we have always regarded this industry-specific approach as a fundamental and central part of a strategy that basically leverages two main factors:

Sharing the best practices we offer our clients worldwide, through our global “One Transcom” platform;
The organisation of our areas of expertise into Industry Practice Groups, with the main aim of developing a range of specific services for each sector that responds to the challenges faced by our clients.

These global initiatives, combined with the support and guidance of our clients, allow us to continue to be the Partner of Choice to manage customer care in diverse industry sectors.

Transcom’s value proposition


At Transcom, we take pride in our ability to deliver outstanding customer experience. Our work to continuously develop and refine our Value Proposition builds on three major elements that best describe our organizational capabilities:
1. Customer Experience Management
2. Digitalization & Multi-Channel
3. World Class Contact Center
Our Customer Experience Management efforts are heavily focused on our ability to make our partners’ and our partners’ customers’ journeys not only enjoyable but, more importantly, effortless. Within this area, Transcom delivers a number of services that are geared towards the fulfillment and delivery of an outstanding experience. All aspects of our offering are related to our ability to answer the questions: “How can we assist you at key customer touch points? And how can we make your journey to resolution as effortless as possible?”
In the Digitalization and Multi-Channel area, we offer our clients insights and recommendations on how to transform and adapt their customer care operations to the rapid growth in digital customer interactions. Together with our clients, we devise multi-channel solutions that support a seamless customer journey. We continue to increase our delivery of services via digital channels, with non-voice interactions accounting for approximately 30% of revenue in 2016.
Within the World Class Contact Center element, our work is focused on moving Transcom to the next level of service, evolving from being an outsourcing partner to becoming a true transformation partner. Our industry is changing rapidly, with live contacts becoming more and more complex. The ability to add value and offer customers proactive advice will increase in importance, and many companies will put more emphasis on upselling and cross-selling. This is putting pressure on current business models, e.g. in terms of recruitment, staff engagement, and price models. A World Class Contact Center needs to create an environment that brings together solutions, process changes and technology with people. This is why many of our initiatives in this area are  focused on people engagement, process maturity, and technology.

We truly believe that these three pillars all work together in adding value to our service offerings, in further enhancing our ability to deliver outstanding performance, and in building stronger relationships with our partners.

Adventure of a lifetime: exchanged Minsk for Vilnius


The first thing that wowed Karyna about Vilnius  when she first arrived from Minsk was its narrow streets, which looked like they were the guardians of hundred-year-old secrets, and the general atmosphere shrouding the entire city. She liked the university where she had decided to study law from the very first day too. Naturally, the fact that her native city of Minsk was just a few hours away by train also helped her to make this decision. Today, Karyna is happy that she decided to settle in a foreign country and tells us how she went about starting her life here, what is surprising about Lithuanians and what Belarus could learn from its neighbour.
Photo from Karyna’s personal archive
A piece of her homeland in Lithuania
Karyna’s decision to study in Lithuania was determined by the fact that the European Humanities University of Belarus was in Vilnius – the same university that was previously located in Minsk. However, due to restrictions of its academic freedom, the university decided to relocate to Lithuania.
“I left Minsk when I was only seventeen. Although I wanted to study abroad, I did not want to go very far away, so, Vilnius was the perfect choice. I liked the idea that I would be able to live in one of the oldest European cities and would have the opportunity to familiarise myself with the common history of Lithuania and Belarus. After all, some time ago we were one country”, says Karyna.
Foreign language – key to finding a job
When she was still in school, Karyna tried several jobs: she sewed toys, worked as a waitress and even worked as a courier. Karyna, who started her Master’s studies this year, was finally able to start looking for a job in Lithuania, seeing that at long last she has some free time. However, the search was not easy.
“I was searching for a job with a lot of conditions of my own. Firstly, I do not speak Lithuanian. Secondly, I am a student and cannot work full-time. Foreigners often get jobs in positions where a foreign language other than English is needed. Those coming from other countries can look for jobs where their native language is required, but this didn’t apply to me. In the Lithuanian labour market, there is no shortage of Belarussian or Russian-speakers. I was saved by my knowledge of German”, she says.
She speaks German and has spent a year in Germany, where she learnt about the culture of the country. According to Karyna, it was the language and experience abroad, which particularly helped her to stand out from other candidates. She is now working for an international company, Transcom Worldwide Vilnius, which provides contact centre services. Karyna says that she has found her favourite job and the staff are like her family.
“I did not want to neglect my studies and I was fortunate to land a job where I could have a flexible schedule. Furthermore, the company’s internal culture and attitude to employees are a great incentive for students. For example, it is always possible to have a day off for examinations or other study-related commitments.
Another fear of mine was that I might feel isolated and different from the rest of the staff: I only speak a few words of Lithuanian, and my work colleagues here do not speak Russian. Although we all speak English, for some reason I thought that it would be difficult to communicate. As it turned out, I could not have been more wrong – today, these people are my friends, they are always there to help and give advice”, says Karyna.
Would miss the never-ending festivals and the Mount of Gediminas
Although Karyna herself does not have much experience of this kind of work, she says that she rarely hears her friends and acquaintances talking of such a fun and exciting working culture and atmosphere as the one she is working in. When asked about the main differences between Lithuania and Belarus, she says that she was particularly surprised by the interactions between work colleagues.
“I was very pleasantly surprised: in Lithuania, it is customary to celebrate your birthday, Christmas or Valentine’s Day with colleagues. On International Women’s Day, colleagues spoiled us with coffee and muffins and good wishes. In Belarus, events such as these are not celebrated at work and colleagues rarely congratulate each other on their birthdays”, said Karyna.
Besides her work colleagues, Karyna says she would miss the Mount of Gediminas the most, were she to leave Lithuania. This site, rarely visited by Vilnius locals, holds a particular fascination for her.
“This is a romantic place where I come to admire the whole city and to watch planes landing. This scenery opens up in the evening, when the lights are switched on. Unfortunately, access to the castle was limited in winter, and this was yet another reason to wait for the spring”, Karyna says of her favourite spot in the city.
When asked what advice she would give to any of her countrymen coming to Lithuania, Karyna said she has noticed that Belarusians mostly come to buy things rather than to sightsee and gain new experiences.
“I realise why people do this –most of the goods people buy in Lithuania cost substantially more in Belarus or are not available at all. However, I would strongly advise them to spend more time on leisure and seeing Lithuania, which indeed has many things to show”, concludes Karyna.

                Service Portfolio
            
Transcom’s service portfolio is designed to enable the creation of outstanding customer experiences, while also reducing cost and helping to drive growth for our clients.
Our suite of services includes customer care, sales, technical support and credit management services, delivered through our extensive network of contact centers and our work-at-home agent network. Our customer experience specialists engage with your customers in multiple channels, including phone, e-mail, chat and in social media communities.
 
Customer service
Transcom’s service-focused agents deliver service excellence in order to help create competitive differentiation for your business. They are thoroughly trained to support best-in-class product, service and brand experiences for your customers.
We understand that every service interaction is an opportunity to reinforce buying decisions and strengthen brand relationships. We also know that delivering great service experiences can create a strong point of differentiation for your business, strengthening customer loyalty while improving retention and sales in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This is why we are acutely focused on continuously analyzing, scoring and improving on service quality, accuracy, speed, efficiency and sales targets. And, even more importantly, we focus on the relationships between these metrics and their impact on how your customers see you.
Our services are delivered through a structured and proven process with rigorous quality controls. Continuous improvement practices, focused on strengthening service quality and enhancing operational efficiency, are embedded into our daily operations. We constantly validate the impact of our service delivery on customer experience, e.g. through Customer Satisfaction, Customer Effort, and Net Promoter indices. And we map these key experience indicators back to key operational metrics, such as average handle time, average speed to answer and first contact resolution.
 
Technical support
Transcom’s technical product support solutions are tailored to deliver end user experiences through tiered support models, from the simplest questions to more complex support scenarios. Our technical support agents go through extensive product training and they have access to detailed knowledge databases to assure that they have the skills, support and tools needed in order to resolve your customers’ issues satisfactorily at the first contact.
We continuously analyze customer contact data to improve efficiency and end-user experience, e.g. through identifying issues that typically drive low-complexity calls to higher-cost support agents. This allows us to identify opportunities to free up technical support specialists for higher-complexity customer issues, while improving access to self-service options and giving customers greater control over their experience.
 
Customer retention
Preventing defection and maximizing the lifetime of a customer are key objectives for Transcom’s customer retention initiatives.
Transcom’s customer retention specialists are highly skilled at listening, understanding and resolving more complicated customer issues that could threaten your customer relationships. Our retention training programs focus on teaching agents how to show empathy, diffuse customer anger, and get to the heart of the issue in order to resolve problems quickly and mitigate customer defection.
In today’s socially driven marketplace, unhappy customers’ voices are amplified in social forums. Mishandled complaints can go viral in an instant, with potentially disastrous effects on brand reputation. By resolving critical customer issues, we not only protect your revenue streams. We can also turn potential defectors into fans.
 
Customer acquisition
Transcom adds value to your sales efforts by acquiring new customers cost-efficiently, and by building strong customer relationships as a basis for future interactions.
Our sales specialists are extensively trained, not only on your clients’ products and services but also on competitors’ offerings. This ensures that they are in the best possible position to convey the value of your products and services, and to secure sales.
Transcom’s in-house training programs, sales incentives, and call guides all support the sales process by making sure that our agents are skilled at uncovering customer needs, identifying the right offerings to fit those needs, and secure customer orders.
 
Cross-selling & upselling
By delivering an outstanding service experience, our agents strengthen customer loyalty and create future sales opportunities (“sales-through-service”). But we also help you to generate new sales directly from your existing customer base, both by increasing sales of the same product and by selling additional products.
Transcom has the capability to support varied and complex products, and to introduce them effectively to customers in day-to-day service interactions.
Successful cross-selling and upselling efforts require more than just an understanding of product and service features and benefits. Agents need to be adept at the art of building relationships with customers, identifying customer needs during any type of interaction, and taking appropriate action to satisfy the customer’s need while maximizing cross-sales and upsales for you.
 
Collections
Early collections
In the early collections area, Transcom’s primary objectives are to resolve debt, rehabilitate customers and reduce incidence of future debt. Whenever possible, this is achieved through immediate repayment. If not, we attempt to agree on realistic repayment terms through a relationship-sensitive approach, using frequent reminders if necessary.
