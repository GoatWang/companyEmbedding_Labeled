Wirecard has been collaborating with Alipay since 2015, to offer Chinese tourists a familiar payment method during their travels in Europe. As part of this, Wirecard has integrated this alternative payment method into the till systems of retailers such as Printemps, The Body Shop and The National Bank of Greece.[10][11][12] Since July 2017, Wirecard has partnered with Tencent to also offer WeChat Pay.[13]
In the mobile payments sector, Wirecard has negotiated several contracts with telecommunications providers for technical services with regard to mobile smartphone payments based on near-field communication (NFC). The payment processor offers its partners a mobile card reader as a white label programme for the acceptance of card payments via smartphones or tablets.
In 2015, Wirecard introduced the fully digitised mobile payment app, boon.[14] It is based on a virtual prepaid Mastercard and runs on smartphones with Android or iOS operating systems. Currently, the Android version is available in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland. At the moment, boon. can be used with Apple Pay in France, the UK, Switzerland and Italy.

Internet banking payments









worldwide in real time
Through a range of online banking payment methods, customers who do not own a credit or debit card are also given the option of making secure online payments. This increases the conversion rate and customer satisfaction. Wirecard offers different online bank transfer options on a single platform, which only has to be integrated into your payment page once, a process which is very easy to complete.
Transaction costs are extremely low and you will receive immediate payment confirmation in real time. You can supply the ordered product or service immediately, because the order can no longer be cancelled by the customer. 
Our range of services covers four continents: Asia, Europe/Eastern Europe, the Pacific region (incl. Australia and Oceania) and South America.

Features & benefits


Multi-Channel Payment Gateway


The Multi-Channel Payment Gateway, which is linked to 200 international payment networks (banks, payment solutions, card networks) provides payment and acquiring acceptance via the Wirecard Bank and global banking partners, including the integrated risk and fraud management systems. In addition, for example, country-specific payment and debit systems as well as industry-specific access solutions such as BSP (Bank Settlement Plan) or the encryption of payment data during payment transfers (tokenization) are provided. In addition, Wirecard offers call centre services (24/7) with trained native speakers in 16 languages.




Payment acceptance/credit card acquiring


Wirecard supports all sales channels with payment acceptance for credit cards and alternative payment solutions (multi-brand), technical transaction processing and settlement in several currencies, and it offers the corresponding POS terminal infrastructure as well as numerous other services. In addition to Principal Membership with Visa and MasterCard, there are also acquiring license agreements with JCB, American Express, Discover/Diners and UnionPay. Banking services such as forex management supplement outsourcing for financial processes.




Risk management solutions


Wide-ranging tools are available for the use of risk management technology to minimize fraud scenarios and to prevent fraud (fraud/risk management). The Fraud Prevention Suite (FPS) uses rule-based decision-making logic (rule engine) and offers extensive reports, for example which proportion of transactions was rejected and why. In addition, FPS analyzes whether exclusively fraudulent transactions are rejected. Age verification, KYC identification (know your customer), analysis using device fingerprinting, hotlists and much more is included in the risk management strategies. An international network of service providers who have specialized in creditworthiness checks can also be included depending on the merchant’s business model.




Issuing solutions


The offering for issuing solutions includes managing card accounts and processing card transactions (issuing processing) as well as issuing various card types, mostly Visa and MasterCard. The card number can be used in connection with a plastic card, virtually or in connection with a SIM card in mobile devices, or it can be used on a sticker or in the chip and magnetic strips on a plastic card for dual use (dual interface).
Wirecard offers an SP-TSM Gateway (service provider-trusted service manager), which can be integrated into all major systems. In addition, Wirecard operates its own SP-TSM server. SP-TSM is used to provision card data in the form of secure elements in a mobile device, and includes, for example, card management, card personalization and PIN management.




Solutions for mobile payments


The Wallet Solution is based on a (white-label) platform which makes it possible to manage credit balance accounts and provides technical support for customer legitimation processes (KYC), peer-to-peer money transfers and various top-up processes - and is compliant with national and regional regulations for the issue of Visa or MasterCard products. The platform has user interfaces for administrative functions (e.g., call center) and for consumers. These can access their wallet both via the Internet and also using their cellphone in the form of smartphone apps. The wallet solution supports peer-to-peer money transfers and also Internet payments, via the cellphone (in-app payment) and also in bricks-and-mortar retail via NFC and QR codes.

Together, the two companies have launched the GambioPay payment solution on the market. Gambio GmbH offers more than 20,000 SMEs end-to-end e-commerce solutions for online shops. For this product, Wirecard will take over all payment processing as well as risk management on behalf of its long-standing partner Gambio. The leading provider of internet technology facilitates five payment methods (credit card payment, SOFORT online bank transfer, pre-payment, purchase on account and SEPA direct debit) from a single source by integrating the Wirecard Checkout Portal in GambioPay. Gambio merchants will therefore have simple access to payment methods relevant to their business in future.In Germany, an increasing number of merchants are offering their products for sale on their own online shop. Providing customers with the right mix of payment options to make convenient and direct payments is, of course, a key success factor. With this cooperation, Wirecard and Gambio are now leading the way in terms of innovative payment systems for online retail in Germany.In this way, Gambio merchants will no longer have to deal with various suppliers in order to offer their customers a wide variety of payment solutions. By integrating the Wirecard Checkout Portal in GambioPay, Wirecard is equipped to take care of the full payment process.
