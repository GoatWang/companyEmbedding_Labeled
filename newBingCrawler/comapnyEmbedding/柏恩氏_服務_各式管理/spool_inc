Naturally Aqua Products (11)

Naturally Aqua is a product line dedicated to enviro-friendly solutions. These products will compliment your sanitation system and maintenance products. They will greatly reduce your weekly maintenance. Our two leading products in this line are based on enzyme technology: Naturally Aqua Pool & Spa Natural Enzymes and Naturally Aqua Enzyme Plus. These products can offer you a solution to some common pool & spa problems. Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions that break down and remove organic accumulations around the waterline, skimmer and in the filter. Body oils are especially a problem in spas due to a small volume of heated water. Enzymes are enviro-friendly and will work with all types of sanitizers.
Consult your Pool & Spa Professional to see which products will work best for you.

	  		CuLator	  	


















CuLator is the easy way to rid pools and spas of metals like copper, nickel, manganese, cobalt, silver and iron - contaminants which stain pool walls and hardware and turn water cloudy.

	  		Enzyme Plus 2 L	  	


















Naturally Aqua Enzyme Plus is an ideal weekly maintenance product that tackles the common issues faced by pool owners: Lotion and oil buildup, algae and water clarity.
























	  		Natural Brite 1 L	  	


















Natural Brite is a concentrated “chitosan” based clarifier made from crustacean shells. It coagulates tiny particles and deposits them on the filter for easy removal. The results make pool water sparkle. 
























	  		Natural Enzymes Spa 1 L

By removing the phosphates you will dramatically reduce the risk of getting algae and increase the efficiency of sanitizers and salt generators.
Have your Pool Professional test your water for phosphates.

This powerful formula will eliminate cloudy water, scum and odour.  It keeps the filter clean by breaking down bather waste and organic accumulations. Natural Enzymes will remove “bathtub” ring without having to scrub thus reducing weekly maintenance.

	  		Stain Prevent 1 L	  	


















Stain Prevent is a highly concentrated formula for the prevention of metal staining and scale formation.
Stain Prevent does not contain phosphates like many sequestering agents. Have your Pool Professional test for metals in your pool water. If metals are present add the Stain Prevent to protect the pool from staining. Next add the CuLator to completely remove the metals from the water.
