Real Estate Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Real Estate (realty or real property) signifies a patch of land coupled with buildings and any other structures affixed to it permanently. Real Estate also refers to business and/or housing properties typically sold by estate agents (usually) or by the owners themselves. Resting upon its usage, Real Estate can be vastly classified into the commercial, residential (housing) and industrial types.
Worldwide, the Real Estate Market is affected by political scenario and economic context, demographic forces, job opportunities, and various climatic parameters. The commercial market segment is on the mend by degrees due to elevated capital availability and the refreshment of processing industry activity. However, a rather wishy-washy recovery is noticed in the housing sector of the advanced world particularly. Meantime, the Chinese, Indian, Australian, Thai and Vietnamese Real Estate Markets, among others, are rather promising within the Asia Pacific.
The research reports under this Catalogue give unparalleled knowledge of the worldwide Real Estate Industry, disclosing major market restraints and growth pushers, segmentation, sizing (value/volume) and tempos of growth. Regional and individual country markets are also closely analyzed in the research reports. Big-to-small companies involved and the competitive environment are examined, and also granular forecasts are at hand in the research reports.

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

Manufacturing & Construction Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The Manufacturing sector covers work performed in mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products also falls under Manufacturing unless the activity is appropriately classified in Construction.
The Construction sector primarily covers work performed in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). 
	 Companies that perform work in the preparation of sites for new construction and those involved subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in Construction.

Manufacturing uses raw materials that are products of agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or quarrying, as well as products of other manufacturing operations. Plants, factories, or mills that characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment, transform the raw materials into new finished products or components of products that require further manufacturing.

Construction markets include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these enterprises generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities are specified contractually with construction project owners (prime contractors) or contracts with other construction companies (subcontractors).

Construction companies that contract responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but are also markets known as design-build, construction management, turnkey contracting, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contracting. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as
