Kuwait-based Integrated Logistics Company has signed an order for 12 new Demag all-terrain cranes from Terex Cranes.
The regional logistics heavyweight’s order includes two AC 130-5, four AC 160-5, and six AC 300-6 crane models, said a statement from Terex, adding that delivery of the new cranes is scheduled for later this year. Integrated Logistics plans to put the cranes to work at several oil refineries throughout the Gulf region.
Salah Al Huwaidi, CEO of Integrated Logistics, said that the company selected Demag after much consideration because each crane model has best-in-class boom lengths and offers interchangeable components.
“Besides being impressed with the product line, we’ve always received fast, reliable service from Terex Cranes — they really go above and beyond for us,” he added.
This recent order for the 12 new Demag cranes comes less than a year after Integrated Logistics took delivery of an order for more than 30 Demag and Terex cranes. Terex added that the Kuwaiti company is also planning to enhance its fleet by repeating the same order of 12 more Demag cranes in the future.(c) 2017 notice  Corporate Publishing International.
