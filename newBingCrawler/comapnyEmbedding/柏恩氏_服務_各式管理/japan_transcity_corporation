            warehouse operator near the Port of Yokkaichi, this century-old company has now grown into an International Multimodal Transportation Service

              (and counting) offices and associates in the five continents is to make sure your door-to-door shipments can be delivered effectively and efficiently.  
           



Custom Brokerage
We are the licensed Custom Agent granted by Custom Malaysia, representing you in custom declaration, providing consultancy on bonded, 
              free-zone and LMW (Licensed Manufacturer Warehouse) regulations. We also advise you the type of import and export license required for your

Many have opted for lorry to deliver their cargo between Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore, due to shorter transit and less cargo handling.

Factory Manpower Supply
Operating mainly from Kuantan, we manage a team of general and skilled factory workers for petro-chemical factories that see the advantage 
              of outsourcing their factory workers to a third party. We are currently providing this service to a few multinational companies in Kuantan
              on contractual basis.

From containerized cargo, we have moved on to handle liquidized cargo. We are now the Malaysian Agent for international Isotank Operator, 
              Transliquids.
