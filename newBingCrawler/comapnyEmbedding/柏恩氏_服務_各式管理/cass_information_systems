 The Six Best Practices in Freight Audit & Payment 



   From 
   Cass Information Systems Inc.


Like many other groups within the organization, transportation and logistics are feeling the pressure to get more done in an increasingly complicated environment, while simultaneously finding new ways to control expenses and manage the movement of goods more efficiently. A great opportunity for expense control and process improvement lies within the auditing and paying of freight bills. Well-designed,implemented and maintained systems and processes for managing freight bills produce significant benefits far beyond successful rate audits and on-time payments.

                History
            




From its humble roots as a local St. Louis bank, to the leading provider of enterprise expense management solutions, Cass has a proud history of evolving and growing with our clients. 



 



Cass Information Systems grew out of the services originally offered by Cass Commercial Bank, which began in 1906. As the area shifted from residential to commercial, Cass shifted its focus in order to serve the banking needs of privately held companies in the area. Through the Depression, Cass remained one of the stronger banks in St. Louis.
In 1956, Cass banking customers came to Cass needing a solution to meet Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regulations regarding timely payment of their freight bills. Three decades later, deregulation of transportation gave these companies a new opportunity to better manage their freight costs. With this came the demand for data to better manage this considerable corporate cost. 
Our freight payment business grew quickly, and Cass Information Systems, Inc. was formed. Cass Bank became a business unit of the new corporation. 
Cass continued to grow its freight payment business with a number of acquisitions: Comtrac, in 1987; Bank of Boston, in 1994; and the freight payment business of a number of banks during the 90s. As a pioneer in the freight payment business, Cass has remained the market leader for freight audit, payment and business intelligence services. 
In 1994, when energy costs were skyrocketing, Cass recognized an opportunity to help large energy users with utility expense management. Large organizations are increasingly interested in reducing their carbon footprint for brand image reasons, along with overall objectives to simply drive down operational costs. Today, Cass is the premier provider of back-office utility bill processing and business intelligence, helping organizations better understand their energy spend and quantify the success of their initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. 
Cass Information Systems became a publicly-held company in 1996.
In 2004, Cass further expanded its payables offerings through the acquisition of ProfitLab, a leading telecom expense management (TEM) provider. Since that time, our TEM services and technology have evolved to address the entire spectrum of telecom lifecycle management, for fixed and wireless communications. Today Cass is a proven TEM leader with a list of marquee clients.
Cass celebrated its 100th year anniversary in 2006. Our anniversary presentation provides a unique look at our rich heritage. 
Early 2011 saw the opening of Cass’ Europe/Middle East/Asia (EMEA) location in Breda, Netherlands to better serve the expanding global needs of our customers. Cass achieved record results in 2011, surpassing $100 million in revenues and earning $23 million in net profits. During this record-year, Cass processed more than 42 million invoices. Customer accounts payable processed and paid by Cass in 2011 totaled $32 billion for freight, parcel, telecom, energy and water. 
In 2012, Cass completed its acquisition of Waste Reduction Consultants, a fast-growing provider of waste expense management services based in Jacksonville, Florida. This acquisition again broadened the Cass product line. As companies acknowledge savings opportunities through more proactive management of their waste services and contracts, as well as formulate new sustainability and recycling initiatives, this is a service in increasingly-growing demand. 
Cass continued its global expansion in early 2017 with the acquisition of Efftel, a privately held telecom expense management provider based in the UK.
Today, with $1.5 billion in assets, Cass manages $44 billion in payables. As a growing, profitable publicly held company (NASDAQ: CASS), Cass offers corporate clients a wide range of expense management and supply chain finance solutions.   
 
 
 























Managing nearly $44 billion in supplier payments on behalf of our clients,
Cass helps businesses manage expenses and supplier payments–accurately, efficiently and on time–no matter how complex the business process, the pricing model, the contract, the discount schedule or the invoice. Some of the largest companies in the world trust Cass to deliver accurate insights into their costs for freight, utilities, telecom, mobility, waste, recycling and other expenses. Founded in 1906, Cass Commercial Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary and a Federal Reserve member bank that provides Cass and its clients with secure payment controls.
