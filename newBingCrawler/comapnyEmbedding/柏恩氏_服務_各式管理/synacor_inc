Video Aggregation Done Right Synacor’s Watch product is a streaming video service that gives consumers one place to find TV shows, movies, and short-form videos from every genre. For broadband and pay-TV providers and device manufacturers, we’ve unified the fragmented online video market with a consumer experience that brings together video from a wide range of sources. Give your consumers unlimited access to entertaining video content they can watch on every device.





Watch One-Pager (PDF)











Search & Discovery of All Sources. We enable distributors to aggregate and merchandise many content sources into one place. Our product supports Live TV and On Demand, traditional video on demand (VOD), pay-per-transaction (TVOD), subscription (SVOD), over-the-top (OTT) and more. We give consumers one place to find what they want to watch and more options for how they can watch it.






Approved Experiences. Synacor is dedicated to navigating the complex operator marketing group and understanding what individual programmers require for approved experiences—so you don’t have to. Our industry experience, close relationships with leading video programming distributors and flexible products allow us to solve for a large range of business rules for our customers.






Flexible Playback Options. Stream content through Synacor’s universal video platform that securely processes, protects and delivers video to any device. Alternatively, we can adjust our video playback experience based on a variety of business rules: deep-link to a player contained on a website in an app, play in a syndicated web player, or integrate with your own software development kit (SDK).






Native and Browser-Based. Present a unified guide to your consumers on every screen. Our product’s core application powers the consumer-facing experience on every browser and on the most popular mobile devices like the iPad, iPhone and Android tablets and smartphones.






Smart Recommendations. Your customers never have to start from scratch when they’re looking for something to watch. We use a mix of hand-picked recommendations and advanced technology to enhance the search & discovery process.  Our in-house curation team surfaces new and popular videos, and our platform suggests content to consumers based on their interests and past viewing habits.






TV Controls. Our service puts consumers in control of their viewing experience. Intelligent notifications let consumers know when their favorite shows are on and reminds them to watch live, schedule a recording or save to their Watchlist for viewing later on any device. Advanced features like channel tune let your subscribers find the program they want to watch and change the channel on their TV—all from our product.






Personalization. We leverage data about individual consumers—including access rights, opt-in preferences and past search behaviors—to deliver a truly personalized experience. Consumers can also customize their search & discovery experience to show only the channels, networks and services they subscribe to, or programming that’s available to watch right now.

Fully Featured. Our email product has a rich feature set that collects all the functionality your customers want in one place, from any device. Our service can also be extended with advanced features like voicemail, SMS, and social media integration.






Secure Hosting and Delivery. We offer hosting and management of millions of mailboxes that deliver billions of messages reliably and consistently. Our 1 million square foot, Tier 4 data center covers seven time zones around the world for secure infrastructure that safely stores data. We’re proud to say we’ve consistently exceeded our Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments.






Migration Experts. Worried about changing email hosts? Our in-house experts have years of experience migrating millions of mailboxes from every major email platform—including Google, Microsoft, Earthlink, Openwave, Oracle, Mirapoint and many others—so switching to our system is easy and hassle-free.






Seamless, Branded Experience. Your email product should feel like an extension of your company’s other digital properties, not something that’s tacked on to your other offerings. Unlike other email hosts, our white-label product is completely customizable to fit your brand’s look and feel, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.






Improve Your Bottom Line. Our platform offers optional advertising opportunities to increase your revenue without compromising the quality of your email experience—or your customers’ privacy. We also offer services and tools that can help reduce your email-related call center requests.






Industry Partnerships. We’ve built the leading solutions for email storage, security, spam protection, bounced emails and more right into our product. Our industry partnerships help us deliver a safe, reliable and enjoyable email experience for your customers.
