Packaging & Containers Company Research Reports


Packaging and Containers Companies provide lots of industries, mostly food and drinks, household goods, and pharma sectors, with offerings allowing for the dispensing and protecting of products. These include, among others, carton; aerosol valves; plastic and polyethylene tanks; metal cans; storing and trash bags; glass bottles; damping materials; gift wrappings; steel and plastics drums, or, those made of fiber.
Even with its key end use markets characterized by stability, the Packaging and Containers Industry is not proof against macroeconomic fluctuations. Diversified companies are usually best placed to weather economic down-cycles. To remain a success and reap tangible profits, most industry participants tend to sustain balanced cost structure. However, volatile oil-based product prices can pose a challenge to efficient cost management. Packaging and Container producers are serving customers from pole to pole, especially focusing on the emerging Chinese, Indian and Brazilian markets.
This Catalogue encompasses a batch of research reports giving a full picture of Packaging and Containers Companies along with in-depth reviews of the pertinent industry. The research reports examine companies’ strategic positioning in the marketplace, financial ratios, besides including SWOT analyses. The information on Packaging and Containers Companies’ history, leading products or services, major employees, and more is available in the research reports too.

COMPANY
Wellex Manufacturing is a full-service manufacturing facility that specializes in valves and the fabrication of valve automation hardware. We are known in the valve industry for our high quality products, on-time deliveries, design capacity, and quick turn-around. For us, no job is too small or quantity too large.
For over 50 years Wellex Manufacturing has been recognized as a partner with our customers. We pride ourselves in building strong, lasting relationships with our customers and meeting their every valve need.
At Wellex Manufacturing, we are customer exclusive. Not having a product line of our own, we design and manufacture only to our customers’ needs and at their request. We bring the most modern technology available to serve you and your needs faster and more cost effectively.
HISTORY
Wellex Manufacturing was founded in 1963 as a vendor in the construction of the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Zimmer power plant in Moscow, Ohio. Starting out as a specialty small quantity manufacturer, we diversified into more production machining that quickly focused on the valve industry. We specialized in high end, tight tolerance internal valve components made from many different types of materials. See Manufacturing Capacities for more details.
In 2010, we acquired another manufacturing facility that was also very strong in the valve industry. This company focused more on the valve automation and valve bracket business. The combination of these two companies resulted in a great, full service manufacturing company able to cater to all the needs of our valve customers – manufactures and distributors alike.
In the beginning, we prided ourselves on working with our customers and meeting their every unique need. Almost 50 years later, and with a much larger Wellex, this philosophy continues.

About Wellex



Company
Wellex Manufacturing is a full-service manufacturing facility that specializes in valves and the fabrication of valve automation hardware. We are known in the valve industry for our high quality products, on-time deliveries, design capacity, and quick turn-around. For us, no job is too small or quantity too large.
For over 50 years Wellex Manufacturing has been recognized as a partner with our customers. We pride ourselves in building strong, lasting relationships with our customers and meeting their every valve need.
At Wellex Manufacturing, we are customer exclusive. Not having a product line of our own, we design and manufacture only to our customers’ needs and at their request. We bring the most modern technology available to serve you and your needs faster and more cost effectively.
History
Wellex Manufacturing was founded in 1963 as a vendor in the construction of the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Zimmer power plant in Moscow, Ohio. Starting out as a specialty small quantity manufacturer, we diversified into more production machining that quickly focused on the valve industry. We specialized in high end, tight tolerance internal valve components made from many different types of materials. See Manufacturing Capacities for more details.
In 2010, we acquired another manufacturing facility that was also very strong in the valve industry. This company focused more on the valve automation and valve bracket business. The combination of these two companies resulted in a great, full service manufacturing company able to cater to all the needs of our valve customers – manufactures and distributors alike.

In the beginning, we prided ourselves on working with our customers and meeting their every unique need. Almost 50 years later, and with a much larger Wellex, this philosophy continues.
