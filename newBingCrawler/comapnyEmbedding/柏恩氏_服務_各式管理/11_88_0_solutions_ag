Follow-up: 11 88 0 Solutions AG (telegate AG) 

23 April, 201723 April, 2017 ~ Cigarrfimpar  ~ Leave a comment 

Q4 2016 – 0,48 € – ETR:TGT
After my thirteen months follow-up I have decided to sell my position in TGT. After brokerage fees and currency effects the return amounted to -51,7 %.
11 88 0 Solutions AG, formerly Telegate AG, is a Germany-based provider of directory assistance and call center services. The Company operates through two segments: Directory Assistance and Digital. The Directory Assistance segment provides services related to inquires made at by phone for information regarding to phone numbers, pre-dial numbers and addresses. The Digital segment receives revenue from advertisements on the Company’s platforms and Websites. The Company also offers online marketing services related to Google AdWords, Google My Business, social media Websites and company profiles on platforms, as well as tools and market analyses, and software for data, address and network management. – Google Finance.
1. The company is currently a net-net with an adequate margin of safety: 

P/NCAV < 1x

0,75x ✓ 

MoS = 25 %


1,7x (incl. operating leases).



Assessment of margin of safety:
Although the company is still a net-net and makes it through the rest of my checklist I regard the current margin of safety as inadequate. This is based on an assessment of the NCAV-brun rate that is negative for both YoY = -41 % and QoQ = -20 %. In other words, there is a high probability that the NCAV will continue to erode in a quick pace and that the 25 % margin of safety is gone by next follow-up. Also, taking operating leases into consideration the company is no longer to be regarded as a net-net as it is selling at a premium, 1,7x. This is relevant since TGT uses IFRS and the changes to be effective as of 1 January 2019 with IFRS 16 (operating leases are to be capitalized). Based on these notations and that I haven’t found any other value creation catalyst I have decided to sell my position in TGT.
2. The risk of permanent loss is low:
2.1 The risk of bankruptcy is low (criterion a) or b) must be met):
a)

Debt/Equity < 25 %

0 % ✓



b)

Z-score ≥ 3

0,2 X



2.2 The company’s business model has historically been profitable (criterion a) or b) must be met):
a)

Positive retained earnings:

-28M € X



b)

Positive aggregate operating income for the last ten years:

  118M € ✓



3. The company does not have a shareholder unfriendly capital allocation:

Shareholder yield TTM ≥ -2 %

Dividend yield TTM = 0 %
Net buyback yield TTM = 0 %

=  0 % ✓

      11880 Solutions AG optimistic after the end of the first quarter of 2017:
    

      EBITDA at break-even - costs reduced considerably - significant customer growth
    

      Munich / Essen, 10 May 2017 - 11880 Solutions AG today announced that it reached break- even EBITDA of EUR 0.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 (Q1 2016: EUR -0.2 million).
    

      Costs were significantly reduced compared to the previous year: net cash flow was EUR -0.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 (Q1 2016: EUR -1.8 million), primarily driven by one-off severance costs of EUR 0.7 million arising from the latest personnel measures. The Company has reported a clear upward trend since the start of the current financial year for the first time since 2011, with the number of customers in the digital business rising by four percent in the past three months alone.
    

      "We are finally on the right track and aim to report a profit no later than 2019," said Christian Maar, Chief Executive Officer of 11880 Solutions AG. "We have succeeded in stopping the loss of customers of the past five years and reversing this trend. We are currently experiencing significant customer growth and are extremely satisfied with the development of all of our key sales figures. In the past 18 months, we have created a competitive product portfolio that is causing the number of new customers to steadily increase as terminations continue to decline. Interest in our products is so significant that we have recruited external resources to support our sales efforts. At the same time, we are continuing to adjust our administrative organisation and are lowering costs again this year."
    

      11880 Solutions AG posted revenue of EUR 10.4 million in the first three months of the current financial year (Q1 2016: EUR 11.8 million). Of this amount, the directory assistance business accounted for EUR 3.7 million (Q1 2016: EUR 4.1 million) and the digital business for EUR 6.7 million (Q1 2016: EUR 7.6 million).
    

      During the current financial year, 11880 Solutions AG is focusing its operational efforts on its new sector portals and the WerkenntdenBesten.de search engine. The specialist portals for the most important trades and service sectors are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, as they enable anyone to obtain a non-binding yet detailed quote for their individual job in just a few clicks. By creating WerkenntdenBesten.de, the first independent search engine for online reviews, 11880* has developed a platform that offers unparalleled value for both consumers and companies. The site gathers all of the customer reviews published online for a service provider, doctor, tradesman or fitness studio in one place.
    

      "Our new offering brings smaller companies and their customers together online so effectively that it will rapidly establish itself as an indispensable part of everyday life. We are convinced of that," said Christian Maar.
