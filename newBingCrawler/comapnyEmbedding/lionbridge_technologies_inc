Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. Introduces GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management
Jun 26 17
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. announced the availability of GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management, an omni-channel translation and interpretation solution that enables organizations to provide multilingual helpdesk and service support without hiring or maintaining bilingual staff. By eliminating language barriers across communications channels, from chat and ticketing to voice and knowledge base, GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management improves productivity and efficiency, while increasing speed of response and resolution. Lionbridge also introduced GeoFluent for ServiceNow®, a certified integration between its customizable real-time translation solution and ServiceNow Connect and Incident Management. Available in the ServiceNow Store, the pre-built connection enables service management staff to chat and support tickets across more than 100 languages using their existing ServiceNow platform. The GeoFluent platform includes three modules that serve each area of service desks' multilingual service desk and service management needs: GeoFluent Virtual Translator™ adds support for over 100 languages to customers' existing self-service and agent-assisted digital communications platforms, including chat, email and ticketing. GeoFluent Virtual Translator includes an AI-based core that is customized and trained specifically for each client, and ensures multilingual consistency and accuracy across languages, channels and use cases, while understanding the context and unique brand, channel, use case acronyms and terminology. GeoFluent Interpreter™ provides over-the-phone (OPI) interpretation support for more than 350 languages, available 24x7x365. Given the prevalence of voice communications in enterprise service desks, Lionbridge is changing the traditional OPI experience to make voice interactions faster, more efficient, use less client staff time, all while reducing effort. GeoFluent Translate™ provides clients a self-service and secure way to quickly translate virtually any file or document type. GeoFluent for Enterprise Service Management is the newest solution in the GeoFluent platform. In 2016, Lionbridge introduced GeoFluent for Contact Centers solution, a suite of applications and services tailored to meet the real-time, multilingual communications needs of customer care organizations. With today's announcement, Lionbridge is bringing the GeoFluent platform to enterprise service management, helping enterprise helpdesks and service desks solve their unique real-time multilingual communications challenges.


Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc
Jun 5 17
Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notified investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Lionbridge securities on January 27, 2017, in connection with an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 12, 2016, by and among Lionbridge, LBT Acquisition, Inc. and LBT Merger Sub, Inc. under which Lionbridge stockholders received $5.75 per share in cash and Lionbridge became a wholly owned subsidiary of H.I.G. Capital L.L.C. This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Complaint alleges that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Lionbridge's prospects and value in order encourage shareholders to accept the Merger. The complaint continues to allege that on January 31, 2017, defendants caused the company to file with the SEC a Definitive Proxy Statement in which the members of the Board recommended that stockholders vote their shares in favor of the Merger Agreement. The Proxy Statement disclosed management projections that contemplated revenue growth over the next several years of less than 3.9% per year. Those projections were allegedly inconsistent with Lionbridge's average revenue growth of about 7% per year from 2011 to 2015, and with the defendants' actual strategic plans for the company. On February 28, 2017, majority of the Lionbridge stockholders voted in favor of the Merger Agreement and later that day the company and HIG completed the Merger.

Lionbridge Enhances inRiver Product Information Management Connector to Fully Automate Multilingual Product Content








Lionbridge connector seamlessly integrates translation and PIM capabilities to improve global customer engagement


WALTHAM, Mass. -March 22, 2017 - Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. today announced updates to the Lionbridge connector for the inRiver product information management (PIM) platform. The connector allows businesses to seamlessly integrate Lionbridge's industry-leading translation automation technology with inRiver's award-winning PIM software, enabling them to easily create ecommerce experiences for customers around the globe.  The Lionbridge connector is compatible with inRiver's cloud and desktop platforms, allowing product marketing teams to manage translation projects from any location, at any time.
      

        'We worked closely with our customers to collect feedback and build a translation experience that enables them to be more efficient and productive in reaching global markets,' said Anja Schaefer, Vice President, Global Solutions at Lionbridge. 'The new Lionbridge connector for inRiver significantly reduces the workload on product marketing teams while providing full control over content distribution. We designed the connector for organizations to have the confidence to effectively reach their target markets with their products and services while saving time and cost.'
      

        Effective PIM depends on managing content scattered throughout the organization and making it available to customers and partners around the world. Managing content in one language is difficult, and extending PIM to multiple languages increases complexity and poses a number of challenges. The Lionbridge connector for inRiver PIM is compatible with the latest version of inRiver and features a fully automated, single-click translation process that optimizes the practice of creating and publishing the right product content in the right language. Managing product information and translations through this efficient process gives companies up to 72 percent faster time-to-market, with up to 44 percent lower translation costs.
      

        'We are pleased that Lionbridge continues to invest in enhancing our joint solution by releasing its new integration with inRiver PIM. This new integration will continue to improve our client's translation and overall Product Information Management working process.' Says Joe Golemba, VP Strategic Alliances of inRiver.
