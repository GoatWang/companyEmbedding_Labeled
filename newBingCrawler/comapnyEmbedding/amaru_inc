The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

M2B WORLD PTE. LTD. PARTNERS WITH INTENSE ANIMATION STUDIO TO PRODUCE FIRST ORIGINAL 3D SOCCER THEMED ANIMATION FOR ON-DEMAND ACCESS


Developed in Singapore for Global Distribution; Project Is Supported by The Media Development Authority of Singapore 


Singapore - November 15, 2005 - With World Cup football (US-soccer) fever just around the corner, M2B World Pte. Ltd. (M2B World), a subsidiary of Amaru Inc. (AMRU), in partnership with Intense Animation Studio, announced today the production of a unique, original 3D animated football-themed pilot program. The show, conceptualized and developed in Singapore for the global market, is slated for completion by end-February 2006 and will be accessible for on-demand broadband viewing via channels available through www.m2bworld.com.  

                  The project is the result of a synergy between Singapore-founded M2B World Pte. Ltd., a  leading global distributor in broadband streaming entertainment, and Intense Animation Studio (Intense), Singapore’s pioneer character animation, visual effects, training and production studio. This commercial project is a first for Intense, which was launched in 2004 by 17-year industry veteran Tony Sealy and Singapore Producer, Natra Mohsin in an effort to expand the pool of local animation talent. The concept development team is comprised of Sealy, experienced scriptwriter Graham Perkins and Creative/Animation Director Edward Bakst, working alongside the premiere talents from Intense as well as prominent regional animators.

                  At a press briefing today in Singapore, finalized character designs and 3D modeling of the primary characters in pre-production were presented, with animation production already well in progress. The program is intended for ongoing, episodic formatting and is supported by funding from the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) under the Digital Content Development Scheme.

                  The 12-minute English language pilot tentatively titled “Eleven” is currently being marketed in Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. Trailers of the pilot will also be distributed during the Asia Television Forum (Nov 30 – Dec 2), a strategic regional industry platform for media buyers and sellers. 

                  “The Singapore computer animation industry has the ability to offer strong, original, creative content, and be competitive within the international industry. This pilot and the series will go a long way towards developing the reputation of our local talent,” said Tony Sealy, Managing Director of Intense. “Moreover, with M2B World’s established global distribution channels, we are confident that this project will be commercially successful and help showcase Singapore’s capabilities as an animation hub.”

                  The key strength of this project is that it is an original, character and narrative driven production about football which has global appeal; in particular with the build towards the 2006 World Cup, and that it will be globally available on-demand via easily accessible broadband channels.

                  “Developing original and unique content is the next logical step towards M2B World’s growth in the on-demand entertainment market,” said Colin Binny, CEO of Amaru Inc. “We have been aggressively acquiring content over the last several years, with a view to offering original programming as well, the first of which will be the animation pilot. Through the growing global use of broadband, we are now delivering content to computers, mobile phones and PDA’s, as well as directly to televisions using IPTV set-top box technology, effectively satisfying the consumer need for on-demand personalized media experiences.”

                  The pilot will reflect a distinct multi-national feel and visual humor derived from the use state-of-art 3D animation techniques. At the same time, specialized 3D computer animation will allow for customized visual effects tailored to any scenario for embedded advertising - creating an alternative platform in a cluttered and competitive advertising market.  Animated characters will additionally be able to sport sponsored jerseys and shoes with at-ground advertising and legitimate product placement can be embedded within the animated content.  The animation can also be adapted to the specific needs of individual countries via the injection of local product placement or various language voiceovers according to region.   

                  “We are pleased that Intense and M2B World are partnering to produce an original animation project and plan to market it internationally,” said Mr Seto Lok Yin, the MDA's Director for Industry Development. “Beyond production and distribution, we encourage the two companies to maximize other platforms to publicise their works. For instance, merchandising and licensing offer tremendous opportunities to extend the reach of their project globally.”

                  In addition, M2B World Pte. Ltd. is marketing to conventional media channels such as local free-to-air TV and cable networks. A dedicated website will be set up on the M2B World broadband network in support of the global marketing effort and will provide a forum for direct interaction between viewers and fans.
