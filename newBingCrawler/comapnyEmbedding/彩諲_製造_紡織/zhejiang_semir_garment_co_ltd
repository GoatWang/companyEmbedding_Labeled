                                        The Semir Group was founded on December 18, 1996 and currently includes two online branded services Semir and Balabala. Semir was created in 1998 and has since become a leading brand for casual clothing. It has also been named a listed Well-Known Brand, a Chinese brand name and has qualified for exemption from quality checks. Balabala first appeared in 2002 and is well known among China's urbanites for children's clothing and was among the first brands to be named a "Chinese Children's Brand Name. "

In 2008, company revenue reached RMB 5.87 billion and paid RMB 303 million in taxes. We have been the top corporate tax payer in Wenzhou for the past three years running and have remained in the top 100 companies in terms of sales and profit among throughout China's clothing industry for nine years running. We have also been named among the top 500 privately owned enterprises in China and is one of China's Top 10 clothing manufacturers in terms of competition.

The Semir Group uses what we call the "smile curve" theory of operations. Internally, we harness global resources to create a world-class design and R&D team, while on the outside, we combine the benefits of direct sales and franchising to bring our products to the consumer. We also have instituted informatization in management and created a fast response supply chain system. Currently, Semir has 4, 300 sales locations throughout China, maintaining a core philosophy of recognizing excellence and mutual benefit. We also recognized the need to be a responsible corporate member of society and give back.

In the future, Semir will continue to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, and make "Semir"and "Balabala" the most vibrant, competitive brands in the youth market.

With the quick growth of China’s economy and China’s more and more integration into the global economy in the past two decades, China’s leisure clothes and garment enterprises achieved a high-speed rise and developed into an imperative competitive force tackling the foreign brands in the Chinese marketplace. Zhejiang Semir Garment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Semir Group”) was founded in 1996 and currently possesses two brands (“Semir”, targeted at 16-25 year olds, providing affordable casual clothing featuring “trend and energy”; Balabala, providing children’s clothing, targeted at 3-12 year old kids in better-off families). Both brands occupy a top status in the Chinese marketplace. However, with the intensified market competition and shifts of new sales channels and price components, new challenges are faced by Semir Group.
