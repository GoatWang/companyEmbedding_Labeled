Profile




A French symbol of elegance and refinement, Aubade has always looked for new technical innovations, discoveries, daring and metamorphosis. 
An expertise and corset-making tradition that have largely contributed to the change in women’s outlook on their femininity.
Aubade is a top-of-the-range lingerie brand, an ode to femininity and its power of seduction. 
Inspired by courteous love, the choice of the name Aubade in itself brings to mind the game of seduction. 
An extremely innovative approach in the 1960s initiated a mini-revolution at a time when lingerie was seen as a functional product first and foremost. 
Aubade was the first brand to look at lingerie as a product for one’s pleasure and that of others, the secret and refined accomplice of eternal femininity.

Testing the physical boundaries together with my team gives me fresh motivation every day. I get to set myself challenges and work on previously unimaginable innovations.

                        Bernhard Hunziker, Flamatt
                    





An essential driver in a smaller organization like ours is a high level of passion and dedication. Our employees are committed and show what can be achieved with collaboration and team spirit. Everyone contributes to our success.

I value the positive corporate culture and my friendly colleagues, who are always willing to support me. As a salesman, I communicate and meet with a wide variety of people. That makes my work interesting and varied.

Our ebeam technology will revolutionize many things – I am convinced of that. I wanted to be a part of this historic development, to go home at night knowing I'd done something that was challenging, interesting and – most importantly – good.
