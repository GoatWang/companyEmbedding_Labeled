                                             Company Snapshot
                                            









                                            
	LS Networks Corporation Limited operates in the Men's and boys' clothing sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares LS Networks Corporation Limited with three other
	apparel stores in Asia:
		
	Liaoning Shidai Wanheng Company Limited
	
		of China
		(2016
	sales of 1.56 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$231.81  million]
		of which 108%
		was Trading),
	
	Collins Company Limited
	
		of Taiwan
		(6.63 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$219.31  million]
		of which 62%
		was Trading), and
	
	Tsukamoto Corporation
	
		which is
		
		based in Japan
		(24.62 billion Japanese Yen [US$223.35  million]
		of which 37%
		was Couture Business).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	LS Networks Corporation Limited reported sales of 487.04 billion Korean Won (US$434.93 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
				sharp
			
			decrease of 39.9%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 810.13 billion Korean Won.
	
		The sales level in 2016 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2011, LS Networks Corporation Limited had sales
		of 454.03 billion Korean Won.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 45.3% decline
		in Distribution, from 380.34 billion Korean Won to 208.16 billion Korean Won.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Brand Segment (down 37.6% to 248.32 billion Korean Won)
				
					and
				Lease Segment (down 5.5% to 35.21 billion Korean Won)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Common Useage (up 3,846.1% to 265.02 million Korean Won)
