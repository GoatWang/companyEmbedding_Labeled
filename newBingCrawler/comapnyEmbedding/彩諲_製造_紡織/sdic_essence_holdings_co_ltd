I recently ordered a book from Research and Markets via their website. Shortly after ordering the book

                         I received a message from the Research and Markets Orders Department stating that payment had not been received for the book. My first thought was credit card fraud. I called Orders Department and was connected immediately with Maria O’Toole. Maria was extremely helpful in resolving the payment question. Maria suggested that since Research and Markets is located in Dublin, Ireland and I am located in Seattle, Washington, my credit card company might have placed a hold on the payment. I checked with my card company and this was indeed the case. I corrected the hold on the payment and informed Maria. Maria confirmed that the payment transaction had been completed and assured me that the book would be delivered in a timely manner. 

I truly appreciate the ease with which I was able to contact a live person quickly and resolve the issue easily. I highly recommend Research and Markets for their depth and breadth of research materials and their excellent customer service.
