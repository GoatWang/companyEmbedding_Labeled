Explains the key terms for anyone studying Health and Social Care in school, college or those working in the health and social care sector. Each entry begins with a clear definition and is followed by explanation that contextualises the concept and applies it to the real world.From active participation to vulnerable adults’ the book provides clear definitions, in-depth descriptions and real world example applications, making the most complicated of terms easy to understand. This is an invaluable reference for students of all health and social care courses, helping familiarise them with the language of health and social care.Perfect for new students as terms and concepts are clearly explained, helping students new to health and social care gain a thorough understanding quickly. A great companion book throughout the course giving the more advanced student full explanations of important and challenging concepts, helping them tackle course assignments with confidence.
