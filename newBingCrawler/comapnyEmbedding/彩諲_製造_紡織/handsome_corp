Currently serves over 60 international brands, this is the first time for the Handsome Corp. selling the local designer’s product.
The “1 TO 10” t-shirt series is designed by Studio Concrete, an artist collaboration group created by Yoo Ah In. Each number printed on the tee represents and expresses the mood of a particular person. For instance, ‘Low 1’, ‘Very Good 10’, ‘Love 9’, ‘Empty 2’ ~everything about joy, sadness, and more. The t-shirts are available in white, black, pink, till up to ten colors. According to Studio Concrete, the concept of this design is inspired by the Marathon tee.

First opened in March 2008, Tom Greyhound (also called The Tom Greyhound Downstairs) is the first international multi-brand concept store which showcases the creative product of the budding designers.

Our Handsome Story
When in 2010 former SSL International UK Marketing Director, Mark Critchley, was looking at a career change, it was more than timely that a contact of his, Adrian Collins from Ziggurat Brands introduced him to Mr John Sutcliffe, a surgeon at The London Spine Clinic.
Old friends who regularly holidayed together, Adrian and John had often discussed, the possibility of bringing effective, but beautifully designed and crafted back care products to market. As fate would have it, Mark was planning to launch a consumer health company and the rest they say, is history.
Nobody else was taking leadership in the back care arena, so the group brought in design and innovation experts, Seymourpowell, to form a company and do just this. In February 2011, they launched Handsome, to reflect the fact its product designs would be both stylish and pleasing on the eye.
In September 2013, Handsome launched the bac< range of back care products, which are now being used in over 50 countries around the world.

Good Back Care Means Good Back Health
Back pain is one of the main reasons for time off work in the UK. 81% of the UK adult population; that’s 40 million people, are currently suffering or have suffered with back pain at some point during their lives.
Back pain is debilitating, many people endure years of chronic back pain that can curtail their lifestyles. At Handsome, we believe that a healthy back is fundamental to a happy life and we want to get people moving again and avoid back pain in the first place. Whether they are currently suffering or have never had back pain before, we want to show that taking care of your back now can make difference later.
We believe that there is a lack of education and confusion at retail point of sale, and that we can provide clear, innovative products to prevent and treat back pain.

Neck Brace
With its revolutionary design, the Neck Brace offers the benefit of a traditional soft neck brace but with improved comfort to wear. Its sleek and streamlined structure is incredibly discreet whilst still providing the support necessary. It works to improve posture as well as providing relief from pain in the neck and upper back.








Dual Action Roller Massager
Our unique Dual Action Roller Massager can help to quickly and easily reduce muscle tension by applying pressure exactly where it’s needed. The product also includes a 20ml sample of our relief gel that can be applied with the Dual Action Roller Massager for additional relief.








Shoulder Brace
Lightweight, discreet and remarkably comfortable to wear, our revolutionary shoulder brace pulls the shoulders back and straightens the spine to instantly improve posture. It’s easy to adjust for a perfect custom fit and its cushioned ‘soft-feel’ spine makes it comfortable for everyday use.








Back Brace with Pads
The Back Brace works by allowing tired muscles to relax while it supports the spine. It’s lightweight, easy to use and comfortable to wear with a contour-fit for maximum support. Special pockets for either our heat or cool pads deliver soothing warmth or cooling relief.








Sacroiliac Belt
Sacroiliac pain (lower back pain) can be particularly debilitating. The Sacroiliac belt is specifically designed to support and compress the hip joints. Discreet and easy to use, the Sacroiliac Belt gives maximum support to the hip and pelvic area, helping to regain natural movement and relieve pain.




Posture Range








Standing Desk
Ideal for use in the home or the office, this versatile desk can be adjusted in a matter of seconds, allowing you to vary your position throughout the day. With no assembly required, the Standing Desk sits on top of your existing work surface, transforming your desk into an ergonomic, sit-stand workstation.








Posture Stand
This remarkably versatile stand provides a simple and affordable way to improve the ergonomics of your workspace. Ideal for raising a computer monitor, laptop or tablet to the natural eye level, this high quality Posture Stand can be configured to suit your needs and can even be used as a portable standing desk.








Backboard™
This simple, adjustable lumbar support helps to maintain a correct sitting position by preventing slumping of the lower back. Its flexible construction allows it to be bent into any position, meaning it can be specifically tailored to fit the curvature of your spine, reducing the stresses and strains that occur from poor posture.








Posture Cushion
This pre-inflated disc works by de-stabilising the sitting surface to encourage active sitting and engage the postural muscles. As your body is required to perform continuous micro-movements to stay balanced, these movements work to strengthen your core muscles which are essential to providing the support needed to maintain a correct posture.








Posture Minder
Using reference images taken from a webcam, this innovative software continually checks your posture throughout the day to provide a friendly reminder whenever it detects static or damaging postures. The software also provides break reminders, a hydration diary as well as stretch exercises to relieve muscle tension.
