E Ink and QuirkLogic Strengthen Partnership to Create New Markets

E Ink Launches Seven New Colors for E Ink Prism Dynamic Color Changing Film for Architecture

E INK ANNOUNCES AND EXHIBITS NEW TECHNOLOGIES AT SID DISPLAY WEEK 2017







Competitiveness



Based on E Ink's outlook for the industry, E Ink will utilize its existing strength and dominant market position to expand into the markets for all TFT-LCD devices.E Ink will utilize TFT-related technologies to develop new products and new applications in order to maintain steady growth in sales and profit.
1. Understanding market needsSince 1992, E Ink has focused on small-and-medium-sized TFT LCD products and established a technology service oriented manufacturing business. Through this long-term investment and focus, the company's accumulated experience is a valuable, irreplaceable resource.
2. Complete product lines and capabilitiesE Ink has a complete production line for small-and-medium-sized TFT LCD products. The company is also actively involved in procuring material resources to ensure long-term stable supply of products. Furthermore, E Ink is always exercising its creativity to manufacture products to meet new market demands, but also to ensure the company's dominance in the market. Key TFT LCD products are up to 12.1 inches wide
3. Going the extra miles for customersThrough its superior customization service, E Ink has successfully established itself in the market. The company provides its main customers in the niche market with benefits which include products that return better profit can enjoy the benefits and security from marketing a unique product over a specified period.
4.Customer relationsE Ink has a culture of developing good relationships between the company and its customers. One of the company's principle customer support strategies is to assign technical staff to help a customer to resolve any product issue encountered. This often enables the customer to go to market before its competitors. The company's quality manufacturing and excellent service gives our customers product advantage.
5. Product development: meeting changing needsDrawing on its expertise in technological development and marketing projects, E Ink maintains an efficient production schedule. However, E Ink aims to shorten the product development process even further. Currently, the time frame for specification development to preparation for mass production averages three or four months for a new product. In the future, E Ink aims to complete the process within three months. Shortening the lead time will cut costs. Keeping product development expenses as low as possible in such a competitive market is one of E Ink's highest priorities, yet E Ink still intends to develop special products to meet demand.
6. Product development at minimal NRE costTo create competitive price advantage, E Ink exercises strict cost control throughout the product development process including the design and testing stages. Strict cost control is even more stringent products developed for clients with special requirements. In the development process, new products cannot be guaranteed to be successful. However, if a new product is price competitive due to tight cost control and minimized expenditure during development, it will have a greater chance of success.

Jim Ratcliffe – A Profile by The Sunday Times
You may not have head of Jim Ratcliffe, but he is in your life from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep. He is responsible for the plastic cap on your toothpaste tube to the chlorine that cleans the water you use to brush your teeth. Many of the things you use during the day that are made using chemicals “we’ve had a hand in,” he says with a smile. This includes our clothes, our car, our furniture, and the packages our food and medicines come in.  Describing Jim as “Britain’s most successful post war industrialist”, John Arlidge asks him about his views on manufacturing, investments, shale gas and his latest project to build an uncompromising 4x4.

Big Boats - A Bold Plan
Whilst European gas production is crumbling, America's is booming. INEOS has a bold, pioneering plan: to ship US ethane gas to Europe bringing competitive advantage from America into Europe.
Five short films document the design and build of highly advanced, sustainable fleet of eight vessels that will be essential in supporting the INEOS plan. They are the largest, most flexible, advanced multigas carriers ever built.
“People said it couldn’t be done. At INEOS we believe everything is possible.” Jim Ratcliffe.
