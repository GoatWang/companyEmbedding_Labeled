Established by Wang Dongxing, Wang Liangxing and Wang Congxing in 1987 Lilanz Group was the first in China to advocate the design concept of “business and leisure” for men’s clothing. After over two decades’ development, it led the way of business men’s clothing industry in China with the integration of design, R&D, production and marketing, and was listed as one of the “Small-Medium Enterprises with Most Potential in China” by Forbes in 2007 and 2008. Now there are brands such as Lilanz and L2 (sub-brand) under the Group.

The design philosophy of “Simple Yet Sophisticated” is also the core value of Lilanz that has been interpreted and displayed in the past over twenty years. To date, Lilanz has changed its design philosophies from “wisdom lies in making comprise” to “less is more”, then to “Infinite World, Infinite Heart”, and finally to “Simple Yet Sophisticated”. In such persistent search, compromise and innovation, Lilanz with typical Chinese wisdom brings businessmen all over the world a new experience with brand value. 

The outstanding brand charm of Lilanz attracts and retains many top designers. Mr. Ji Wenbo, one of the top 10 designers in China and the one winning “Chinese Golden Thimble Award”, joined the Company in 2002, bringing new soul into Lilanz products. His professional designs and international design concepts perfectly explained the brand’s core value of “Simple Yet Sophisticated”. He also led Lilanz to go abroad on behalf of Chinese men’s clothing enterprises for representation in Milan Fashion Week, Taipei Fashion Show and Tokyo Fashion Week, giving brilliant shows in the international fashion field with its perfect interpretation of Chinese elements in fashions.

Lilanz started its globalization strategy in 2008 by changing its trademark LILANG to LILANZ and designing its logo simpler, grander and more international .As Chinese top men’s clothing manufacturer, Lilanz succeeded in going public in Hong Kong and entered the international capital market in 2009, starting the capital upgrading of China's men’s clothing industry. After that, Lilanz enhanced its multi-brand operation and fostered new growth points by promptly exploring the huge market of medium-grade men’s business and leisure clothing with brand L2. In the future, Lilanz will enhance its management, marketing channel and brand strategy, play an active part in the fashion events, participate more frequently in the world-class fashion fairs and strengthen the right to say in the international fashion circle, so as to build its image and establish its position among the fashion circle of the world.Less

PUMA Seires Export type truck scale





1. What is the structure of Puma Series truck scale?
Puma Series is newly developed by our smart engineer accordingly to the most popular structures from Europe. And it keeps the great heritage of our company and European quality standard. We named it Puma, because it is very flexible and robust, with the features of easy mounting and economical transportation cost and so on. It is with special ¡°box¡±for connecting the scale bodies, and thus making everything easier for the European customers.





 




2. Are you still worried about the shipping cost to Europe? Puma will tell you, Never!

Puma Series is using very thick but low U beam structure, and its special design and structure decides that you can put 2 pcs 3X18m Puma series into a 20 feet container. While other companies are still worried about how to put 2 pcs 3X1 8m into a 40 feet container, the freight charge Puma saved for you will allow you to buy another truck scale from China again.

3. Is it very hard to install all the truck scales from China? All need big cranes? Puma says no!

The smart structure of Puma is original from Europe and thus the installation is easy and convenient and saving a lot of Euros on labor cost and cost for hiring big cranes. You can easily install the Puma series truck scales by only a forklift. The position stopper we used for installation the truck scale will let you easily have the position of installing the truck scale. You will never need to turn the truck scale wholly upside and down.








4. You have 3X18m truck scale in stock, but the customer needs a 3X16m truck scale tomorrow. What can you do? To buy another one from China tomorrow? Puma will solve this for you.

Puma series truck scale is manufactured by moulds. This means all scale body will be able to match to any others, so it will be much easier for the customers to stock the truck scales. You don¡¯t need to stock 3X1 8m truck scale or 3X1 6m truck scale, for option you need only to stock the scale body 3.5m, 4.5m and 5.5m long and stock some ¡°box ¡±which is normally 0.35m long, and thus you can match to any truck scale sizes you need. But be careful of the Max. Capacity, only similar capacity scale bodies can match together.

5. Are you still looking for portable truck scales from China? Nobody can supply that? You missed Lilascale and our Puma series.

As Puma series from Lilascale is structured with special¡°box¡±structure and the load cell is installed in this box. We can easily place a 20mm thick plates under the load cell, thereafter no foundation will be needed. Of course this portable truck scale should be placed on thick concrete road floor. After used for a while, you can easily move it to another place for short time use again.

6. Do you think the labor cost for installing a weighbridge in your country is too expensive? Let Lilascale and our Puma series truck scale do this for you.
If you buy the plates under the load cell from us, we will be able to install the load cells in our factory. This will save a lot of your labor in your country, as you only need to bolt the scale body and calibrate. There is no need for your worker to install the load cells and do the lightening protection wire, all these will be done in Lilascale. Stoppers are done in Lilascale factory too.
