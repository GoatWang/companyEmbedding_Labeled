(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward Looking Statements  Some of the statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" which can be identified by the use of terminology such as "estimates," "projects," "plans," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," or the negative or other variations, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We urge you to be cautious of the forward-looking statements, that such statements, which are contained in this Form 10-K, reflect our current beliefs with respect to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors affecting our operations, market growth, services, products, and licenses. No assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future results, as actual results may differ materially as a result of the risks we face, and actual events may differ from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made regarding anticipated events. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without limitation:  1. Our ability to attract and retain management and key employees;  2. Our ability to generate customer demand for our products;  3. The intensity of competition; and  4. General economic conditions.  Table of Contents  All written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this annual report that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given the uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $266,031 for the period from inception (June 10, 2014) to December 31, 2016. The Company has not generated revenue, as the business operations have been focused on developing our business plan and market research, this raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Overview  The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following information specifies forward looking statements that anticipate our business plan, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contemplated in those forward looking statements.  Description of Business  General Information  We have yet to commence planned operations to any significant measure. As of the date of this annual report, we, have had only limited start-up operations and have not generated revenues. We will not be profitable until we derive sufficient revenues and cash flows from sales of silicon energy clothing products. Our administrative office is located at 4F, No. 132, Songshan Rd., Xinyi District, Taipei City, 110, Taiwan (Republic of China).  Our fiscal year ends on is December 31.  As of the date of this annual report, we have not sold any silicon energy clothing nor have we generated any revenue from operations.  We are a development stage company located in Taipei City, Taiwan. We plan to market and distribute in Taiwan silica energy clothing manufactured by Shinin Silica Corp., a Taiwanese corporation ("Shinin"). Generally, that clothing consists of men's and women's undergarments and related apparel. That clothing is made from an energy silicon fiber and yarn made from a fine nanoscale silicon powder and polymer materials which, together, result in a reactive energy material. Additionally, that clothing is bio-degradable and quick-drying.  We believe that we will be successful in selling high quality silica energy clothing products at economical prices because we plan to buy the product directly from Shinin at discounted prices. We plan to enter into agreements with clothing product suppliers and retailers in Taiwan, such as specialty stores and department stores. By moving those silica energy clothing products directly from Shinin to the supplier and/or retailer, we are able to avoid the costs and fees associated with housing and storing those silica energy clothing products, which will result in more profit for us and better prices for our customers.  Table of Contents  Our sole officer and director, Hsuan-Hsien Liao, has experience in the silica energy clothing product industry, she possesses strong sales and management experience and these skills are a valuable asset to the Company. We plan to contact and begin negotiating agreements with potential customers by entering into purchase agreements with suppliers and retailers of clothing products.  Going Concern  The Company has incurred losses to date. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  For the period ended December 31, 2016, the Company had limited operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not emerged from the development stage. In view of these matters, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its planned business. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from a loan commitment of $100,000 from Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our president and sole director, which commitment is for 12 months, and all amounts lent by Ms. Liao pursuant to that commitment shall not accrue interest and shall be payable on demand; provided however, such demand will not be made prior to the expiration of that 12 month period after the date of that commitment, which date is March 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the amount owed to Ms. Liao pursuant to that commitment was $0. That funding commitment will terminate on March 31, 2017. Ms. Liao has extended that commitment for an additional 12-month period, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $266,031 for the period from inception (June 10, 2014) to December 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.  Net Income (loss) per Share  Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. At December 31, 2016, the Company does not have any outstanding common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented.  Table of Contents  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations, financial position or cash flow.  Results of Operations  The following presents the results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses have increased by $64,979 to $64,989 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $10 for year ended December 31, 2015.  Loss from Operations. Loss from operations for the year ended December 31 2016, was $(64,989), compared to $(10) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Other Income (expenses). Other income (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $56, compared to $1 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $(64,933), compared to $(9) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash from financing activities. Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016, were $50,150, compared to $3,369 at December 31, 2015.  Net cash flow from operating activities was $(64,937) during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $(9) during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, is a result of our net loss of $(64,933), compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in the net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss incurred during that year ended December 31, 2016. The increases in other receivables and prepaid expenses and the decrease in accrued expenses were partially offset by the increase in the amount due to related parties for working capital purposes.  Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $111,718 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash flow provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, was from the sale of our common stock.  Table of Contents  Capital Expenditures  Total capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were $0 and $0, respectively.  Inflation  Our opinion is that inflation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our operations.  Climate Change  Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.  Mar 29, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Haha Generation's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

There are many barriers of entry in the clothing market, and the level of competition 
is extremely high. Examples of barriers of entry in this market include brand 
loyalty, aggressive lower pricing tactics, and economies of scale. Many of our 
established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our 
potential customers prefer their clothing products to Shinin’s. Aggressive 
lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for 
us to enter and compete in this market. Economies of scale make it easier for 
our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers 
of clothing products, which would leave us at a disadvantage.

The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality 
of our products. We will be in a market where we will be in direct competition 
with many domestic and international companies offering competing products. Many 
large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential 
customers. Many of these companies may have a greater and more established customer 
base than us. We will likely lose prospective business to such companies. Also, 
many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for competing 
products than us, which may also cause us to lose prospective business. We also 
foresee challenges facing new market entrants. We may be unable to compete effectively 
with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations.

We have not yet entered the market. Once we enter the market, we will be one of 
many participants in the business of distributing clothing products. Many established 
and well-financed entities are currently active in the business of distributing 
such products. Nearly all of our competitors have significantly greater financial 
resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than us. We are, consequently, 
at a competitive disadvantage in the market. Therefore, we may not be able to 
establish ourselves within the industry.

Key FeaturesMake the history & innovation industrial revolution
21 st century latest innovation
Electric Vehicle, electric tricycle,
electric auto rechargeable power generation system.
/Advantages
Extend the endurance
Creation of convertible kinetic energy into electrical power system
1.	Kinetic energy concept advocated zero pollution
2.	Main Concept －-“Electric Vehicle Auto Rechargeable Power Generation System” Extend the endurance
Basic accessories can extend the endurance of electric vehicles.

3.	The research of “Electric Vehicle Auto Rechargeable Power Generation System”means that when the electric vehicle is in the motion how to retrieve and transform the kinetic energy to the electronic power within the car.
1.	The electric vehicle has a 80 horsepower motor with a maximum speed of 150KM/HR.
2.	Each electric vehicle equipped with two sets of lithium iron battery (A)25AAnn and battery (B)25AAnn.
When the electric vehicle is in the motion it is first supply by the Battery (A) and when Battery (A) is dropped to 40% of its electric energy the system will automatically switch to Battery (B).At the same time	,all electric generators will recharge allocation of 6 in the group of 10 sets of electric powers (60%) of Battery (A).
3.	The 2 sets of elliptical tires both in the middle and the back will produce fixed vibration frequency while the car is in the motion. This vibration frequency can produce kinetic energy and will be transforming to the electric energy and continuous the recycle of the electric energy.
4.	Tire pressure generator:By using two sets of built-in interior sliding axis’s elasticity to activate the electric generator.When the electric vehicle is in the motion,the tires’ contact point to the road has the most pressure. By using this pressure to activate the electric generator to produce electricity and continues electricity cycle.
5.	The only way to resolve the environmental problem of global warming is to use electric car and electric auto rechargeable power generation and it is Pollution Free.

NOTE 1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting
and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, the unaudited financial statements contained in this
report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in
nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and the results of operations for the interim
periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from
audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures
required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period
are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full
year. These unaudited financial statements, footnote disclosures,
and other information should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

“Company”), was incorporated on June 10, 2014 in the
State of Nevada. The Company has conducted limited business
operations and had no revenues from operations since its inception.

These
financial statements were prepared on the basis of accounting
principles applicable to going concern, which assumes the
realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial
statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $252,848 and
$201,098 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and it had no revenue from operations.

 

The
Company faces all the risks common to companies at development
stage, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources,
high initial expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams, and
difficulties in managing growth. The Company's losses raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company's financial statements do not reflect any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

The
Company intends on financing its future development activities and
its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity
securities with some additional funding from a loan commitment of
$100,000 from Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our President and sole director,
which commitment is for 12 months, and all amounts lent by Ms. Liao
pursuant to that commitment shall not accrue interest and shall be
payable on demand; provided however, such command will not be made
prior to the expiration of that 12 month period after the date of
that commitment, which date was March 31, 2016.

The
Company believes its current and future plans enable it to continue
as a going concern. The Company's ability to achieve these
objectives cannot be determined at this time. These financial
statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of
business and at amounts which may differ from those in the
accompanying financial statements.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments
with original maturities of three months or less.

 

Net
Income (loss) per Share

 

Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted income per share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during each period. At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any outstanding
common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate computation of
diluted loss per share is not presented

 

Income
Taxes

 

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if
it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred
tax asset will not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were
$0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 

Reclassifications

 

Certain
classifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation. The
reclassification had no impact on previously reported net loss or
accumulated deficit.

Forward Looking Statements
Some of the statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not historical facts
are "forward-looking statements" which can be identified by the use of
terminology such as "estimates," "projects," "plans," "believes," "expects,"
"anticipates," "intends," or the negative or other variations, or by discussions
of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We urge you to be cautious of
the forward-looking statements, that such statements, which are contained in
this Form 10-K, reflect our current beliefs with respect to future events and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors affecting our
operations, market growth, services, products, and licenses. No assurances can
be given regarding the achievement of future results, as actual results may
differ materially as a result of the risks we face, and actual events may differ
from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made regarding
anticipated events. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or
achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated
by such forward-looking statements include without limitation:
1. Our ability to attract and retain management and key employees;
2. Our ability to generate customer demand for our products;
3. The intensity of competition; and
4. General economic conditions.

All written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this
annual report that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given the
uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company
will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial
statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $266,031 for the
period from inception (June 10, 2014) to December 31, 2016. The Company has not
generated revenue, as the business operations have been focused on developing
our business plan and market research, this raises substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.



 Overview



The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
The following information specifies forward looking statements that anticipate
our business plan, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those contemplated in those forward looking statements.



Description of Business



General Information



We have yet to commence planned operations to any significant measure. As of the
date of this annual report, we, have had only limited start-up operations and
have not generated revenues. We will not be profitable until we derive
sufficient revenues and cash flows from sales of silicon energy clothing
products. Our administrative office is located at 4F, No. 132, Songshan Rd.,
Xinyi District, Taipei City, 110, Taiwan (Republic of China).
Our fiscal year ends on is December 31.
As of the date of this annual report, we have not sold any silicon energy
clothing nor have we generated any revenue from operations.
We are a development stage company located in Taipei City, Taiwan. We plan to
market and distribute in Taiwan silica energy clothing manufactured by Shinin
Silica Corp., a Taiwanese corporation ("Shinin"). Generally, that clothing
consists of men's and women's undergarments and related apparel. That clothing
is made from an energy silicon fiber and yarn made from a fine nanoscale silicon
powder and polymer materials which, together, result in a reactive energy
material. Additionally, that clothing is bio-degradable and quick-drying.
We believe that we will be successful in selling high quality silica energy
clothing products at economical prices because we plan to buy the product
directly from Shinin at discounted prices. We plan to enter into agreements with
clothing product suppliers and retailers in Taiwan, such as specialty stores and
department stores. By moving those silica energy clothing products directly from
Shinin to the supplier and/or retailer, we are able to avoid the costs and fees
associated with housing and storing those silica energy clothing products, which
will result in more profit for us and better prices for our customers.

  Table of Contents




Our sole officer and director, Hsuan-Hsien Liao, has experience in the silica
energy clothing product industry, she possesses strong sales and management
experience and these skills are a valuable asset to the Company. We plan to
contact and begin negotiating agreements with potential customers by entering
into purchase agreements with suppliers and retailers of clothing products.



Going Concern



The Company has incurred losses to date. The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
For the period ended December 31, 2016, the Company had limited operations. As
of December 31, 2016, the Company has not emerged from the development stage. In
view of these matters, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable
operations from the development of its planned business. The Company intends on
financing its future development activities and its working capital needs
largely from the sale of equity securities with some additional funding from a
loan commitment of $100,000 from Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our president and sole
director, which commitment is for 12 months, and all amounts lent by Ms. Liao
pursuant to that commitment shall not accrue interest and shall be payable on
demand; provided however, such demand will not be made prior to the expiration
of that 12 month period after the date of that commitment, which date is March
31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the amount owed to Ms. Liao pursuant to that
commitment was $0. That funding commitment will terminate on March 31, 2017. Ms.
Liao has extended that commitment for an additional 12-month period, on the same
terms and subject to the same conditions. The financial statements of the
Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company
has incurred an accumulated deficit of $266,031 for the period from inception
(June 10, 2014) to December 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Cash and Cash Equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.
Net Income (loss) per Share
Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted
income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during each period. At December 31, 2016, the Company
does not have any outstanding common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate
computation of diluted loss per share is not presented.

Income Taxes



The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes,
which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets
based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in
the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit
(expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax
liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations,
financial position or cash flow.



Results of Operations



The following presents the results of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses have
increased by $64,979 to $64,989 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $10
for year ended December 31, 2015.
Loss from Operations. Loss from operations for the year ended December 31 2016,
was $(64,989), compared to $(10) for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other Income (expenses). Other income (expenses) for the year ended December 31,
2016, was $56, compared to $1 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $(64,933), compared
to $(9) for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash from
financing activities. Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016, were
$50,150, compared to $3,369 at December 31, 2015.
Net cash flow from operating activities was $(64,937) during the year ended
December 31, 2016, compared to $(9) during the year ended December 31, 2015. The
decrease in net cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December
31, 2016, is a result of our net loss of $(64,933), compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. The change in the net cash used in operating activities was
primarily attributable to net loss incurred during that year ended December 31,
2016. The increases in other receivables and prepaid expenses and the decrease
in accrued expenses were partially offset by the increase in the amount due to
related parties for working capital purposes.
Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $111,718 for the year ended
December 31, 2016, compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
cash flow provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016,
was from the sale of our common stock.
