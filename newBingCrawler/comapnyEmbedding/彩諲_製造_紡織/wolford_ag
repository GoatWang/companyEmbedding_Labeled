Sharper product line and collection 
Wolford plans to adjust the structure of the product line and collection statement to better reflect the expectations of customers in the future. This strategic refocussing is based on the results of market surveys as well as an extensive analysis of the product line. The focus will therefore shift to the company’s core expertise of Legwear as the “DNA of the brand“ and figure-embracing complementary products, with an expanded offering of (figure-shaping) Lingerie and Underpinnings (bodys, tops, shirts, etc.). The Ready-to-wear line will concentrate on products that fit with this more precise positioning. The Swimwear product group will be discontinued beginning with the 2015 spring/summer collection. The remaining elements in the collection will continue to underscore the fashionable-esthetic demands, high functionality, uncompromising quality approach and the unrivaled wearing comfort that distinguish the Wolford brand.

Our
partnership with bluesign technologies is something that we take very serious at Wolford. With more
than 70% of our production based in Austria, we link the high-quality product
technology of the region by localizing our headquarters in Bregenz. Closely
aligning natural resources with our brand, we operate in a natural water
reserve and meet the very high levels of criteria defined by the bluesign® system. Within
every process, we create essential products which are labeled as very
responsible. From the
very first fibers we create, we aim to develop our products into long-lasting
items that promote our functionality as a brand. We are
always searching to create new innovations of fabrics and products, and are
taking a strong push towards our sustainability for the future. Safe
textiles, practicing eco-friendly production, and carefully using resources are
qualities that we represent. The
long-term, sustainability of our company is a continuous process worked on in a
collaborative setting with our business partners. Our aim is to meticulously
cover areas including economic, social, and ecological responsibilities. We
work to include sustainable aspects within both technical processes and
personal interactions.
We are
proud to be a bluesign® system partner.
