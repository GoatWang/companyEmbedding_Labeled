Knowledge of the German language in Denmark, 2005. According to the Eurobarometer,[1] 58% of the respondents indicated that they know German well enough to have a conversation. Of these 15% (per cent, not percentage points) reported a very good knowledge of the language whereas 33% had a good knowledge and 52% basic German skills.


The Kingdom of Denmark has only one official language,[3] Danish, the national language of the Danish people, but there are several minority languages spoken through the territory. These include German, Faroese, and Greenlandic.

A large majority (86%)[1] of Danes also speak English as a second language; it is mandatory for Danish students to learn from the first grade in Folkeskole. In the fifth grade of Folkeskole, a third language option is given, usually German or French. The vast majority pick German (47% of Danes report being able to speak conversational German). The third most widely understood language is Swedish, with 13% of Danes reporting to be able to speak it. [4]

Official regional languages[edit]
German[edit]
German is an official minority language in the former South Jutland County (part of what is now the Region of Southern Denmark), which was part of Imperial Germany prior the Treaty of Versailles.[2] Between 15,000 and 20,000 Ethnic Germans live in South Jutland, of whom roughly 8,000 use either the standard German or the Schleswigsch variety of Low Saxon in daily communications. Schleswigisch is highly divergent from Standard German and can be quite difficult to understand by Standard German speakers. Outside of South Jutland, the members of St. Peter's Church in Copenhagen use German in their Church, its website, and the school that it runs.[5]
The German minority operates its own system of primary schools with German as the primary language of instruction as well as a system of libraries throughout South Jutland. It also operates a German high school located in Aabenraa (German: Apenrade).
Beside this there are also 28,584 immigrants from Germany in Denmark by 2012.[6]
Faroese[edit]




Faroese-language postage stamps.


Faroese, a North Germanic language like Danish, is the primary language of the Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory of the Kingdom. It is also spoken by some Faroese immigrants to mainland Denmark. Faroese is similar to Icelandic, and also the Old Norse language spoken in the Scandinavian area more than a millennium ago.
Greenlandic[edit]
Greenlandic is the main language of the 54,000 Inuit living in Greenland, which is, like the Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory of Denmark. Roughly 7,000 people speak Greenlandic on the Danish mainland.

My favorite product is the Ultimate Face + Neck Moisturiser.  I thought it smelled so lovely, soft, and felt like velvet going on my skin.  It made my face feel like silk.  I value that it is also for our neck and decollete' area, as sun damage occurs there on most on women, and I love stopping time!

I really love sharing the product and the opportunity.  It's not about the money for me, but it is about sharing the products.

I love all the products! But one of the first things I purchased was the Reveal Enzyme Peel. It's probably my favorite because I see the most immediate and drastic results. I love watching that dead skin come off! It really reaffirms that I am doing such a great job of taking care of my skin.

I am excited to move to the next level in the career plan, which then would bring a bigger pay check.  It will also give me the opportunity to spend more time with my kids.

I am very excited for the future of become.  This product has been the best kept secret from Australia for quite some time and I can't wait for the entire world to know about become Beauty.  These products work!  The business model is set up so you cannot fail!  You have the choice to do your business however you want, from enjoying a Membership for your personal use to selling it and earning an income, to growing it and building a fabulous team of men and women in a positive environment that encourages long term friendships!  2015 for me is looking forward to having the flexibility to be with my son and make sure he has 100% healing and having the funds to keep up with the medical bills that are flowing in! :)

My favorite product is the one I can not live without...ULTIMATE!!! First of all, it makes my skin feel so good and allows my to apply my foundation with ease.  It has changed my skin.  Lines that I used to have on my cheeks and neck are gone.  It is worth every penny and really is a value since it lasts a long time and you only use a little.  Also, I have found that it heals things on my skin...small cuts or bug bites.  I get shingles once in a while on my neck from stress and if you have ever had shingles, you know you can feel a burning sensation right before it breaks through the surface.  If I apply Ultimate to the area when I first get that feeling, I usually avoid the out break.

It's so easy to share because the products speak for themselves.  It's a consumable product, so people keep coming back year after year.

I love how the product work and how easy it is to use.  It feels so light!  When I had an allergic reaction this fall to something in the environment, I broke out everywhere, but my face remained clear.  This is a great testament to how natural the product is.

Two of the most widely followed apparel makers saw their stocks collapse in dramatic fashion over the past year. But quietly, away from the spotlight, several peer stocks broke out to the upside last month. Others appear ready to follow soon. The big losers included sports-apparel maker Under Armour (ticker: UAA), which fell from roughly $54 per share in 2015 to its low near $17 earlier this year. The decline included several multi-percentage-point single-day drops along the way. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) also suffered...

CAI International, Inc. (CAI) is seeing excellent follow-through from last Friday, when price popped all the way up to a high of $26.12. On Monday the stock gained $1.00, or 3.8%, to close at a three-year high of $26.93 on 427,600 shares traded. Analysts have dramatically increased earnings expectations for the transportation finance and logistics company in recent weeks, and earnings will be announced on Wednesday (July 26) after the close. The stock is being traded at some of the heaviest volume this year. Having already blown through significant resistance in the $25-$26 zone, price could easily reach $30 in the near term. The price channel shows that this could be a $40 stock or more in the longer term.
ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN) snapped back Monday, up $6.34, up 68 cents, or 12%, on 4.3 million shares traded.  The stock bounced off the bottom of its rising channel as well as its 50-day moving average after having pulled back from its channel top in the last three weeks. The move came on no apparent news, although the company announces 2Q earnings this coming Friday morning. With continued momentum, price could move up to $8-$10 in the next few weeks.
Impex Laboratories Inc (IPXL) is on the move, having recently broken out of a head-and-shoulders bottoming pattern.  The stock closed at $18.75, up 60 cents, or 3.3%, on 1.5 million shares traded and no news, and is now up more than 40% off its mid-June low of $13.25.  The stock saw large gains last week with news of FDA approval of a generic version of its ADHD drug, Concerta, and expected product launch by the end of 2017. The company is expected to report earnings on August 8 before market open.  The next target range is $20-$23.
Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (KRO) broke out of its bull wedge consolidation pattern, gaining 54 cents, or 2.6%, on 456,000 shares traded Monday. Price for the chemicals manufacturing stock has not been up at this level in about five years. Watch the spike high price from July 12 at $21.10. If price moves through that level, targets going forward are $23.50 and $25.

The culture of Denmark has a rich intellectual and artistic heritage. The astronomical discoveries of Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Ludwig A. Colding's (1815–1888) neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the foundational contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962); in this century Lene Vestergaard Hau (born 1959) in quantum physics involving the stopping of light, advances in nano-technology, and contributions to the understanding of Bose-Einstein Condensates, demonstrate the range and endurance of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the short stories of Karen Blixen, penname Isak Dinesen, (1885–1962), the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), modern authors such as Herman Bang and Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein (1905–1996), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars Von Trier. Denmark has had a strong tradition of movie making and Carl Theodor Dreyer has been recognised as one of the world's greatest film directors.[1]
Culture and the arts thrive as a result of the proportionately[clarification needed] high amount of government funding they receive, much of which is administered by local authorities so as to involve citizens directly.[2] Thanks to a system of grants, Danish artists are able to devote themselves to their work while museums, theatres, and the film institute receive national support.[3]
Copenhagen, the capital, is home to many famous sites and attractions, including Tivoli Gardens, Amalienborg Palace (home of the Danish monarchy), Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen Cathedral, Rosenborg Castle, Opera House, Frederik's Church (Marble Church), Thorvaldsens Museum, Rundetårn, Nyhavn and the Little Mermaid sculpture.[4]

Hygge[edit]
Similar to other Scandinavian cultures, a fundamental aspect of Danish culture is "hygge". Hygge, meaning 'snug'; is a concept that evokes "coziness", particularly when relaxing with good friends or loved ones and while enjoying good food. Christmas time is a true moment of hygge, as is grilling a pølse (Danish sausage) and drinking a beer on a long summer evening.[5][dubious – discuss] It is suspected the concept of Hygge is part of the reason Danes and other Scandinavians score high on happiness.[6]
Danish Christmas[edit]
Main article: Jul (Denmark)




Viggo Johansen: Happy Christmas (1891)


The Danish word for the Christmas holiday is Jul, from the Old Norse jól, the term for "midwinter", itself cognate with the English word, yule.[7] Midwinter celebrations were an important part of Scandinavian culture since prehistoric times, and the term was retained to refer to "Christmas" after Christianization.[8] In many countries Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December, but in Denmark, and in the other Scandinavian countries, the most important day for celebrations is Christmas Eve on the 24th when the family comes together. The morning can be spent in various ways but most often it is the time when preparations are made for the evening.[9]
Juleaften (Danish for Christmas Eve) or Yule Eve starts around 6 p.m. when a traditional dinner (Julemiddag) is served. The menu is:

White and browned potatoes, red cabbage and brown sauce (gravy) accompanying one or more of: roast duck or goose, a special Danish version of roast pork called flæskesteg complete with crackling or maybe a special sausage called medisterpølse. "White potatoes" are ordinary boiled potatoes without their jackets and "browned potatoes" are caramelised white potatoes.
For dessert, Ris á la mande is served. Made out of rice, it is not to be confused with rice pudding. The chief difference is the whipped cream added to the rice. On serving, chopped almond and vanilla can be added, among other things. It is served cold, with hot cherry sauce. An unchopped almond can also be added and hidden in the dessert. The person who finds it in his portion receives a small prize.

Afterwards, the candles on the Christmas tree are lit and the family dance around it singing Christmas songs and carols and subsequently exchange presents.[9]
Folklore[edit]
Main article: Danish folklore




Frederik Christian Lund: Girl from Skovshoved


Danish folklore is made up of folk tales, legends, songs, music, dancing, popular beliefs and traditions, mostly communicated by the inhabitants of towns and villages across the country. Many of these were passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth. As in neighbouring countries, interest in folklore grew with an emerging feeling of national consciousness in 19th-century Denmark. Researchers travelled across the country collecting innumerable folktales, songs and sayings while observing traditional dress in the various regions. Folklore today is part of the national heritage, represented in particular by national and local traditions, songs, folk dances and literature.
Today's folk dancing in Denmark dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, when there was renewed interest in the national heritage. A number of groups began to revive the music, dances and costumes of past generations. In 1901, the Society for the Promotion of Danish Folk Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme) was founded in Copenhagen, leading to local dancing societies throughout the country.[10] Today there are more than 12,000 folk dancers in 219 local clubs, providing courses in music, dancing and dressmaking.[11][12]
The traditional costumes of Denmark, though varying from region to region, date back roughly to the period between 1750 and 1900 when clothes were often home-made from yarn spun from wool or flax. In rural communities, the fabrication of garments for both family members and servants was an important part of everyday life. The artist Frederik Christian Lund, who had travelled across Denmark as a soldier in the First Schleswig War, took an interest in sketching people in local costumes in various parts of the country. He completed his collection of 31 coloured sketches in 1864, publishing them as coloured lithographs in Danske Nationaldragter (Danish National Costumes).[13]
Numerous Danish folktales contain a range of mythical figures such as trolls, elves, goblins and wights as well as figures from Nordic mythology like giants and lygtemænd (hobby lanterns). The nisse is a particularly well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be helpful if treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.[14][15]
Cuisine[edit]
Main article: Danish cuisine




Smørrebrød (Open sandwich), Left: Roast beef with remoulade, grated horseradish and tomato on Danish rye bread. Right: Egg, prawns, lemon and mayonnaise on white bread.


Perhaps the most typically Danish contribution to the meals of the day is the traditional lunch or smørrebrød consisting of open sandwiches, usually on thinly sliced rugbrød. The meal usually begins with fish such as marinated herring, smoked eel, crab, or breaded plaice filets with remoulade and moves on with slices of roast pork or beef, frikadeller (meatballs), hams and liver pâté. The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade and mayonnaise.[16] The meal is often accompanied by beer, sometimes also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.
In the evening, hot meals are usually served. Traditional dishes include fried fish, roast pork with red cabbage (perhaps the national dish), pot-roasted chicken, or pork chops. Game is sometimes served in the autumn. Steaks are now becoming increasingly popular.
A popular traditional Danish dessert, especially around Christmas, consists of æbleskiver, rather like small pancake doughnuts which are fried in butter in a special pan and are served hot with jam and sugar. Traditionally, they were made with small pieces of apple in the middle which is why they are called æbleskiver, literally "apple slices".
In recent years, development of the New Danish cuisine based on the rediscovery of local ingredients presented in interesting new recipes has led to a significant number of new, highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces, several with Michelin stars. This in turn has led to new developments in food production with a series of new products based on organic farming.[17]
Sports[edit]
Main article: Sports in Denmark
Sports are popular in Denmark, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. The national sport is football (soccer), with the most notable results being qualifying for the European Championships six times in a row (1984–2004) and winning the Championship in 1992. Other significant achievements include winning the Confederations Cup in 1995 and reaching the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup.
Denmark's numerous beaches and resorts are popular locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking and a broad-range of other water-themed sports.
In speedway racing Denmark has won several world championships, including the Speedway World Cup in 2006 and 2008. Other popular sports include golf, mostly popular among the older demographic;[18] tennis, in which Denmark is successful on a professional level; Danish Rugby Union, which dates back to 1950;[19] and indoor sports such as badminton, handball and various forms of gymnastics.
As of January 2012[update], the national handball team are the current reigning European champions and the team with most medals won in European championship history on the men's side with a total of five medals, those being two gold medals (2008, 2012), and three bronze medals (2002, 2004 & 2006). And in 2016 Denmark's handball team won the gold medal for men at the olympics in Rio.
Cycling[edit]

Main article: Cycling in Denmark
In recent years, Denmark has made a mark as a strong cycling nation, with Bjarne Riis winning Tour de France in 1996, and Michael Rasmussen reaching King of the Mountains status, in the Tour 2005 and 2006.
Most Danes are active cyclists, often using their bikes to commute to work or to go off on trips at the weekend. With its well-engineered cycle paths, Copenhagen is especially suited to city cycling. Every day 1.3 million km are cycled in the city,[20] with 36% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle.[21] Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and often quicker way around town than by public transport or car and it is therefore municipal policy for the number of commuters by bike to go up to 40% by 2012 and 50% by 2015.[22]
Odense has been named the "bicycle city of the year" because of the great number of bicycle lanes in the city. A complete network of 350 km all-weather serviced lanes exists in the town.[23]
During the summer months, there are free "City Bikes" stationed at various spots in the downtown area of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg. The idea is that anyone can take a bike from one of the spots, ride it to one of the other spots and leave it there for the next person. There are lots of National and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities.
Fine arts[edit]
Painting[edit]




Frederiksborg Castle by Christen Købke, 1836


Main article: Danish art
Danish painting goes back hundreds of years. Earlier work is often manifested in churches, for example in the form of frescos such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the Elmelunde Master. But it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged with a marked increase in truly Danish art inspired by the country itself with its lifestyle and traditions. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was an important influence on the following generation’s study of nature, in which landscape painting came to the fore. He had many successful students, including Wilhelm Bendz (1804–1832), Christen Købke (1810–48), Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848), Constantin Hansen (1804–1880), Jørgen Roed (1808–1888), Wilhelm Marstrand (1810–1873), C. A. Jensen (1792–1870), J. Th. Lundbye (1818–1848), and P. C. Skovgaard (1817–1875).[24]
Some years later, a number of painters including P. S. Krøyer (1851–1909) and Michael (1849–1927) and Anna Ancher (1859–1935) moved to Skagen in the far north of Jylland to paint the natural surroundings and local people. In due course, the town developed into an artists' colony. A little later, a similar phenomenon developed on Fyn with artists such as Johannes Larsen (1867–1961). Vilhelm Hammershøi is an important painter too.
Collections of modern art enjoy unusually attractive settings at the Louisiana Museum north of Copenhagen, at the North Jylland Art Museum in Aalborg and at the ARoS art museum in Aarhus. The National Museum of Art and the Glyptotek, both in Copenhagen, contain treasures of Danish and international art.
Sculpture[edit]

Main article: Danish sculpture
Danish sculpture as a nationally recognized art form can be traced back to 1752 when Jacques Saly was commissioned to execute King Frederick V of Denmark while on horseback. While Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1844) was undoubtedly the country's most prominent contributor of his time, many other sculptors also produced notable works in the areas of Neoclassicism, Realism, and Historicism, the latter resulting from a growing consciousness of a national identity. From modern times, many notable works of Surrealism and Modernism has been produced, inspired by European trends, especially those from Paris. Present notable Danish sculptors includes Michael Kvium, Hein Heinsen and Bjørn Nørgaard, but the field holds many skilled practitioners and the styles has diversified greatly.
Literature[edit]

Hans Christian Andersen


The principal contributors to Danish literature are undoubtedly Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), storyteller Karen Blixen (1885–1962), playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), and modern authors such as Henrik Pontoppidan and Herman Bang.
Among today's Danish writers, probably the best-known to international readers is Peter Høeg (Smilla's Sense of Snow; Borderliners). Benny Andersen writes poems, short stories, and music. Poems by both writers have been translated into English by the Curbstone Press. Klaus Rifbjerg has published over 100 novels as well as poetry, short stories and TV plays. Two of his works have been translated into English: Witness to the Future and War. Kirsten Thorup's novel Baby, winner of the 1980 Pegasus Prize, is published in English by the University of Louisiana Press. The psychological thrillers of Anders Bodelsen also appear in English as do some of the novels of intrigue by Leif Davidsen. Suzanne Brøgger and Vita Andersen focus largely on the changing roles of women in society.
Architecture[edit]

Grundtvig's Church, Copenhagen


The architecture of Denmark has its origins in the Viking age but became recognizable in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. Inspired by French castles and with the assistance of Dutch designers, architecture during the Renaissance flourished with magnificent royal palaces. Neoclassicism came to Denmark from France and, in the 19th century, slowly merged into the National Romantic style when Danish designers came into their own. It was, however, not until the last half of the 20th century that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class designers such as Johann Otto von Spreckelsen who designed the Grande Arche in Paris. Internationally, perhaps the most celebrated of all is the architect who designed the iconic Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon, but within Danish borders, it is the architect Arne Jacobsen who is perhaps held in highest esteem for developing the 'Danish Modern' style and furniture/interior design, such as the now world-famous and much sought-after Swan and Egg chairs.[25] A new wave of young Danish architects are rising into international prominence, like Bjarke Ingels with works such as the Danish National Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 Expo.
Photography[edit]

Photography in Denmark has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art in 1839 to some of the strongest contemporary photography in Europe today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century while both artistic and press photographers have since made internationally recognised contributions. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.[26]
Design[edit]

Main article: Danish design
Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards.
The Danish Porcelain Factory ("Royal Copenhagen"), including Bing & Grøndahl, is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen (1914–1972), Finn Juhl (1912–1989), Hans Wegner (1914–2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902–1971), Poul Kjærholm (1929–1980), Poul Henningsen (1894–1967) and Verner Panton (1926–1998).[27] Georg Jensen (1866–1935) is known the world over for modern design in silver.
Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Harald Quistgaard (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements and Ole Wanscher (1903–1985) who had a classical approach to furniture design.
The Danish Museum of Art & Design in Copenhagen exhibits the best in Danish design.
Performing arts[edit]
Music[edit]
Main article: Music of Denmark




Carl Nielsen (1865–1931)


Denmark's most famous composer of classical music is Carl Nielsen who is best known outside of Denmark for his six symphonies, but whose melodies for popular songs are cherished among Danes. Other well-known pieces of his are the incidental music for Adam Oehlenschläger's drama Aladdin (Nielsen), the operas Saul og David and Maskarade, the concertos for flute, violin, and clarinet, the Wind Quintet, and the Helios Overture, which depicts the passage of the sun in the sky from dawn to nightfall. The Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of Danish choreographer August Bournonville (1805–79). Hans Abrahamsen, Per Nørgård and Poul Ruders are successful composers of contemporary classical music. Danish interest in classical music is exemplified by the prestigious Opera House completed in 2000. Strategically set on Copenhagen's waterfront, it has presented operas and musicals to full houses ever since its opening.
Danes have also distinguished themselves in rhythmical music, with world-famous jazz musicians such as Svend Asmussen, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Niels Lan Doky and Marilyn Mazur. The Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation.
The modern pop and rock scene has produced some bands of note like Aqua, D-A-D, The Raveonettes, Michael Learns to Rock, Alphabeat, Medina, Oh Land, Kashmir, Mew , Outlandish and Dúné. All together, Lars Ulrich, drummer of the band Metallica, has become the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Cinema[edit]
Main article: Cinema of Denmark
In recent years, Danish films have gained increasing recognition at home and abroad. Gabriel Axel's film based on Karen Blixen's Babette's Feast was awarded an Oscar in 1987. In 1988, Bille August also received an Oscar with Pelle the Conqueror based on the novel by Martin Andersen Nexø. In 1992, August went on to win the Palme d'Or in Cannes with Ingmar Bergman's autobiography, The Best Intentions.
Since the late 1990s, the Dogme movement and figures such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Søren Kragh-Jacobsen and Lone Scherfig have continued to contribute to the international success of Danish cinema.[28] In 2011, Susanne Bier's In a Better World won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
Theatre[edit]
Main article: Theatre in Denmark




Royal Playhouse (left) and Copenhagen Opera House (background, right).


The theatre in Denmark continues to thrive thanks to the many theatres across the country which put on a wide variety of Danish and foreign performances. The flagship Royal Danish Theatre presents drama, opera, ballet and music. Since the 18th century, Danish playwrights have been successful in attracting wide public interest.
Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) is considered by many to be the founder of the Danish theatre. Satirical comedies such as Jean de France and Jeppe of the Hill are still performed today.[29]
Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850) introduced romanticism to the Danish theatre. Especially successful was his Earl Hakon the Mighty, premiered in 1808.
The Norwegian Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906) also travelled to Copenhagen where he produced numerous plays such as A Doll’s House (1879).[30]
In recent years, there has been something of a revival in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and producers have appeared including Astrid Saalbach (born 1955), winner of the Nordic Drama Award in 2004, and Peter Asmussen (born 1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves. Danish musicals have also been a particularly successful feature of the modern theatre. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand’s play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius-Bjerre's musical Matador (2007) is based on a successful TV series of the same name.[31]
Another popular Danish theatrical tradition is the revue which has been thriving since the mid-19th century. Today revues are performed every summer to full houses in theatres across Denmark, poking fun at the politics of the day and even the monarchy. Among the most popular are Circusrevyen in Copenhagen with Lisbet Dahl, and the Nykøbing Revy directed by Flemming Krøll in Nykøbing Falster.[32]
To this day, Denmark also has a large tradition for children- and Youth theater, as it host the largest annual children- and Youth theater event in the world, Aprilfestivallen, every year[33]
Television[edit]
Danish television has also contributed to drama with a number of successful series since the 1970s. Perhaps the most notable domestic and international successes have been the political drama Borgen and the three series of Forbrydelsen (The Killing, 2007–2012). Forbrydelsen attracted more than a 30% audience share, when originally broadcast in Denmark and both series have been widely sold around the world.[34]
Science[edit]




Tycho Brahe was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer and alchemist, and has been described more recently as "the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts."[35]


Denmark has a long tradition for scientific engagement in all fields, often with fundamental discoveries. The intelligentsia was involved in the European scientific revolution of the renaissance early on, with prominent scientists such as Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Ole Worm (1588–1655), Nicolas Steno (1638–1686) and Ole Rømer (1644–1710).
The contributions to science has steadily continued through the ages, with the fundamental discoveries of Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), the contributions to linguistics by Rasmus Rask (1787–1832), the neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy by Ludwig A. Colding's (1815–1888), Vilhelm Thomsen (1842–1927), Otto Jespersen (1860–1943) and others, into modern times with the brilliant contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962).




Niels Bohr was a renowned Danish physicist, specializing in atomic and quantum physics. He has been described as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He was also involved in the Manhattan Project.[36]


Niels Bohr founded several institutions in relation to quantum physics and both attracted and stimulated an important international and lasting scientific milieu in the country.[37] This has since produced many important discoveries and advancements in physics, astrophysics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering, particularly in the areas of quantum physics, quantum optics and lately nano-technology. Although an international environment, notable Danish scientists from this milieu includes Bengt Strömgren (1908–1987), Aage Bohr (1922–2009), Holger Bech Nielsen (born 1941) and Lene Vestergaard Hau (born 1959).
The science of geology has benefitted from scientists like Inge Lehmann (1888–1993) who, by the use of seismology, revealed that Earth have a solid inner core in 1936.
The young science of archaeology, has also benefited from many Danish contributions, with prominent scholars such as Sophus Müller, Georg F.L. Sarauw, J.J.A. Worsaae and Peter Glob. The contributions have often been of a fundamental nature, such as the discoveries of kitchen middens or bog bodies and their great potential for advancing archaeology. Christian Jürgensen Thomsen refined and introduced the now universally recognized three-age system, dividing eras of prehistory into the well-known Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age respectively. Danish archaeologists have contributed with many defining archaeological discoveries, such as the Kongemose culture, Maglemosian culture and the Ertebølle culture of the Nordic Stone Age and of course the Viking Age. With a great international engagement and a long tradition for interdisciplinary collaborations with anthropologists, geologists, zoologists, botanists, antiquarians and historians, Danish archaeologists have been, and still are, involved with all kinds of cultural archaeology around the globe, including the Middle East[38] (Peter Glob, Peter Rowley-Conwy), the Mediterranean region[39] (Peter Oluf Brøndsted, Jörgen Zoega) the Americas (Peter Wilhelm Lund, Frans Blom, Rane Willerslev) and the Arctic region (Therkel Mathiassen, Erik Holtved, Eigil Knuth).
Danes have made significant contributions to the field of computer science. Some notable figures include: Per Brinch Hansen, known for concurrent programming theory; Bjarne Stroustrup, who invented the C++ programming language; Janus Friis, the co-inventor of Skype; Jens and Lars Rasmussen, the co-founders of Google Maps; and Peter Naur, a contributor to ALGOL 60 and a recipient of the Turing Award.

LGBT[edit]
Main article: LGBT rights in Denmark




Copenhagen Gay pride parade, 2008


Social equality, including sexual equality, is a priority in Denmark.[40] Danes are somewhat tolerant towards sexual minorities.
Copenhagen is a popular destination for lesbian and bisexual travellers.[41] The main gay and lesbian festival of the year is the Copenhagen Pride Parade, a big Mardi Gras festival-like bash that occurs on a Saturday in early August. There's also the Copenhagen Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, held each year in October. In addition, Copenhagen has been host to the 2009 World Outgames. The LBL (Landsforeningen for Bøsser og Lesbiske, a national organisation for gay men and lesbians) was established in 1948, and in 1989 Denmark became the first country in the world to offer same-sex couples most of the same legal rights as opposite-sex couples, in the form of "registered partnership."[42][43]
Same-sex marriage became legal in Denmark on 15 June 2012, after the Danish parliament on 7 June voted in favour of it, including in the Church of Denmark.[44][45]
Adoption laws are liberal compared to other Western countries and public displays of affection between people of the same sex are less likely to provoke ire.[46] In March 2009 adoption was legalized for same-sex couples.

An NHS Trust broke the law by sharing sensitive patient records with Google's DeepMind division, the UK's data watchdog has ruled. The long-awaited decision falls in line with the conclusion drawn by Dame Fiona Caldicott, the UK's National Data Guardian in May. The pair's agreement "failed to comply" with the Data Protection Act 1998, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), because patients weren't informed that their information was being used. The ICO also took issue with the size of the dataset — 1.6 million partial patient records —  leveraged by DeepMind to test Streams, an app for detecting acute kidney injury.










In April 2016, New Scientist revealed that DeepMind and Royal Free London NHS Trust were working together on a medical project. As the ICO notes in its letter to the Trust, their agreement was actually formalised in September 2015, with Royal Free serving as the data controller (owner) and DeepMind as the data processor (partner).Initially, the deal was hashed out so Streams could be further developed by DeepMind and put through clinical safety testing. During this period, the ICO says the Trust — which ultimately takes responsibility, as data controller — broke four principles in the Data Protection Act. The first, which demands processing be "fair, lawful and transparent," was broken because the Trust and DeepMind didn't go far enough in their efforts to contact patients. Common law states, however, that consent can be implied if the data is being used for "direct care." Tests and full-blown medical use are different, however, so the ICO disregarded this defence."The Royal Free did not have a valid basis for satisfying the common law duty of confidence and therefore the processing of that data breached that duty," the ICO said in its letter to the Royal Free NHS Trust. "In this light, the processing was not lawful under the Act."The second broken principle, which is actually the third in the Act, requires data processing to be "adequate, relevant and not excessive." Following its investigation, the ICO concluded that 1.6 million patient records were too many for DeepMind's purposes. The Commissioner considered the Trust's defence, but couldn't see why that volume of information was necessary for the company's trials. "The Commission is not persuaded that it was necessary and proportionate to process 1.6 million partial patient records in order to test the clinical safety of the application. The processing of these records was, in the Commissioner's view, excessive," the ICO said.The Trust's failure to alert patients broke another principle that states data should be processed "in accordance with the rights of data subjects." Under section 10 of the Data Protection Act, patients should have the opportunity to pull their information from any data processing. The lack of transparency meant there was no way for patients to know, never mind act on this right. "Put plainly, if the patients did not know that their information would be used in this way, they could not take steps to object."The final principle concerns data protection standards. The ICO notes that additional agreements, including a privacy impact assessment, were drawn up in January and November 2016. By this time, however, DeepMind had already processed patient data. The watchdog is content with how DeepMind handles data, but disagrees with the documentation that was drawn up back in September 2015. It didn't go far enough, the ICO says, and could have resulted in a breach of the Data Protection Act. "The Commissioner does, however, recognise that the Royal Free has since improved the documentation in place between the Trust and DeepMind."The documentation drawn up last November means that Streams is now on a better legal footing. That's important, given the app has now passed the testing phase and is being used in hospitals. Nevertheless, the ICO has asked the Trust to commit to a series of changes. These include establishing "a proper legal basis" under the act for the current DeepMind agreement, and any future trials, completing a new privacy impact assessment and commissioning an audit of the initial trial period.The ICO has stressed that it doesn't want to impede innovation. It recognises the work DeepMind has done and the impact Streams has already had on the UK"s National Health Service. Privacy, however, should not be at the cost of progress, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham argues. "What stood out to me [after] looking through the investigation is that the shortcomings we found were avoidable," she said in a blog post. "The price of innovation didn't need to be the erosion of legally ensured fundamental privacy rights. I have every confidence the Trust can comply with the changes we've asked for and still continue its valuable work."

The Danish royal family consists of the dynastic family of the monarch.[1] All members of the Danish royal family, except Queen Margrethe II, hold the title of Prince/Princess of Denmark. Dynastic children of the monarch and of the heir apparent are accorded the style of His/Her Royal Highness, while other members of the dynasty are addressed as His/Her Highness. The Queen is styled Her Majesty.
The Queen and her siblings belong to the House of Glücksburg, which is a branch of the Royal House of Oldenburg. The Queen's children and male-line descendants belong agnatically to the family de Laborde de Monpezat, and were given the concurrent title Count/Countess of Monpezat by royal decree in April 2008.[2]
The Danish royal family enjoys remarkably high approval ratings in Denmark, possibly ranging from somewhere between 82% and 92%.[3][4]

Royal family of Greece[edit]
Main article: Greek royal family
Most of the members of the deposed royal family of Greece hold the title of Prince or Princess of Greece and Denmark with the qualification of His or Her Highness, pursuant to the Royal Cabinet Order of 1774 and as agnatic descendants of George I of Greece, who, as the son of the future King Christian IX of Denmark, was (and remained) a "Prince of Denmark" prior to his accession to the throne of Greece in 1863. Until 1953 his dynastic male-line descendants remained in Denmark's order succession. However, no Danish act has revoked usage of the princely title for these descendants, neither for those living in 1953, nor for those born subsequently or who have since married into the dynasty.
There are three members of the Greek royal family who are not known to bear the title of Prince/ss of Denmark with the qualification of His/Her Highness.[5][6][7]

Marina, consort of Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark

Princess Alexandra, Mrs. Mirzayantz
HRH Princess Olga, Duchess of Apulia



The following, consorts of royal monarchs today, were born with the titles of Prince/Princess of Greece and Denmark although they are not descended from King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie:

HM Queen Sofia of Spain (King Constantine's sister and Queen Anne-Marie's sister-in-law)
HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (son of Prince and Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark, grandson of King George I of Greece)

Royal family of Norway[edit]
Main article: Norwegian royal family
The royal family of Norway descends in the legitimate male line from Frederick VIII of Denmark, Queen Margrethe II's great-grandfather. Haakon VII of Norway, who was born Prince Carl of Denmark as Frederick VIII's younger son, was, like his uncle, George I of Greece, invited to reign over another nation. As with the Greek branch's descendants, members of the Norwegian line no longer have succession rights to the Danish crown, but unlike the Greek dynasts they discontinued use of Danish royal titles upon ascending their foreign throne in 1905.
Ducal family of Schleswig-Holstein[edit]
Main articles: House of Glücksburg § Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg
The Ducal Family of Schleswig-Holstein descends in the legitimate male line from Christian III of Denmark. As with the Greek branch's descendants, members of the Schleswig-Holstein line no longer have succession rights to the Danish crown, but unlike the Greek dynasts they discontinued use of Danish royal titles upon ascending their foreign throne in 1564.
Counts and Countesses of Rosenborg[edit]
Danish princes who marry without consent of the Danish monarch lose their dynastic rights, including royal title.[8] The ex-dynasts are then usually accorded the hereditary title "Count of Rosenborg". They, their wives, and their legitimate male-line descendants are:[9]

TE Count Ingolf of Rosenborg and Countess Sussie of Rosenborg (Prince Knud of Denmark's elder son and his wife)
TE Countess Josephine, Countess Camilla and Countess Feodora of Rosenborg (the daughters of Prince Knud of Denmark's late younger son, Count Christian of Rosenborg, and his late wife Countess Anne Dorte of Rosenborg)
TE Count Ulrik of Rosenborg and Countess Judi of Rosenborg (the son of Prince Harald of Denmark's younger son, Count Oluf of Rosenborg, and his wife)

HE Count Philip of Rosenborg (Count Ulrik's son)
HE Countess Katharina of Rosenborg (Count Ulrik's daughter)


HE Countess Charlotte of Rosenborg (the daughter of Prince Harald of Denmark's younger son, Count Oluf of Rosenborg)
TE Count Axel of Rosenborg and Countess Jutta of Rosenborg (the eldest son of Prince Axel of Denmark's younger son, Count Flemming Valdemar of Rosenborg, and his wife)

Line of succession[edit]
Main article: Line of succession to the Danish throne




Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark


The first law governing the succession to the Danish throne as a hereditary monarchy was the Kongeloven (Lex Regia), enacted 14 November 1665, and published in 1709.[10][11] It declared that the crown of Denmark shall descend by heredity to the legitimate descendants of King Frederick III, and that the order of succession shall follow semi-Salic primogeniture,[10] according to which the crown is inherited by an heir, with preference among the Monarch's children to males over females; among siblings to the elder over the younger; and among Frederick III's remoter descendants by substitution, senior branches over junior branches. Female descendants were eligible to inherit the throne in the event there were no eligible surviving male dynasts born in the male line. As for the duchies, Holstein and Lauenburg where the King ruled as duke, these lands adhered to Salic law (meaning that only males could inherit the ducal throne), and by mutual agreement were permanently conjoined. The duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief), Holstein and Lauenburg (German fiefs) were joined in personal union with the Crown of Denmark.
This difference caused problems when Frederick VII of Denmark proved childless, making a change in dynasty imminent, and causing the lines of succession for the duchies on one hand and for Denmark on the other to diverge. That meant that the new King of Denmark would not also be the new Duke of Schleswig or Duke of Holstein. To ensure the continued adhesion of the Elbe duchies to the Danish Crown, the line of succession to the duchies was modified in the London Protocol of 1852, which designated Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, as the new heir apparent, although he was, strictly, the heir neither to the Crown of Denmark nor to the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein or Lauenburg by primogeniture. Originally, the Danish prime minister Christian Albrecht Bluhme wanted to keep the separate hereditary principles, but in the end the government decided on a uniform agnatic primogeniture, which was accepted by the Parliament.
This order of succession remained in effect for a hundred years, then the Salic law was changed to male-preference primogeniture in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers. In 2009, the mode of inheritance of the throne was once more changed, this time into an absolute primogeniture. This imposed no immediate change on the line of succession as it was then, as Prince Vincent had not yet been born. The current line of succession is:

The Crown Prince Frederik
Prince Christian
Princess Isabella
Prince Vincent
Princess Josephine
Prince Joachim
Prince Nikolai
Prince Felix
Prince Henrik
Princess Athena
Princess Benedikte
Princess Elisabeth

Privileges and restrictions[edit]
Following the transformation of Denmark's monarchy from elective (at least theoretically, although it had generally descended to the eldest son of the House of Oldenburg since 1448) to hereditary in 1660, the so-called Kongelov established the reign "by the grace of God" of King Frederick III and his posterity.[10] Of the articles of this law, all except Article 21 and Article 25 have since been repealed. Article 21 states "No Prince of the Blood, who resides here in the Realm and in Our territory, shall marry, or leave the Country, or take service under foreign Masters, unless he receives Permission from the King".[10] Under this provision, princes of Denmark who permanently reside in other realms by express permission of the Danish Crown (i.e. members of the dynasties of Greece, Norway and the United Kingdom) do not thereby forfeit their royalty in Denmark, nor are they bound to obtain prior permission to travel abroad or to marry from its sovereign, although since 1950 those not descended in male-line from King Christian IX are no longer in the line of succession to the Danish throne.[10] However, those who do reside in Denmark or its territories continue to require the monarch's prior permission to travel abroad and to marry.[10]
Article 25 of the Kongelov stipulates, with respect to blood members of the Royal dynasty: "They should answer to no Magistrate Judges, but their first and last Judge shall be the King, or to whomsoever He decrees.".[10] The wording excludes those whose blood cannot be traced to a Danish monarch (e.g. the present Crown Princess).
Although all other articles of the Kongelov have been repealed by amendments to the Constitution in 1849, 1853 and 1953, these two articles have thus far been left intact.
Notes[edit]
1Princess Benedikte's children have no succession rights. This is because the marriage consent given to her had very specific provisions; if Benedikte ever became the heir presumptive, she and her husband would have to take permanent residence in Denmark and her children would only have succession rights if they had applied for naturalization upon reaching adulthood, and taken up residence in Denmark: (a) at the time of becoming the immediate heir to the throne, and (b) no later than when they reached the age of mandatory schooling under Danish law. Since the children continued to be educated in Germany well past the mandatory schooling age, they are deemed to no longer have succession rights.[12]
2Queen Anne-Marie has no succession rights, and her descendants have none through her, because the permission granted for her marriage stipulated that she renounced her claim to the Danish throne upon becoming Queen consort of the Hellenes.

They say revolutions don't happen overnight. They take years of anguish, and suffering, and hardship, until one day the dam breaks and a flood of people rise up together to create real change.
For years, the Venture Capital culture, with Silicon Valley as its nexus, has been rife with behavior that many consider abrasive and rude. However, looking only slightly under the surface, it has turned out that it goes far beyond that.
In the past weeks, we've seen the complete collapse of Binary Capital, a fund led by Justin Caldbeck, who allegedly assaulted multiple women, and Jonathan Teo, who allegedly assisted in covering up this behavior.
Dave McClure, Founder of 500 Startups, was forced to apologize for his lewd behavior, as well as resign from his role there, and as GP of the fund. Elizabeth Yin resigned in protest for his misconduct, and there are reports that others are not far behind.
Reid Hoffman, urged others in Silicon Valley to stand with him in signing a "Decency Pledge", that would show which funds are allies to women, yet as more funds showed their support for this, other reports came forward against some of the people using this hashtag, which highlighted the point that the unethical behavior of certain VCs is unlikely to end anytime soon.
Since this story initially broke, more people have started to come forward. Cheryl Yeoh posted her experiences with Dave McClure, which may have been the   lynchpin for his resignation. Comments made by Cathryn Chen, myself and others are eerily echoed in the words of Amy Varle, founder of the People's Property Shop. "It actually makes me cry to read these comments and know I'm not alone. I have literally been stalked and bribed with a 100,000 investment via the latest guy. Its made me sick on a daily basis."
There has been backlash against these women. VCs Sam Altman and Chris Swies got involved in the fray. Chris Sacca, himself named in the New York Times article, disputed the claim against him. As more women are coming forward, men are starting to fight back, turning this into a she-said, he-said.
Clearly, something isn't working.
As I've been digging into this story since I started covering it, I've found that it goes deeper than simple gender bias. Not only have women come to me with their stories, I've heard from men who have had similar experiences of their being harassed while vulnerable - only they feel the repercussions for their coming forward would be too harmful for them to deal with.
Wherever there is a power imbalance, it is too easy for things to be misconstrued.
On the VC side, they may very well be innocently thinking: "Hey, this person is really fun to hang out with." Unfortunately, they're not taking into account the worldview of the person on the other side.
This other person is in an automatically vulnerable position. They're not on the same level as the VC, because they have a fiduciary responsibility to their company to make payroll, pay vendors, get product out, etc. To them, at some level, the VC represents certainty, security. That person will never be "really fun to hang with."
Chris Sacca, Dave McClure, even Justin Caldbeck and all the rest may well have had purely innocent intentions - in their own minds. Where they have failed is they did not take into account the other people around them.
I'm happy to talk to anyone in Silicon Valley or anywhere who would like help in understanding perspective. Maybe then we'll start to make some progress.

The krone (Danish pronunciation: [ˈkʁoːnə]; plural: kroner; sign: kr.; code: DKK) is the official currency of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, introduced on 1 January 1875.[3] Both the ISO code "DKK" and currency sign "kr." are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish crown in English, since krone literally means crown. Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century.
One krone is subdivided into 100 øre (Danish pronunciation: [ˈøːɐ]; singular and plural), the name øre possibly deriving from Latin aureus meaning "gold coin".[4] Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the 50 øre coin, which is valued at one half of a krone. Formerly there were more øre coins, but those were discontinued due to inflation.
The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II, the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. Adoption of the euro is favoured by the major political parties, however a 2000 referendum on joining the Eurozone was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone.[5]

History[edit]




A Danish silver two rigsdaler piece of 1868, with the portrait of Christian IX.






Two golden 20 kr coins from the Scandinavian Monetary Union, with identical weight and composition. The coin to the left is Swedish and the right one is Danish.


The oldest known Danish coin is a penny (penning) struck AD 825–840,[6] but the earliest systematic minting produced the so-called korsmønter or "cross coins" minted by Harald Bluetooth in the late 10th century.[7] Organised minting in Denmark was introduced on a larger scale by Canute the Great in the 1020s. Lund was the principal minting place and one of Denmark's most important cities in the Middle Ages, but coins were also minted in Roskilde, Slagelse, Odense, Aalborg, Århus, Viborg, Ribe, Ørbæk and Hedeby. For almost 1,000 years, Danish kings – with a few exceptions – have issued coins with their name, monogram and/or portrait.[3] Taxes were sometimes imposed via the coinage, e.g. by the compulsory substitution of coins handed in by new coins handed out with a lower silver content.[3]
Danish coinage was generally based on the Carolingian silver standard. Periodically, the metal value of the minted coins was reduced, and thus did not correspond to the face value of the coins. This was mainly done to generate income for the monarch and/or the state. As a result of the debasement, the public started to lose trust in the respective coins. Danish currency was overhauled several times in attempts to restore public trust in the coins, and later in issued paper money.[3]
In 1619 a new currency was introduced in Denmark, the krone (crown). One krone had the value of 1 1/2 Danish Rigsdaler Species accounting for 96 Kroneskillinger, later for 144 common Skillings.[8]
Until the late 18th century, the krone was a denomination equal to 8 mark, a subunit of the Danish rigsdaler.[9] A new krone was introduced as the currency of Denmark in January 1875. It replaced the rigsdaler at a rate of 2 kroner = 1 rigsdaler. This placed the krone on the gold standard at a rate of 2480 kroner = 1 kilogram fine gold. The latter part of the 18th century and much of the 19th century saw expanding economic activity and thus also a need for means of payment that were easier to handle than coins. Consequently, banknotes were increasingly used instead of coins.[3]
The introduction of the new krone was a result of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, which came into effect in 1873 (with the coins being adopted two years later) and lasted until World War I. The parties to the union were the three Scandinavian countries, where the name was krone in Denmark and Norway and krona in Sweden, a word which in all three languages literally means crown. The three currencies were on the gold standard, with the krone/krona defined as  1⁄2480 of a kilogram of pure gold.
The Scandinavian Monetary Union came to an end in 1914 when the gold standard was abandoned. Denmark, Sweden and Norway all decided to keep the names of their respective and now separate currencies.
Denmark returned to the gold standard in 1924 but left it permanently in 1931. Between 1940 and 1945, the krone was tied to the German Reichsmark. Following the end of the German occupation, a rate of 24 kroner to the British pound was introduced, reduced to 19.34 (4.8 kroner = 1 US dollar) in August the same year. Within the Bretton Woods System, Denmark devalued its currency with the pound in 1949 to a rate of 6.91 to the dollar. A further devaluation in 1967 resulted in rates of 7.5 kroner.
In 2014, it was decided to stop printing of the Krone in Denmark, but would be outsourced, and on 20 December 2016, the last notes were printed by the National Bank.[10]
Current status[edit]
Relationship to the euro[edit]
Main article: Denmark and the euro
Denmark has not introduced the euro, following a rejection by referendum in 2000, but the Danish krone is pegged closely to the euro in ERM II, the EU's exchange rate mechanism. Denmark borders one eurozone member, Germany, and one EU member, Sweden, which is legally obliged to join the euro in the future (though Sweden maintains that joining ERM II is voluntary, thus avoiding euro adoption for the time being).
Faroe Islands and Greenland[edit]
Main articles: Faroese króna and Greenlandic krone
The Faroe Islands uses a localized, non-independent version of the Danish krone, known as the Faroese króna pegged with the Danish krone at par, using the Danish coin series, but have their own series of distinct banknotes, first being issued in the 1950s and later modernized in the 1970s and the 2000s.
Greenland adopted the Act on Banknotes in Greenland in 2006 with a view to introducing separate Greenlandic banknotes. The Act entered into force on 1 June 2007. In the autumn of 2010, a new Greenlandic government indicated that it did not wish to introduce separate Greenlandic banknotes and Danmarks Nationalbank ceased the project to develop a Greenlandic series. Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency. Historically, Greenland under the colonial administration issued distinct banknotes between 1803 and 1968, together with coins between 1926 and 1964 (see Greenland rigsdaler and Greenland krone).
Coins[edit]
Alloys and colour scheme[edit]




A tin-bronze 50-øre coin



A cupronickel 1-krone coin



An aluminium bronze 10-kroner coin (2011- series)



The design of the coin series is intended to ensure that the coins are easy to distinguish from each other:
The series is therefore divided into three sequences, each with its own metal colour. This division into colours has its roots in history. In earlier times, the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted: gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations, silver for the next-highest, and copper for the lowest coin denominations. This correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present coin series (see examples to the right). The 50-øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10- and 20-krone coins from golden aluminium bronze.
The coins differ in terms of size, weight and rim. Within each sequence the diameter and weight of the coins increase with their value. The 50-øre and 10-krone coins have smooth rims, while the rims of the 1- and 5-krone coins are milled. The rims of the 2- and 20-krone coins have interrupted milling. The 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins have a hole in the middle. Use of these various characteristics makes it easy for the blind and sight-impaired to tell the coins apart.

Commemoratives and thematic coins[edit]
Main article: Commemorative coins of Denmark
The coins of the programme have the same size and metal composition as the regular coins of their denomination.
The first series, 20-krone coins featuring towers in Denmark, ran between 2002 and 2007 and spawned ten different motifs. Upon selecting the towers, importance had been attached not only to display aesthetic towers, but also towers with different form, functions and from different regions of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The last coin depicting the Copenhagen City Hall was issued in June 2007, marking the end of the series. A second series of 20-krone coins, starting in 2007 with twelve different planned motifs and ten already released by November 2011, shows Denmark as a maritime nation in the world, featuring iconic Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic ships and like the previous series of tower coins, the series reflect various landmarks in shipbuilding in the three countries.
In 2005, Danmarks Nationalbank issued the first in a series of five 10-krone commemorative coins with motifs from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales. The motifs depicted on the coins were chosen to illustrate various aspects and themes central to the fairy tales with the fifth and final fairy tale coin inspired by The Nightingale being issued on 25 October 2007.[11] In 2007, as the fairy tale series ended, a second series of three 10-krone commemorative coins was introduced, celebrating the International Polar Year. Featuring motifs of a polar bear, the Sirius Sledge Patrol and the Aurora Borealis, the coins aimed to accentuate scientific research in the backdrop of Greenlandic culture and geography. The third and final coin entitled 'Northern Lights' marked the completion of the series in 2009.[12]

Bridge series[edit]
The process of designing the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank.[16] The theme of the new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between the past and the present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.

Nicknames[edit]
Within context, some of the banknotes have figurative meanings with the 100-krone note sometimes referred to as a hund (dog) shortening the word hundrede (a hundred). The 500-krone note can be referred to as a plovmand (ploughman) because previous circulations of the note featured a picture of a man with a plough and the 1000-krone note, too, can be referred to as a tudse (toad) taken from a wordplay on the word tusinde meaning a thousand. The 1000-krone note may also be referred to as an egern (squirrel) because of previous circulations of the note featuring a squirrel[citation needed].

 WASHINGTON POST “COLOR OF MONEY” BOOK CLUB PICKStop Living Paycheck to Paycheck and Get Your Financial Life Together (#GYFLT)!   If you’re a cash-strapped 20- or 30-something, it’s easy to get freaked out by finances. But you’re not doomed to spend your life drowning in debt or mystified by money. It’s time to stop scraping by and take control of your money and your life with this savvy and smart guide.   Broke Millennial shows step-by-step how to go from flat-broke to financial badass. Unlike most personal finance books out there, it doesn’t just cover boring stuff like credit card debt, investing, and dealing with the dreaded “B” word (budgeting). Financial expert Erin Lowry goes beyond the basics to tackle tricky money matters and situations most of us face #IRL, including:  - Understanding your relationship with moolah: do you treat it like a Tinder date or marriage material? - Managing student loans without having a full-on panic attack - What to do when you’re out with your crew and can’t afford to split the bill evenly- How to get “financially naked” with your partner and find out his or her “number” (debt number, of course)  . . . and much more.   Packed with refreshingly simple advice and hilarious true stories, Broke Millennial is the essential roadmap every financially clueless millennial needs to become a money master. So what are you waiting for? Let’s #GYFLT!

Review


“This book is well worth its list price….It’s the youthful perspective that makes this so refreshing. It’s well-written and researched by a millennial for millennials…without the judgment, sarcasm and superiority we older folks too often convey when we talk to young adults about money.” —Michelle Singletary, The Washington Post“A new book about money that teens and millennials will actually read…. This not only has great insights and tips about handling money, but it's written in a casual, relatable way.” —Time   “Broke Millennial does a great job of presenting practical how-to money advice in a conversational way…. The tone is one that makes you feel like, 'we're all in this together,' and not the typical talking to you like you're a kid that you often find in other books geared toward young adults."—Jason Dorsey, bestselling author, millennial expert, and president of The Center for Generational Kinetics   “It’s a price worth paying to own a helpful book like Broke Millennial. Erin Lowry explains nearly everything consumers need to know about finances, in layman’s terms and simple steps. Best of all, though it’s meant for 20-somethings, this book isn’t specific to them: you really can give it to a wise middle-schooler or a grownup in need of the info. For anyone old enough to read this book, Broke Millennial won’t be a bust.” —Twin Cities Business Magazine“If you haven't quite got the hang of ‘adulting,’ follow Erin Lowry's spot-on, often funny financial advice. You'll be inspired by how she successfully sidestepped student loan debt, negotiated a 40% (yes, 40%!) raise, and managed to tackle a host of thorny money situations. Best of all, Erin reveals how you can do all this too. Broke Millennial is not your typical personal finance book. This is the wisdom I wish I had in my twenties and early thirties!” —Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, cofounder of AskTheMoneyCoach.com and New York Times bestselling author of Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom   "Broke Millennial takes the typical preaching and finger-wagging out of money lessons and replaces them with humor, empathy and a fun, pick-your-financial-path twist, while offering helpful and practical advice to successfully navigate all the financial questions you’ll face in the real world."  —Farnoosh Torabi, financial expert and host of the award-winning podcast, So Money   "The ultimate millennial guidebook on money matters…. I highly recommend it." —Jason Vitug, bestselling author of You Only Live Once: The Roadmap to Financial Wellness and a Purposeful Life   "My go-to personal finance book when I am working with millennials…. It’s filled with practical step-by-step instructions and guides that any twenty- or thirty-something can easily use to change their financial situation."—Lauren Greutman, Frugal Living Expert at Lauren Greutman.com   “Rich with specific advice to guide readers on the path to financial wellness. Millennials who may be overspending because of #FOMO need to read this book stat!” —Bobbi Rebell, author of How to Be a Financial Grownup: Proven Advice from High Achievers on How to Live your Dreams and Have Financial Freedom    “Thinking about money, especially when you don’t have much, can be painful. But Erin Lowry shows that you don’t need to be a mathematical genius to get on the right track. She makes it easy for people to build a financially healthy plan for life. Spend some time with this book, and your financial decisions and confidence will improve, no doubt.”—Nicholas Clements, cofounder of MagnifyMoney.com

Customer reviews5.0 out of 5 stars545.0 out of 5 stars5 star98%4 star2%3 star0%2 star0%1 star0%Share your thoughts with other customersWrite a customer reviewSee all verified purchase reviewsTop customer reviews5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Book For Learning The Basics of All Things Personal FinanceByNick Trueon May 13, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book is a top notch intro to personal finance. If you're a young(ish) person, I want to start getting control of your money this book is for you. The book has a hefty focus on the mental aspect of finances, which I personally think is the most important. So I really appreciated that.But here's a quick overview of what you can expect.It covers- The mindset and mental blocks you may have around money (based on how you grew up)- How to overcome bad financial mindsets and how to create a good financial mindset- Different situations you might be in and how to handle them (allows different people to relate in different ways)- Ideal benchmarks for you to hit in order to be "on track" with your money at certain ages- Different financial products (investment accounts, bank accounts, credit cards) and how to look for the best ones- Basics of investing and retirement planning- Basics of buying a house vs renting- Info about credit cards and credit reportsBasically, this book covers all things personal finance in a really approachable and digestible way. I've been studying finance for years, and rarely come across something this comprehensive that still holds my attention. There's a good balance of storytelling and practical advice.It's not an investment book or advanced level retirement planning guide or hardcore tax strategy book. It's a solid book on how to go from not knowing much about your money to totally killing it. It would be comparable to Ramit Sethi's I Will Teach You To Be Rich, if you like that book, you'll love this one too.Highly recommend.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFantastic read!BySherifon May 6, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI've read my fair share of personal finance books but it wasn't until I picked this book up that I realized how very few of them are geared for folks in their early 20s, recent grads and young professionals.Two things stand out. One, it couples sound financial knowledge with advice on how to reorient your attitude towards money in a more productive way, especially with partners and peers. Two, the advice on both debt and investing were extremely relevant to where I am financially.An example of excellent framing: Erin suggests having a great credit score as financial insurance to give you access to the best credit products if you find yourself in a financial bind which you intuit, but reframed my relationship and understanding of debt and my own credit score.Can't recommend this enough!Read more0Comment|

This tidy volume ...ByMelissa Thatchon May 14, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseA treasure trove of financial information! This tidy volume should be read by anyone looking for sound financial advice. The author explains the ins and outs of a variety financial subjects in an interesting and even humorous manner which makes the book an enjoyable read--no tedium here. She tackles her subject with objectivity and clarity. This book may be generally geared to the "millennial generation" but it applies across the board to anyone looking to understand sound financial principles and apply them.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWish I had this book when I graduated college!ByAliaon May 22, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseA fun and easy-to-understand read!  Broke Millennial covers the basics of personal finance in a tone that's entertaining but still serious and clear.  Although I'm pretty well-versed in the building blocks of a good financial life, I did find that there was plenty to learn (history of the FICO score, which bank fees should be easy to avoid, etc) and it's nice to have all this information in one place.  Erin is clearly very smart and the book is very well organized so you can flip around to what you need.  This book would have been so helpful to me in my early twenties when I was just starting my career and really living in that paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.  Makes a perfect gift for a recent grad or anyone in their early, mid or late twenties!Read more0Comment|

My first choice of books is definitely not a finance book. I know I needed to get my act together if I wanted to be successful with my money. I am completely blown away by this book. Erin Lowry is amazing. She truly knows how to connect with her audience (even the ones who don't have the first clue about finance). I talk about this book all the time and have incorporated so many of the things she talks about doing into my life. I am already starting to see the benefit of buying this book. I recommend to any age group but especially younger adults! Love it!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsHIGHLY recommend if you want to Get Your Financial Life Together #GYFLTByMWon May 18, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI've read A LOT of personal finance books. Broke Millennial is by far is the best and most entertaining. I love that Erin starts out with talking about money mindset, but she doesn't linger there like many other books do. The chapters are insanely practical. Even as someone who probably gets a financial "gold star" (read the book), I'm learning so much from Broke Millennial as to how I can improve more. HIGHLY recommend for anyone in their 20's or 30's who wants brass tacks money advice minus the woo-woo and/or being talked down to by "experts".Read more0Comment|

Denmark (/ˈdɛnmɑːrk/ ( listen); Danish: Danmark [ˈdanmɑɡ] ( listen)), officially the Kingdom of Denmark,[N 8] is a Nordic country and a sovereign state. The southernmost of the Scandinavian nations, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway,[N 9] and bordered to the south by Germany. With a total area of 42,924 square kilometres (16,573 sq mi)[3] the European territory of Denmark consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands,[N 2][8] with the largest being Zealand, Funen and the North Jutlandic Island. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. The country has a population of around 5.75 million (as of 2017[update]).[4] The Kingdom of Denmark also comprises two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland.
The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea.[2] Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy.
The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. It establishes a constitutional monarchy organised as a parliamentary democracy. The government and national parliament are seated in Copenhagen, the nation's capital, largest city and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948; in Greenland home rule was established in 1979 and further autonomy in 2009. Denmark became a member of the European Economic Community (now the EU) in 1973, maintaining certain opt-outs; it retains its own currency, the krone. It is among the founding members of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area.
Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the country ranks highly in some metrics of national performance, including education, health care, protection of civil liberties, democratic governance, prosperity and human development.[9][10][11] The country ranks as having the world's highest social mobility,[12] a high level of income equality,[13] is the country with the lowest perceived level of corruption in the world, has one of the world's highest per capita incomes, and one of the world's highest personal income tax rates.[14]

Etymology
Main article: Etymology of Denmark
The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate.[15][16] This is centred primarily on the prefix "Dan" and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the -"mark" ending.
Most handbooks derive the first part of the word, and the name of the people, from a word meaning "flat land",[17] related to German Tenne "threshing floor", English den "cave".[17] The -mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland (see marches), with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig.[18]
The first recorded use of the word Danmark within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones, which are runestones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old (c. 955) and Harald Bluetooth (c. 965). The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmark's baptismal certificate (dåbsattest),[19] though both use the word "Denmark", in the form of accusative ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ "tanmaurk" ([danmɒrk]) on the large stone, and genitive ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ "tanmarkar" (pronounced [danmarkaɽ]) on the small stone.[20] The inhabitants of Denmark are there called "tani" ([danɪ]), or "Danes", in the accusative.

Prehistory




The gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot dating from the Nordic Bronze Age.


The earliest archaeological findings in Denmark date back to the Eem interglacial period from 130,000–110,000 BC.[21] Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC.[22] The Nordic Bronze Age (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by burial mounds, which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot.
During the Pre-Roman Iron Age (500 BC – AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal Danes came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the Germanic Iron Age,[23] in the Roman Iron Age (AD 1–400).[22] The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and Roman coins have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron.
The tribal Danes came from the east Danish islands (Zealand) and Scania and spoke an early form of North Germanic. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of Jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal Jutes. The Jutes migrated to Great Britain eventually, some as mercenaries by Brythonic King Vortigern, and were granted the south-eastern territories of Kent, the Isle of Wight and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading Angles and Saxons, who formed the Anglo-Saxons. The remaining Jutish population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling Danes.
A short note about the Dani in "Getica" by the historian Jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the ethnic groups from whom modern Danes are descended.[24][25] The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king.[26] A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.
Viking and Middle Ages
Main articles: Viking Age and Kalmar Union




The Ladby ship, the largest ship burial found in Denmark.


From the 8th to the 10th century the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern British Isles and Western Europe. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, and France where Danes and Norwegians founded Normandy with Rollo as head of state. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.[27]




Larger of the two Jelling stones, raised by Harald Bluetooth.


Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources as kings (reges). Under the reign of Gudfred in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the lands of Jutland, Scania and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.[28] The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to Gorm the Old, who established his reign in the early 10th century.[2] As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were Christianised around 965 by Harald Bluetooth, the son of Gorm. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire, which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.[27]
Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (the areas of Scania, Halland, and Blekinge in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.
In 1397, Denmark entered into a personal union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I.[29] The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union.[30] Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm. The Protestant Reformation spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count's Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

Early modern history (1536–1849)
Main articles: Denmark–Norway and Danish colonial empire

After Sweden permanently broke away from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King Christian IV attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 Kalmar War but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark, an amount known as the Älvsborg ransom.[31] King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg) and Christiania. Inspired by the Dutch East India Company, he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on India's Coromandel Coast. Denmark's large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in Africa and India. The empire was sustained by trade with other major powers, and plantations – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation.[32]
In the Thirty Years' War, Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter.[33] The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war.[34] Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King Gustavus Adolphus' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining. In 1643, Swedish armies invaded Jutland and claimed Scania in 1644.
In the 1645 Treaty of Brømsebro, Denmark surrendered Halland, Gotland, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway. In 1657, King Frederick III declared war on Sweden and marched on Bremen-Verden. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered both Jutland, Funen, and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Scania, Blekinge, Trøndelag, and the island of Bornholm. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked Denmark and in August 1658, he began a two-year-long siege of Copenhagen but failed to take the capital.[35] In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.

Denmark tried to regain control of Scania in the Scanian War (1675–1679) but it ended in failure. Following the Great Northern War (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein-Gottorp in the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg and the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark traded with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia.[36] The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807, in one case carrying off the Danish fleet, in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British Gunboat War. British control over the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went bankrupt.
The Danish-Norwegian union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814; the Danish monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king.[37] After the dissolution of the union with Norway, Denmark kept the possessions of Iceland (which retained the Danish monarchy until 1944), the Faroe Islands and Greenland, all of which had been governed by Norway for centuries.[38] Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark continued to rule over Danish India from 1620 to 1869, the Danish Gold Coast (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the Danish West Indies from 1671 to 1917.
Constitutional monarchy (1849–present)




The National Constitutional Assembly was convened by King Frederick VII in 1848 to adopt the Constitution of Denmark.


A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European Revolutions of 1848, Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a two-chamber parliament. Denmark faced war against both Prussia and Habsburg Austria in what became known as the Second Schleswig War, lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.
Industrialisation came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century.[39] The nation's first railroads were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. Trade unions developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.
Denmark maintained its neutral stance during World War I. After the defeat of Germany, the Versailles powers offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German irredentism, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite; the two Schleswig Plebiscites took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and 3,984 square kilometres (1,538 sq mi).
In 1939 Denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany but Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940 and the Danish government quickly surrendered. World War II in Denmark was characterised by economic co-operation with Germany until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to Sweden, which was neutral. The Danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to evacuate several thousand Jews and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported Nazism by joining the Danish Nazi Party or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the Frikorps Danmark.[40] Iceland severed ties to Denmark and became an independent republic in 1944; Germany surrendered in May 1945; in 1948, the Faroe Islands gained home rule; in 1949, Denmark became a founding member of NATO.




Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.


Denmark was a founding member of European Free Trade Association (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC).[41] In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) after a public referendum. The Maastricht Treaty, which involved further European integration, was rejected by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993, which provided for four opt-outs from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009. Neither the Faroe Islands nor Greenland are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.
Constitutional change in 1953 led to a single-chamber parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The centre-left Social Democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the Nordic welfare model. The Liberal Party and the Conservative People's Party have also led centre-right governments. In recent years the right-wing populist[42] Danish People's Party has emerged as a major party—becoming the second-largest following the 2015 general election—during which time immigration and integration have become major issues of public debate.

A satellite image of Jutland and the Danish islands.


Located in Northern Europe, Denmark[N 2] consists of the peninsula of Jutland and 443 named islands (1,419 islands above 100 square metres (1,100 sq ft) in total).[44] Of these, 74 are inhabited (January 2015),[45] with the largest being Zealand, the North Jutlandic Island, and Funen. The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the Øresund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden; the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand; and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. The largest cities with populations over 100,000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Aarhus and Aalborg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen.

The country occupies a total area of 42,924 square kilometres (16,573 sq mi)[3] The area of inland water is 700 km2 (270 sq mi), variously stated as from 500 – 700 km2 (193–270 sq m). Lake Arresø northwest of Copenhagen is the largest lake. The size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects (to counter erosion). Post-glacial rebound raises the land by a bit less than 1 cm (0.4 in) per year in the north and east, extending the coast. A circle enclosing the same area as Denmark would be 234 kilometres (145 miles) in diameter with a circumference of 742 km (461 mi). It shares a border of 68 kilometres (42 mi) with Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by 8,750 km (5,437 mi) of tidal shoreline (including small bays and inlets).[46] No location in Denmark is farther from the coast than 52 km (32 mi). On the south-west coast of Jutland, the tide is between 1 and 2 m (3.28 and 6.56 ft), and the tideline moves outward and inward on a 10 km (6.2 mi) stretch.[47] Denmark's territorial waters total 105,000 square kilometres (40,541 square miles).
Denmark's northernmost point is Skagen's point (the north beach of the Skaw) at 57° 45' 7" northern latitude; the southernmost is Gedser point (the southern tip of Falster) at 54° 33' 35" northern latitude; the westernmost point is Blåvandshuk at 8° 4' 22" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Østerskær at 15° 11' 55" eastern longitude. This is in the archipelago Ertholmene 18 kilometres (11 mi) north-east of Bornholm. The distance from east to west is 452 kilometres (281 mi), from north to south 368 kilometres (229 mi).
The country is flat with little elevation, having an average height above sea level of 31 metres (102 ft). The highest natural point is Møllehøj, at 170.86 metres (560.56 ft).[48] A sizeable portion of Denmark's terrain consists of rolling plains whilst the coastline is sandy, with large dunes in northern Jutland. Although once extensively forested, today Denmark largely consists of arable land. It is drained by a dozen or so rivers, and the most significant include the Gudenå, Odense, Skjern, Suså and Vidå—a river that flows along its southern border with Germany.
The Kingdom of Denmark includes two overseas territories, both well to the west of Denmark: Greenland, the world's largest island, and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. These territories are self-governing and form part of the Danish Realm.
Climate
Denmark has a temperate climate, characterised by mild winters, with mean temperatures in January of 1.5 °C (34.7 °F), and cool summers, with a mean temperature in August of 17.2 °C (63.0 °F).[49] The most extreme temperatures recorded in Denmark, since 1874 when recordings began, was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) in 1975 and −31.2 °C (−24.2 °F) in 1982.[50] Denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation, on average receiving a total of 765 millimetres (30 in) per year; autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest.[49] The position between a continent and an ocean means that weather often changes.[51]
Because of Denmark's northern location, there are large seasonal variations in daylight. There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45 am and sunset 3:45 pm (standard time), as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30 am and sunset at 10 pm (daylight saving time).[52]

Ecology
Further information: List of forests in Denmark, List of mammals of Denmark, and List of birds of Denmark




The Danish landscape is characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts.



Beech trees are common throughout Denmark, especially in the sparse woodlands.




Denmark belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests.[53] Almost all of Denmark's primeval temperate forests have been destroyed or fragmented, chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia.[54] The deforestation has created large swaths of heathland and devastating sand drifts.[54] In spite of this, there are several larger second growth woodlands in the country and, in total, 12.9% of the land is now forested.[55] Norway spruce is the most widespread tree (2017), being important in the production of Christmas trees.
Roe deer occupy the countryside in growing numbers, and large-antlered red deer can be found in the sparse woodlands of Jutland. Denmark is also home to smaller mammals, such as polecats, hares and hedgehogs.[56] Approximately 400 bird species inhabit Denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country.[57] Large marine mammals include healthy populations of Harbour porpoise, growing numbers of pinnipeds and occasional visits of large whales, including blue whales and orcas. Cod, herring and plaice are abundant fish in Danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry.[58]
Environment
Land and water pollution are two of Denmark's most significant environmental issues, although much of the country's household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled. The country has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation; in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973.[59] To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol.[60] However, the national ecological footprint is 8.26 global hectares per person, which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010.[61] Contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land,[62] which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in Denmark (115.8 kilograms (255 lb) meat annually per capita) and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries.[63] In December 2014, the Climate Change Performance Index for 2015 placed Denmark at the top of the table, explaining that although emissions are still quite high, the country was able to implement effective climate protection policies.[64]
Denmark has an outstanding performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 4 out of 180 countries in 2016. This recent and significant increase in ranking and performance is mostly due to remarkable achievements in energy efficiency and reductions in CO2 emission levels. A future implementation of air quality improvements are expected. The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The environmental areas where Denmark performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) are sanitation (12), water resource management (13) and health impacts of environmental issues (14), followed closely by the area of biodiversity and habitat. The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI.[65] Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries (128)[66] and forest management (96). The very poor ranking in the fisheries area are due to alarmingly low and continually rapidly declining fish stocks, placing Denmark among the worst performing countries of the world.[67][68]
Administrative divisions

Denmark, with a total area of 43,094 square kilometres (16,639 sq mi), is divided into five administrative regions (Danish: regioner). The regions are further subdivided into 98 municipalities (kommuner). The easternmost land in Denmark, the Ertholmene archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq m), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the Ministry of Defence.[69]
The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the sixteen former counties. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 270. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule.[70] The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent Danish local elections were held on 19 November 2013. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the police districts, the court districts and the electoral wards.
Regions
The governing bodies of the regions are the regional councils with forty-one members elected for four-year terms. The head of the council is the regional council chairman (regionsrådsformand), who is elected by the council.[71] The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the national health service, social services and regional development.[71][72] Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (sundhedsbidrag), partly by funds from both government and municipalities.[14] From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished, as it is being replaced by higher income tax instead.
The area and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the Capital Region, which encompasses the Copenhagen metropolitan area with the exception of the subtracted province East Zeeland but includes the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm, has a population three times larger than that of North Denmark Region, which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg, had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These sui generis municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.

Greenland and the Faroe Islands
The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary state that comprises, in addition to Denmark proper, two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: Greenland and the Faroe Islands. They have been integrated parts of the Danish Realm since the 18th century; however, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm have extensive political powers and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.[73] The Faroe Islands gained home rule in 1948 and Greenland in 1979, having previously had the status of counties.[74]
The two territories have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively self-governing in regards to domestic affairs.[74] High Commissioners (Rigsombudsmand) act as representatives of the Danish government in the Faroese Løgting and in the Greenlandic Parliament, but they cannot vote.[74] The Faroese home government is defined to be an equal partner with the Danish national government,[75] while the Greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to self-determination.[76]

Politics in Denmark operates under a framework laid out in the Constitution of Denmark.[N 10] First written in 1849, it establishes a sovereign state in the form of a constitutional monarchy, with a representative parliamentary system. The Monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council).[80][81] In practice, the duties of the Monarch are strictly representative and ceremonial,[N 11][82] such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other Government ministers. The Monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and their person is sacrosanct.[83] Hereditary monarch Queen Margrethe II has been head of state since 14 January 1972.
Government
Main articles: Folketing and Cabinet of Denmark
The Danish Parliament is called the Folketing (Danish: Folketinget). It is the legislature of the Kingdom of Denmark, passing Acts that apply in Denmark and, in limited cases, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the state's budgets, approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation. Bills may be initiated by the Government or by members of parliament. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive Royal Assent within thirty days in order to become law.[84]




Christiansborg Palace houses the Folketing, the Supreme Court, and Government offices.


Denmark is a representative democracy with universal suffrage.[N 12] Membership of the Folketing is based on proportional representation of political parties,[85] with a 2% electoral threshold. Danes elect 175 members to the Folketing, with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total.[86] Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the Prime Minister to ask the Monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a vote of no confidence, the Folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign.[87]
The Government of Denmark operates as a cabinet government, where executive authority is exercised—formally on behalf of the Monarch—by Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers, who head ministries. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the Folketing; this is usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments, themselves sometimes minority governments dependent on non-government parties.[88]
Following a general election defeat, in June 2015 Helle Thorning-Schmidt, leader of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne), resigned as Prime Minister. She was succeeded by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the leader of the Liberal Party (Venstre). Rasmussen became the leader of a cabinet which, unusually, consisted entirely of ministers from his own party. In the next cabinet, created November 2016, there are several political parties represented.
Law and judicial system
Main articles: Law of Denmark and Courts of Denmark
See also: Crime in Denmark
Denmark has a civil law system with some references to Germanic law. Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a case-law like that of England and the United States nor comprehensive codes like those of France and Germany. Much of its law is customary.[89]
The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the Constitution ensure judicial independence from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice.[90] The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third.[91] However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts. The Danish Supreme Court is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the Kingdom.
Foreign relations
Main article: Foreign relations of Denmark
Denmark wields considerable influence in Northern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs.[92] In recent years, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing, whaling, and geopolitical concerns. The foreign policy of Denmark is substantially influenced by its membership of the European Union (EU); Denmark joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the EU's predecessor, in 1973.[N 13] Denmark held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on seven occasions, most recently from January to June 2012.[93] Following World War II, Denmark ended its two-hundred-year-long policy of neutrality. It has been a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1949, and membership remains highly popular.[94]
As a member of Development Assistance Committee (DAC), Denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to development aid. In 2015, Denmark contributed 0.85% of its gross national income (GNI) to foreign aid and was one of only six countries meeting the longstanding UN target of 0.7% of GNI.[N 14][95] The country participates in both bilateral and multilateral aid, with the aid usually administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The organisational name of Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) is often used, in particular when operating bilateral aid.
Military

Denmark's armed forces are known as the Danish Defence (Danish: Forsvaret). The Minister of Defence is commander-in-chief of the Danish Defence, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad. During peacetime, the Ministry of Defence employs around 33,000 in total. The main military branches employ almost 27,000: 15,460 in the Royal Danish Army, 5,300 in the Royal Danish Navy and 6,050 in the Royal Danish Air Force (all including conscripts).[citation needed] The Danish Emergency Management Agency employs 2,000 (including conscripts), and about 4,000 are in non-branch-specific services like the Danish Defence Command and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service. Furthermore, around 55,000 serve as volunteers in the Danish Home Guard.
Denmark is a long-time supporter of international peacekeeping, but since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the War in Afghanistan in 2001, Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation, participating actively in several wars and invasions. This relatively new situation has stirred some internal critique, but the Danish population has generally been very supportive, in particular of the War in Afghanistan.[96][97] The Danish Defence has around 1,400[98] staff in international missions, not including standing contributions to NATO SNMCMG1. Danish forces were heavily engaged in the former Yugoslavia in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), with IFOR,[99] and now SFOR.[100] Between 2003 and 2007, there were approximately 450 Danish soldiers in Iraq.[101] Denmark also strongly supported American operations in Afghanistan and has contributed both monetarily and materially to the ISAF.[102] These initiatives are often described by the authorities as part of a new "active foreign policy" of Denmark.

Denmark has a developed mixed economy that is classed as a high-income economy by the World Bank.[103] It ranks 18th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 6th in nominal GDP per capita.[104][105] Denmark's economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World.[106][107] It is the 13th most competitive economy in the world, and 8th in Europe, according to the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015.[108]
Denmark has the fourth highest ratio of tertiary degree holders in the world.[109] The country ranks highest in the world for workers' rights.[110] GDP per hour worked was the 13th highest in 2009. The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average,[111][112] but after public cash transfers the income inequality is very low. According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world's highest minimum wage.[113] As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, as the result of a collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group Horesta, workers at McDonald's and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to five weeks' paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan.[114] Union density in 2015 was 68%.[115]




Denmark is a leading producer of pork, and the largest exporter of pork products in the EU.[116]


Once a predominantly agricultural country on account of its arable landscape, since 1945 Denmark has greatly expanded its industrial base so that by 2006 industry contributed about 25% of GDP and agriculture less than 2%.[117] Major industries include iron, steel, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding and construction.[60] The country's main exports are: industrial production/manufactured goods 73.3% (of which machinery and instruments were 21.4%, and fuels (oil, natural gas), chemicals, etc. 26%); agricultural products and others for consumption 18.7% (in 2009 meat and meat products were 5.5% of total export; fish and fish products 2.9%).[60] Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and has for a number of years had a balance of payments surplus while battling an equivalent of approximately 39% of GNP foreign debt or more than DKK 300 billion.[118]




Denmark is a member of the European Single Market


A liberalisation of import tariffs in 1797 marked the end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s.[119] Even when other countries, such as Germany and France, raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870, Denmark retained its free trade policies, as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals (used as feedstuffs for their cattle and pigs) and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable.[120] Today, Denmark is part of the European Union's internal market, which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Support for free trade is high among the Danish public; in a 2007 poll 76% responded that globalisation is a good thing.[121] 70% of trade flows are inside the European Union. As of 2014[update], Denmark's largest export partners are Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway.[60]
Denmark's currency, the krone (DKK), is pegged at approximately 7.46 kroner per euro through the ERM. Although a September 2000 referendum rejected adopting the euro,[122] the country follows the policies set forth in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and meets the economic convergence criteria needed to adopt the euro. The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support adopting the euro, but as yet a new referendum has not been held, despite plans;[123] scepticism of the EU among Danish voters has historically been strong.
Denmark is home to many multinational companies, among them: A.P. Møller-Mærsk (international shipping), Arla Foods (dairy), Lego Group (toys), Danfoss (industrial services), Carlsberg Group (beer), Vestas (wind turbines), and the pharmaceutical companies Leo Pharma and Novo Nordisk.[124]

With an investment of 8.5 million euros over the ten-year construction period, Denmark confirms participation in E-ELT.[125]


Denmark has a long tradition of scientific and technological invention and engagement, and has been involved internationally from the very start of the scientific revolution. In current times, Denmark is participating in many high-profile international science and technology projects, including CERN, ITER, ESA, ISS and E-ELT.
In the 20th century, Danes have also been innovative in several fields of the technology sector. Danish companies have been influential in the shipping industry with the design of the largest and most energy efficient container ships in the world, the Maersk Triple E class, and Danish engineers have contributed to the design of MAN Diesel engines. In the software and electronic field, Denmark contributed to design and manufacturing of Nordic Mobile Telephones, and the now-defunct Danish company DanCall was among the first to develop GSM mobile phones.
Life science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing diabetes care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish biotech company Novozymes, the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch based bioethanol, has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to cellulosic ethanol.[126] Medicon Valley, spanning the Øresund Region between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe's largest life science clusters, containing a large number of life science companies and research institutions located within a very small geographical area.
Danish-born computer scientists and software engineers have taken leading roles in some of the world's programming languages: Anders Hejlsberg (Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#); Rasmus Lerdorf (PHP); Bjarne Stroustrup (C++); David Heinemeier Hansson (Ruby on Rails); Lars Bak, a pioneer in virtual machines (V8, Java VM, Dart). Physicist Lene Vestergaard Hau is the first person to stop light, leading to advances in quantum computing, nanoscale engineering and linear optics.
Public policy
See also: Flexicurity and Taxation in Denmark
Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the Danish economy is characterised by extensive government welfare provisions. Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection.[127] As a result of its acclaimed "flexicurity" model, Denmark has the most free labour market in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, unemployment compensation is very high (security).[128] Establishing a business can be done in a matter of hours and at very low costs.[129] No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.[128] Denmark has a competitive corporate tax rate of 24.5% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates.[130] The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% value-added tax, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) is estimated to be 46% in 2011.[131]
As of 2014[update], 6% of the population was reported to live below the poverty line, when adjusted for taxes and transfers. Denmark has the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the OECD, below the 11.3% OECD average.[132] The share of the population reporting that they feel that they cannot afford to buy sufficient food in Denmark is less than half of the OECD average.[132] With an employment rate of 72.8%, Denmark ranks 7th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 66.2%.[132] The number of unemployed people is forecast to be 65,000 in 2015.[133] The number of people in the working age group, less disability pensioners etc., will grow by 10,000 to 2,860,000, and jobs by 70,000 to 2,790,000;[133] part-time jobs are included.[134] Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour, for instance for factory and service jobs, including hospital nurses and physicians, the annual average working hours have risen, especially compared with the recession 1987–1993.[135] Increasingly, service workers of all kinds are in demand, i.e. in the postal services and as bus drivers, and academics.[136]
The level of unemployment benefits is dependent on former employment (the maximum benefit is at 90% of the wage) and at times also on membership of an unemployment fund, which is almost always—but need not be—administered by a trade union, and the previous payment of contributions. However, the largest share of the financing is still carried by the central government and is financed by general taxation, and only to a minor degree from earmarked contributions. There is no taxation, however, on proceeds gained from selling one's home (provided there was any home equity (friværdi)), as the marginal tax rate on capital income from housing savings is around 0%.[137]

Denmark has considerably large deposits of oil and natural gas in the North Sea and ranks as number 32 in the world among net exporters of crude oil[138] and was producing 259,980 barrels of crude oil a day in 2009.[139] Denmark is a long-time leader in wind power: In 2015 wind turbines provided 42.1% of the total electricity power consumption.[140] in May 2011[update] Denmark derived 3.1% of its gross domestic product from renewable (clean) energy technology and energy efficiency, or around €6.5 billion ($9.4 billion).[141] Denmark is connected by electric transmission lines to other European countries. On 6 September 2012, Denmark launched the biggest wind turbine in the world, and will add four more over the next four years.[needs update]Denmark's electricity sector has integrated energy sources such as wind power into the national grid. Denmark now aims to focus on intelligent battery systems (V2G) and plug-in vehicles in the transport sector.[142] The country is a member nation of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).[143]

Great Belt Fixed Link, The East Bridge as seen from Zealand.


Significant investment has been made in building road and rail links between regions in Denmark, most notably the Great Belt Fixed Link, which connects Zealand and Funen. It is now possible to drive from Frederikshavn in northern Jutland to Copenhagen on eastern Zealand without leaving the motorway. The main railway operator is DSB for passenger services and DB Schenker Rail for freight trains. The railway tracks are maintained by Banedanmark. The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are intertwined by various, international ferry links. Construction of the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, connecting Denmark and Germany with a second link, will start in 2015.[144] Copenhagen has a rapid transit system, the Copenhagen Metro, and an extensive electrified suburban railway network, the S-train. In the four largest cities – Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg – light rail systems are planned to be in operation around 2020.[145]




Copenhagen Airport is the largest airport in Scandinavia and 15th-busiest in Europe.[146]


With Norway and Sweden, Denmark is part of the Scandinavian Airlines flag carrier. Copenhagen Airport is Scandinavia's busiest passenger airport, handling over 25 million passengers in 2014.[146] Other notable airports are Billund Airport, Aalborg Airport, and Aarhus Airport.
Cycling in Denmark is a common form of transport, particularly for the young and for city dwellers. With a network of bicycle routes extending more than 12,000 km[147] and an estimated 7,000 km[148] of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes, Denmark has a solid bicycle infrastructure.
Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the high registration tax (150%), VAT (25%), and one of the world's highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership. In 2007, an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles. However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars,[149] as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes. As of 2011[update], the average car age is 9.2 years.[150]

The population of Denmark, as defined by Statistics Denmark, was estimated in January 2017[update] to be 5,748,769.[4] The median age is 41.4 years, with 0.97 males per female. The total fertility rate is 1.73 children born per woman; despite the low birth rate, the population is still growing at an average annual rate of 0.22%.[60] Notably, very few Down Syndrome children are born in Denmark, with 98% of DS pregnancies aborted in 2014.[151] The World Happiness Report frequently ranks Denmark's population as the happiest in the world.[152][153][154] This has been attributed to the country's highly regarded education and health care systems,[155] and its low level of income inequality.[6]
Denmark is an historically homogeneous nation. However, as with its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark has recently transformed from a nation of net emigration, up until World War II, to a nation of net immigration. Today, immigration to Denmark consists particularly of asylum seekers and persons who arrive as family dependants.[156] In addition, Denmark annually receives a number of citizens from Western countries, notably Nordic countries, the EU, and North America, who seek residency to work or study for a definite period of time. Recently, substantial numbers of workers—several tens of thousands—from the new EU accession countries, especially Poland and the Baltic nations, have arrived to perform menial labour in construction, agriculture, consumer industries, and cleaning.[156] Overall, the net migration rate in 2015 was 2.2 migrant(s)/1,000 population, comparable to the United Kingdom and well below other North European countries, except the Baltic states.[60][157][158]
There are no official statistics on ethnic groups, but according to 2016 figures from Statistics Denmark, approximately 87.7% of the population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship.[4][N 4] The remaining 12.3% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants or descendants of recent immigrants. With the same definition, the most common countries of origin were Poland, Turkey, Germany, Iraq, Romania, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia and its successor states.[4]

Languages
Main article: Languages of Denmark
Danish is the de facto national language of Denmark.[159] Faroese and Greenlandic are the official languages of the Faroe Islands and Greenland respectively.[159] German is a recognised minority language in the area of the former South Jutland County (now part of the Region of Southern Denmark), which was part of the German Empire prior to the Treaty of Versailles.[159] Danish and Faroese belong to the North Germanic (Nordic) branch of the Indo-European languages, along with Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish.[160] The languages are so closely related that it is possible for Danish, Norwegian and Swedish speakers to understand each other with relatively little effort, citation needed. Danish is more distantly related to German, which is a West Germanic language. Greenlandic or "Kalaallisut" belongs to the Eskimo–Aleut languages; it is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada, such as Inuktitut, and entirely unrelated to Danish.[160]
A large majority (86%) of Danes speak English as a second language,[161] generally with a high level of proficiency. German is the second-most spoken foreign language, with 47% reporting a conversational level of proficiency.[159] Denmark had 25,900 native speakers of German in 2007 (mostly in the South Jutland area).[159]
Religion
Main article: Religion in Denmark
Christianity is the dominant religion in Denmark, especially in its Lutheran form. In January 2017, 75.9%[162] of the population of Denmark were members of the Church of Denmark (Den Danske Folkekirke), the officially established church, which is Protestant in classification and Lutheran in orientation.[163][N 15] This is down 1.0% compared to the year earlier and 1.9% down compared to two years earlier. Despite the high membership figures, only 3% of the population regularly attend Sunday services[164][165] and only 19% of Danes consider religion to be an important part of their life.[166] Baptism in a Christian church ensures automatic membership of the Christian church, unless manually leaving the church anytime after the person in question has turned 18 years of age. Membership of the church also incur paying church taxes.[167]

Roskilde Cathedral has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century. In 1995 it became a World Heritage Site.


The Constitution states that a member of the Royal Family must be a member of the Church of Denmark, though the rest of the population is free to adhere to other faiths.[169][170][171] In 1682 the state granted limited recognition to three religious groups dissenting from the Established Church: Roman Catholicism, the Reformed Church and Judaism,[171] although conversion to these groups from the Church of Denmark remained illegal initially. Until the 1970s, the state formally recognised "religious societies" by royal decree. Today, religious groups do not need official government recognition, they can be granted the right to perform weddings and other ceremonies without this recognition.[171] Denmark's Muslims make up approximately 3.7% of the population and form the country's second largest religious community and largest minority religion.[164][172] The Danish Foreign Ministry estimates that other religious groups comprise less than 1% of the population individually and approximately 2% when taken all together.[173]
According to a 2010 Eurobarometer Poll,[174] 28% of Danish citizens polled responded that they "believe there is a God", 47% responded that they "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 24% responded that they "do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force". Another poll, carried out in 2009, found that 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.[175]

All educational programmes in Denmark are regulated by the Ministry of Education and administered by local municipalities. Folkeskole covers the entire period of compulsory education, encompassing primary and lower secondary education.[176] Most children attend folkeskole for 10 years, from the ages of 6 to 16. There are no final examinations, but pupils can choose to go to a test when finishing ninth grade (14–15 years old). The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended. Pupils can alternatively attend an independent school (friskole), or a private school (privatskole), such as Christian schools or Waldorf schools.
Following graduation from compulsory education, there are several continuing educational opportunities; the Gymnasium (STX) attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science, Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) focuses on scientific subjects and the Higher Commercial Examination Programme emphasises on subjects in economics. Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) is similar to Gymnasium (STX), but is one year shorter. For specific professions, there is vocational education, training young people for work in specific trades by a combination of teaching and apprenticeship.
The government records upper secondary school completion rates of 95% and tertiary enrollment and completion rates of 60%.[177] All university and college (tertiary) education in Denmark is free of charges; there are no tuition fees to enrol in courses. Students aged 18 or above may apply for state educational support grants, known as Statens Uddannelsesstøtte (SU) which provides fixed financial support, disbursed monthly.[178] Danish universities offer international students a range of opportunities for obtaining an internationally recognised qualification in Denmark. Many programmes may be taught in the English language, the academic lingua franca, in bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, doctorates and student exchange programmes.[179]
Health
See also: Health care in Denmark
As of 2012[update], Denmark has a life expectancy of 79.5 years at birth (77 for men, 82 for women), up from 75 years in 1990.[180] This ranks it 37th among 193 nations, behind the other Nordic countries. The National Institute of Public Health of the University of Southern Denmark has calculated 19 major risk factors among Danes that contribute to a lowering of the life expectancy; this includes smoking, alcohol, drug abuse and physical inactivity.[181] The large number of Danes becoming overweight is an increasing problem and results in an annual additional consumption in the health care system of DKK 1,625 million.[181] In a 2012 study, Denmark had the highest cancer rate of all countries listed by the World Cancer Research Fund International; researchers suggest the reasons are better reporting, but also lifestyle factors like heavy alcohol consumption, smoking and physical inactivity.[182][183]
Denmark has a universal health care system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, for most of the services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income is a national health care contribution (sundhedsbidrag) (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it is being phased out and will be gone from January 2019, with the income taxes in the lower brackets being raised gradually each year instead.[14] Another source comes from the municipalities which had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007, a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead. This means that most health care provision is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as physiotherapy.[184] As of 2012[update], Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita).[184] This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries.[184][185]
Culture
Main article: Culture of Denmark
See also: LGBT rights in Denmark
Denmark shares strong cultural and historic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours Sweden and Norway. It has historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in the world. In 1969, Denmark was the first country to legalise pornography,[186] and in 2012, Denmark replaced its "registered partnership" laws, which it had been the first country to introduce in 1989,[187][188] with gender-neutral marriage.[189][190] Modesty and social equality are important parts of Danish culture,[191] so much so that, 'success' or what may be seen as a deliberate attempt to distinguish oneself from others may be viewed with hostility. This characteristic is called Janteloven or Law of Jante by Danes.[192]




Statue of philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.


The astronomical discoveries of Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Ludwig A. Colding's (1815–88) neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962) indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55), the short stories of Karen Blixen (penname Isak Dinesen), (1885–1962), the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein (1905–96), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars von Trier.
A major feature of Danish culture is Jul (Danish Christmas). The holiday is celebrated throughout December, starting either at the beginning of Advent or on 1 December with a variety of traditions, culminating with the Christmas Eve meal.
There are five Danish heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in Northern Europe: Christiansfeld, a Moravian Church Settlement, the Jelling Mounds (Runic Stones and Church), Kronborg Castle, Roskilde Cathedral, and The par force hunting landscape in North Zealand.[193]
Media
Main articles: Cinema of Denmark and Television in Denmark
Danish mass media date back to the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, Anders Bording, the father of Danish journalism, began a state paper. In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting freedom of the press in Denmark. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or trade union. Modernisation, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925.[194] The German occupation during World War II brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis. During the war, the underground produced 550 newspapers—small, surreptitiously printed sheets that encouraged sabotage and resistance.[194]




Director Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme film movement.


Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the state-supported Danish Film Institute. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the silent era; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the Dogme 95 movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors of early cinema.[195][196]
Other Danish filmmakers of note include Erik Balling, the creator of the popular Olsen-banden films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for Babette's Feast in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, Palme d'Or- and Golden Globe-winner for Pelle the Conqueror in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme movement, and multiple award-winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn. Mads Mikkelsen is a world-renowned Danish actor, having starred in films such as King Arthur, Casino Royale, the Danish film The Hunt, and the American TV series Hannibal. Another renowned Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is internationally known for playing the role of Jaime Lannister in the critically acclaimed HBO series Game of Thrones.
Danish mass media and news programming are dominated by a few large corporations. In printed media JP/Politikens Hus and Berlingske Media, between them, control the largest newspapers Politiken, Berlingske Tidende and Jyllands-Posten and major tabloids B.T. and Ekstra Bladet. In television, publicly owned stations DR and TV 2 have large shares of the viewers.[197] DR in particular is famous for its high quality TV-series often sold to foreign broadcasters and often with strong leading female characters like internationally known actresses Sidse Babett Knudsen and Sofie Gråbøl. In radio, DR has a near monopoly, currently broadcasting on all four nationally available FM channels, competing only with local stations.[198]

Copenhagen and its multiple outlying islands have a wide range of folk traditions. The Royal Danish Orchestra is among the world's oldest orchestras.[199] Denmark's most famous classical composer is Carl Nielsen, especially remembered for his six symphonies and his Wind Quintet, while the Royal Danish Ballet specialises in the work of the Danish choreographer August Bournonville. Danes have distinguished themselves as jazz musicians, and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation. The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of note internationally, including MØ, Aqua, Lukas Graham, D-A-D, Oh Land, The Raveonettes, Michael Learns to Rock, King Diamond, Alphabeat, Kashmir, Mew and Volbeat, among others. Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band Metallica, has become the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Roskilde Festival near Copenhagen is the largest music festival in Northern Europe since 1971 and Denmark has many recurring music festivals of all genres throughout, including Aarhus International Jazz Festival, Skanderborg Festival, The Blue Festival in Aalborg, Esbjerg International Chamber Music Festival and Skagen Festival among many others.[200][201]
Architecture and design

Grundtvig's Church in Copenhagen. An example of expressionist architecture.


Denmark's architecture became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style. During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the Baroque style, both in the capital and the provinces. Neoclassicism from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th-century National Romantic style.[202]
The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including expressionism, best exemplified by the designs of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and Nordic Classicism, which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsen's Grande Arche de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.[203]
Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in the mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The Royal Porcelain Factory is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen, Finn Juhl, Hans Wegner, Arne Jacobsen, Poul Henningsen and Verner Panton.[204] Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Quistgaard (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements and Ole Wanscher (1903–1985) who had a classical approach to furniture design.

The first known Danish literature is myths and folklore from the 10th and 11th century. Saxo Grammaticus, normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop Absalon on a chronicle of Danish history (Gesta Danorum). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the Middle Ages. With the Age of Enlightenment came Ludvig Holberg whose comedy plays are still being performed.
In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the Modern Breakthrough, this movement was championed by Georg Brandes, Henrik Pontoppidan (awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature) and J. P. Jacobsen. Romanticism influenced the renowned writer and poet Hans Christian Andersen, known for his stories and fairy tales, e.g. The Ugly Duckling, The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen. In recent history Johannes Vilhelm Jensen was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Karen Blixen is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are Herman Bang, Gustav Wied, William Heinesen, Martin Andersen Nexø, Piet Hein, Hans Scherfig, Klaus Rifbjerg, Dan Turèll, Tove Ditlevsen, Inger Christensen and Peter Høeg.
Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of Western philosophy. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard, the creator of Christian existentialism. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including Harald Høffding, who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include Jean-Paul Sartre who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and Rollo May, who helped create humanistic psychology. Another Danish philosopher of note is Grundtvig, whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

Woman in front of a Mirror, (1841), by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg


While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th- and 16th-century church frescos, which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.[205]
The Danish Golden Age, which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism, typified in the later previous century by history painter Nicolai Abildgaard. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included notable painters such as Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand.
In 1871, Holger Drachmann and Karl Madsen visited Skagen in the far north of Jutland where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful artists' colonies specialising in Naturalism and Realism rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy. Hosted by Michael and his wife Anna, they were soon joined by P.S. Krøyer, Carl Locher and Laurits Tuxen. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people.[206] Similar trends developed on Funen with the Fynboerne who included Johannes Larsen, Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen,[207] and on the island of Bornholm with the Bornholm school of painters including Niels Lergaard, Kræsten Iversen and Oluf Høst.[208]
Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909–1912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (1948–51), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), De Unge Vilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Sørensen (1899–1985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (1907–1993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (1912–1993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (1913–2007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bjørn Wiinblad (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).
Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art of photography in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.[209]
Cuisine

Smørrebrød – a variety of Danish open sandwiches piled high with delicacies.


The traditional cuisine of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of Northern Germany, consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.
The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls of veal and pork) and hakkebøf (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) and kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters.
Since around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced gourmet cooking, largely influenced by French cuisine. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as New Danish cuisine.[210] As a result of these developments, Denmark now have a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded Michelin stars. This includes Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen.

Michael Laudrup, named the best Danish soccer player of all time by the Danish Football Association.


Sports are popular in Denmark, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. The national sport is football (soccer), with over 320,000 players in more than 1600 clubs.[211] Denmark qualified six times consecutively for the European Championships between 1984 and 2004, and were crowned European champions in 1992; other significant achievements include winning the Confederations Cup in 1995 and reaching the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup. Notable Danish footballers include Allan Simonsen, named the best player in Europe in 1977, Peter Schmeichel, named the "World's Best Goalkeeper" in 1992 and 1993, and Michael Laudrup, named the best Danish player of all time by the Danish Football Association.[212]
There is much focus on handball, too. The women's national team celebrated great successes during the 1990s. On the men's side, Denmark has won eight medals—two gold (in 2008 and 2012), three silver (in 2011, 2013 and 2014) and three bronze (in 2002, 2004 and 2006)—the most that have been won by any team in European Handball Championship history.[213]
In recent years, Denmark has made a mark as a strong cycling nation, with Michael Rasmussen reaching King of the Mountains status in the Tour de France in 2005 and 2006. Other popular sports include golf—which is mostly popular among those in the older demographic;[214] tennis—in which Denmark is successful on a professional level; basketball—Denmark joined the international governing body FIBA in 1951;[215] rugby—the Danish Rugby Union dates back to 1950;[216] hockey— often competing in the top division in the Men's World Championships; rowing—Denmark specialise in lightweight rowing and are particularly known for their lightweight coxless four, having won six gold and two silver World Championship medals and three gold and two bronze Olympic medals; and several indoor sports—especially badminton, table tennis and gymnastics, in each of which Denmark holds World Championships and Olympic medals. Denmark's numerous beaches and resorts are popular locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and many other water-themed sports.

Notes


^ Kong Christian has equal status as a national anthem but is generally used only on royal and military occasions.[1]
^ a b c d The Kingdom of Denmark's territory in continental Europe is referred to as "Denmark proper" (Danish: egentlig Danmark), "metropolitan Denmark",[43] or simply Denmark. In this article, usage of "Denmark" excludes Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
^ The Faroe Islands became the first territory to be granted home rule on 24 March 1948. Greenland also gained autonomy on 1 May 1979.
^ a b c This data is for Denmark proper only. For data relevant to Greenland and the Faroe Islands see their respective articles.
^ In the Faroe Islands the currency has a separate design and is known as the króna, but is not a separate currency.
^ The Faroe Islands (+298) and Greenland (+299) have their own country calling codes.
^ The TLD .eu is shared with other European Union countries. Greenland (.gl) and the Faroe Islands (.fo) have their own TLDs.
^ Danish: Kongeriget Danmark, [ˈkɔŋəʁiːəð ˈdanmɑɡ] ( listen). See also: Danish Realm
^ The island of Bornholm is offset to the east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea.
^ Denmark has a codified constitution. Changes to it require an absolute majority in two consecutive parliamentary terms and the approval of at least 40% of the electorate through a referendum.[79]
^ The Constitution refers to "the King" (Danish: Kong), rather than the gender-neutral term "Monarch". In light of the restriction of powers of the Monarchy, this is best interpreted as referring to the government Cabinet.
^ The Economist Intelligence Unit, while acknowledging that democracy is difficult to measure, listed Denmark 5th on its index of democracy.[9]
^ The Faroese declined membership in 1973; Greenland chose to leave the EEC in 1985, following a referendum.
^ As measured in official development assistance (ODA). Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom exceeded the United Nations' ODA target of 0.7% of GNI.
^ The Church of Denmark is the established church (or state religion) in Denmark and Greenland; the Church of the Faroe Islands became an independent body in 2007.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI love this Biotin!BySarah E Lenssenon July 12, 2016Size: 100ct Max-StrengthI was having some serious hair loss issues. I would get out of the shower and brush my hair and so much would fall out. It was very upsetting. My brush, after just one brushing, would look like I hadn't cleaned it in six months - that's how much hair I was losing. Then I found Natrol Biotin and started using it with Pronexa by HairGenics - Clinical Strength Hair Growth & Regrowth Shampoo With Biotin – after about 6 weeks, I noticed a huge difference in my hair. Much, much less hair falling out when brushing, overall healthier, thicker hair, and I am so happy that I was able to stop and reverse my hair loss issue. Definitely use these products to stop thinning hair in its tracks.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsPlease don't take if your acne prone!!ByElla girlon January 6, 2016Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseSo I'm a big fan of vitamins... I was excited to find this particular bottle of biotin. Took it religiously for  months. Well I broke out horribly!! I mean disgustingly! Like I've never have before. In an attempt to stop the ongoing break outs I changed the way I eat, I gave up chocolate, coffee, 80% of my vitamins.. No change. Then one day I did research on biotin. According to many articles big amounts of biotin will cause break outs for some people. I was horrified! Took this bottle and threw it away! I'm still trying to get my skin back. Biotin works yes, but this particular extra strength might be too much for some people. As far as my personal experience I must give this a one star. And hopefully I save someone some headaches. This acne has ruined my self esteem. I've had a pimple here and there before but never this bad and it was hell trying to figure out what was causing it. Also my little sister was taking them, and breaking out too (not as bad as me, but the worst she's ever had too) as soon as I did my research I ran to tell her. She has also informed me that her break outs aren't as bad anymore, since taking this pills off her daily routine. So it really wasn't just me having this effects. I now take an acne medication orally (pills) and in the ingredients it actually  contains biotin, it has 300 mcg that's a big difference from 10,000 mcg!!! I mean look at the diffrence! Obviously this might work for some people but it ruined my skin. Do your research before taking any type of pills, always read the back of the bottles. It could have saved me from running my face for so many months :(Read more

Even if you're forgetfulByAmazon Customeron November 3, 2016Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseI am the most forgetful person and have only been taking these 2-3 times a week and STILL noticed a difference. My hair has become stronger, softer and noticeably longer after just 3 weeks!  I did not experience any acne symptoms like many reviews have said but I do think it made my skin a bit oilier than usual but nothing too noticeable! Love this productRead more

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsBeware the acneByEbsaon June 14, 2017Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseBe very careful using this product. While Biotin is good for you, excessive Biotin can limit the absorption of other B vitamins. I took this to help my hair grow back, and I immediately broke out with a horrible case of acne all over my face. Apparently, that's a pretty common reaction for alot of people (although some people are able to take large doses of this and not have any issues). I recommend trying a small dosage first, then slowly upping your intake. 10,000 mcg is alot to start with, you guys.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWhich is great, I take them in the morningByBella B.on July 16, 2017Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseThis seemed to give me about half an inch of hair growth in around three weeks.  Nail growth seems normal,  but they grow fast without it,  so that is hard to gauge. My only complaint would be more energy with these.  Which is great,  I take them in  the morning,  but they still sometimes keep me awake when it's time for bed. That can be annoying as I generally don't have any issues falling sleep normally.  No breakouts,  I drink a lot of water,  no nausea. Seems a decent product with good results,  don't expect to have nails and hair grow inches and inches in a week,  but over several months it can help.On a side note,  I'm prone to headaches and I've gotten a lot after the first week.  Unsure if it is related,  but something to consider,  maybe half a pill instead.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGet it!!BySunnyon December 4, 2016Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseI got these and was skeptical they would work, but after taking them for the past 2 months, my hair has grown out healthy and long at a much faster pace than it usually does. I definitely recommend it. It's worth investing in these vitamins. They don't taste like anything either and the tablet is about the size of a tic tac. I definitely recommend this product.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGreat for hair lossByAlexison April 13, 2016Size: 100ct Max-Strength|Verified PurchaseI started taking this a little over 3 weeks ago for my hair growth (I just had a baby and those of you with kids know you loose a LOT of hair after pregnancy) and nail growth. It doesn't seem to be do too much so far, but I have noticed a little bit of difference in my hair loss. It's not as significant as usual. I am maybe loosing half as much hair as before (I used to loose half a handful in the shower and now maybe lose 10-15 noticeable strands each shower). As for my nails, I haven't seen any difference at all. They are still very brittle and grow at a slow rate. Hopefully I see some more improvements soon and if I do I will come back and update my review (:Read more11 comment|
