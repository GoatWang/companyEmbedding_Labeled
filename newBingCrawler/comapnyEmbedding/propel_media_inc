Propel Media, Inc.
The Propel Media, Inc. brand was developed into a colorful and bold experience as it merged two growing online advertising companies into one unified tech brand. 














Logo Colorful, bold and unified. The logo needed to possess all the dynamic parts of two merging media giants. The colors represent the individual products and brands that this company is built on while the symbol evokes the sense of movement, growth and unity.  Below demonstrates some of the avenues that were taken during the brainstorm phase and through its evolution in the final selection. 











Branding When developing the look and feel of the logo application we wanted to utilize a black and white duality to create a confident and bold look while flecking in the brand colors as an accent to draw the eye into hot points and call to actions across web and print collateral. 











Logo Introduction Video This animation flow shows the fusion of the two companies along with its ideas, products and people to form a unified brand.

Propel Media Delivers Improved Third Quarter Profitability

Revenues of $19.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million
Profitability driven by strong growth in Company’s owned and operated user audience
Investments in key video and native advertising initiatives positions Propel Media for growth

JERSEY CITY, N.J., Nov. 12, 2015 – Propel Media, Inc. (OTCBB: PROM), a performance focused digital media company bringing together online video, display and mobile advertising technology and solutions to advertisers, app developers and publishers, announced that it achieved revenue of $19.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million in its 2015 third quarter.
“Propel Media’s profitability was up significantly over Q2 2015 due to our ability to improve advertiser performance metrics,” said Bob Regular, Propel Media’s Chief Executive Officer. “We also are pleased that our margins improved dramatically over Q2 as a result of contributions from new native ad products introduced last quarter and from improved performance from our expanded owned and operated audience network,” Mr. Regular added.
Third Quarter Business Highlights:

United States owned and operated (“O&O”) audience base expansion – Media buying activities to expand the Company’s O&O audience base was key to profit expansion
Enhanced data optimization and audience targeting attributed to improved advertiser performance metrics.
New Product Monetization – Contextual native ad formats introduced in Q2 2015 contributed meaningful revenues and margins in Q3 2015

“We have been pleased to see our advertisers meeting their ROI goals by advertising with Propel Media. We see that satisfying the advertising metrics of our advertisers as essential to driving our long-term success,” said Marv Tseu, Propel Media President. “We are very pleased that in Q3 2015 we expanded our owned and operated audience network. This enhanced audience network provides improved performance for our advertisers which, along with enhanced data optimization and audience targeting provided us with gross profit improvements over Q2 of 2015,” said Mr. Tseu.
Further details concerning the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are contained in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that Propel Media filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain information and statements contained in this press release, including those regarding Propel Media’s capital structure, ability to execute its operating plan, anticipated financial flexibility and other statements that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates”, “expects,” “will” or comparable terms or the negative thereof. Such statements are based on management’s current estimates, assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to update any such statements to reflect subsequent changes in events or circumstances. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of events, factors and conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Propel Media and not all of which are known to Propel Media, including, without limitation those risk factors described from time to time in Propel Media’s reports filed with the SEC.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are Propel Media’s: loss of key advertising customers; inability to acquire new advertising customers; inability to expand its video content library; inability to protect its intellectual property; inability to comply with the covenants in its credit facility; inability to obtain necessary financing or enter into equity arrangements with existing or new institutional shareholders; inability to execute its acquisition strategy; inability to effectively manage its growth; failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired businesses; competition; loss of key personnel; increases in costs of operations; continued compliance with government regulations; and general economic conditions.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Propel Media reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP financial measure. Propel Media calculates Adjusted EBITDA by taking net income and adding back depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit, interest expense and stock-based compensation.
Propel Media uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Propel Media believes that these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results and guidance prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the table following the financial statements attached to this press release.
