About MedaMeda is a leading international specialty pharma company with a broad product portfolio reaching more than 80% of the global pharmaceutical market. Sales at the end of 2015 amounted to more than SEK 19,6 billion. At the end of 2015 Meda had around 4,600 (5,200) employees, 2,690 (2,900) of which worked in sales and marketing. The company’s main focus is sales and marketing and Meda has its own sales organizations in more than 60 countries. Sales and marketing activities are carried out via distributors in countries where Meda has no representation and globally Meda’s products are sold in more than 150 countries. Over the past few years Meda’s presence in growth markets has grown. The marketing organizations in these markets employ about 1,100 people (1,083). In 2014 Meda acquired the Italian specialty pharma company Rottapharm and after the acquisition, around 60% of Meda’s product sales are in the prescription area (Rx) and around 40% are in non-prescription (Cx and OTC). Meda has a broad product portfolio but there are three key therapy areas – Respiratory, Dermatology and Pain and Inflammation – accounting for around 50% of company sales.Meda does not conduct any, early-stage pharmaceutical development. New products are secured through acquisitions. Instead, Meda is focused on market-adapted product development in key therapy areas, and sales and marketing. Rx products are prescription based pharmaceuticals prescribed by doctors and therapists for patients.
OTC products are over the counter products sold directly to consumers via pharmacies and retail chains.
Cx are clinically-proven consumer healthcare products recommended by doctors and pharmacists to consumers.

Stillfront Group AB: Stillfront acquires German sports management game OFM and enters publishing agreement on Football Empire
2017-07-18
PRESS RELEASE  18 July 2017

Stillfront acquires German sports management game OFM and enters publishing agreement on Football Empire
Today's agreements on the acquisition of German sports management game OFM, and the publishing agreement with Digamore Entertainment GmbH on Football Empire, is another step in Stillfront's strategy to build a diversified portfolio of studios and products, and to increase the share of own IPs and self-publishing.
Stillfront Group AB (publ) today announces the acquisition of 51% of the business OnlineFussballManager.de ("OFM") through a so-called Asset Purchase. The seller is OnlineFussballManager GmbH. The business will be conducted in the newly formed legal entity OFM Studios GmbH, which is 51% owned by Stillfront Group AB through a wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition price paid by OFM Studios GmbH for assets related to OFM is 639 KEUR (cash / debt free). Stillfront Group will issue a loan to OFM Studios GmbH for the financing of the acquisition. OFM will be consolidated into Stillfront's consolidated financial reporting from July 2017.
The OFM business is operated from Cologne, Germany, and was founded 2006 by Maik Dokter, who also owns the remaining 49% of OFM Studios GmbH. OFM is a very well-established brand within the genre football manager games, with a long history of solid revenues and results, and with a large loyal user base. The game has won several awards during the years, amongst others the MMO of the year 2012 and 2013. The game is browser based and appr. 40% is consumed through mobile. OFM is operated by three persons and had revenues 2016 of 1.1 MEUR, with appr 50% operational margin. Revenues and marginal has been very stable on similar levels during first half of 2017. OFM Studios GmbH will be reported as an integral part of Stillfront's other business within sports management games, which today consists of Power Challenge.
Stillfront today also entered a co-publishing deal with Digamore Entertainment GmbH, founded and managed by Maik Dokter, regarding the native mobile game Football Empire, currently in the final stages of development. Football Empire is a unique combination of a football manager game and a so-called builder strategy game. The game is planned to be launched at the end of 2017. Digamore Entertainment GmbH, with fully owned subsidiary Football Empire Studios UG, owns the full IP to the game Football Empire. The impact on Stillfront Group's operational financial result (EBTIDA) is expected to be marginal during 2017.
Stillfront has an option to acquire 51% of all outstanding shares in Digamore Entertainment GmbH with the subsidiary Football Empire Studios UG, on a valuation of 3 MEUR. If the option is used, the acquisition is planned to be financed by a combination of cash and newly issued Stillfront Group shares.
Jörgen Larsson, CEO, Stillfront Group, comments:"Our determined and long-term efforts to create a diversified portfolio of studios and games, has paid off through solid financial performance. The newly issued corporate bond secures financial resources for continued profitable growth, both organically, through acquisitions of exciting businesses and entering publishing agreements. OFM's strong position constitutes a significant addition to our offer within sports management games. We believe Football Empire, as a high-quality native mobile games product, has great potential for success, and we are very enthusiastic that Maik Dokter, a proven skilled and passionate entrepreneur is joining the Stillfront family".
Maik Dokter, Founder and CEO, OFM and Digamore, comments:"I am enthusiastic about that OFM and Football Empire are being connected to Stillfront. We share the same objectives and vision, and I am convinced that Stillfront's proven ability to develop businesses and publish products will lead to significant successes."

Stillfront Group AB: Stillfront approved for listing on Nasdaq First North Premier
2017-06-28
PRESS RELEASE June 28, 2017

Stillfront approved for listing on Nasdaq First North Premier
Nasdaq has approved Stillfront Group's application for listing on Nasdaq First North Premier. The requirements for a listing on Nasdaq First North Premier are more extensive than those of the list that Stillfront Group currently is listed on, and in line with the stricter rules applicable on the regulated market, main market at Nasdaq Stockholm.
With the publication of the 2016 annual report, Stillfront Group applies the International Financial Reporting Standards framework, IFRS. As of June 16, 2017, Stillfront Group applies to the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. The listing on Nasdaq First North Premier is a seal of quality that enables for additional institutional investors to invest in Stillfront Group and a stepping stone towards the main market at Nasdaq Stockholm.
Nasdaq First North Premier is a list for companies that have committed to comply with a stricter regulatory framework regarding information, accounting and corporate governance. In the annual report for 2016, Stillfront Group has transitioned to IFRS and is now applying IFRS. IFRS is an international accounting framework and a requirement for listing on both Nasdaq First North Premier and the main market at Nasdaq Stockholm. Further, Stillfront Group has chosen to follow the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, which is optional but strongly recommended for Nasdaq First North Premier and required for a listing on the main market at Nasdaq Stockholm.
"Stillfront Group has had a very positive development since its listing on Nasdaq First North. Our determined and long-term work to build a company with balanced risk / return by establishing a portfolio of studios and games has proven to yield results: We enjoy a strong growth with good profitability. The recent issue of a bond loan ensures that we have financial resources for continued growth, both through organic growth and through acquisitions.
Moving to Nasdaq First North Premier, with essentially the same rules and requirements as the main market at Nasdaq Stockholm, is a natural step towards listing on a regulated market. Applying the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and reporting finances according to IFRS, Stillfront Group meets significant parts of the requirements for companies listed on regulated markets," says Jörgen Larsson, CEO of Stillfront Group.
Stillfront Group has been listed at Nasdaq First North since December 2015. The first day of trading on Nasdaq First North Premier will be June 29, 2017.
