Avis Budget Group


Avis Budget Group, Inc. is the American parent company of Avis Car Rental,[2] Budget Car Rental,[2] Budget Truck Rental, Payless Car Rental, Apex Car Rentals,[3] Maggiore Group[4] and Zipcar.[5] The company's headquarters are located in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States.
As of 2011,[needs update] Avis Budget is the leading general-use vehicle rental company in North America, Australia and New Zealand.[6]
History[edit]
Following the decision to dissolve the Cendant company name and split into four separate companies, the vehicle rental division of Cendant became Avis Budget Group in 2006.[7] At the end of 2008, Avis Budget became the first vehicle rental company to begin deployment RFID transponders in their fleet using a product from TransCore which includes an active RFID tag that can work with nearly all electronic toll collections systems in the United States, including E-ZPass in the Northeast, TxTag (Texas) and SunPass (Florida).[8]
On September 5, 2012, Avis Budget Group acquired Apex Car Rentals of New Zealand. [3][9]
On 14 March 2013 Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar for about US$500 million in cash. Zipcar now operates as a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed, and passed the reins to a new company President, Mark Norman.[10]
On April 9, 2015, Avis Budget Group announced it had completed the acquisition of Maggiore Group, Italy's fourth-largest vehicle rental company.[4][11]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Avis Budget Group: Why Its Demise Is In Sight - Avis Budget Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CAR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Avis Budget Group: Why Its Demise Is In SightJun.14.17 | About: Avis Budget (CAR) Adem Tumerkan Contrarian, gold & precious metals, macro, Anti-fragilityThe Lone Wolf InvestorSummaryThe economy is suffering from anemic growth. In a time of a tightening Fed, it is only worsening and harshly affecting the auto sector.New auto loan originations are collapsing, and delinquencies are trending up. All while used car prices have begun to decline, catching many off guard, and will only worsen from now.Car rental companies, such as Avis Budget Group and Hertz, command massive fleets of used cars which they depend on for resale income and collateral for debt.Avis is overwhelmed by creditors and other claimants. Dangerously so. And have razor-thin net margins to try and service these loans, of which $1.5 billion comes due before January 2019.Avis generated no free cash flow for years and depends on yield-starved creditors to maintain its business, which is capital-intensive and sensitive to a weak economy, making it fragile. Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ:CAR) is one of the largest car rental companies in the world. I am sure any of you have seen it at airports or used its service if your car broke down. I know when I was younger my dad's Cadillac CTS broke down, and we went to Avis and left in a Chrysler 300. But now that I am in my mid-20s, I have a new appreciation for looking at things. And, after looking more closely at Avis, I am almost certain the company is dangerously close to insolvency if the economy further weakens. A softer economy, declining car prices, years of negative free cash flow, and an over-leveraged balance sheet is a fatal combination for car renters. Avis depends on managing a massive fleet of used cars, and their increasing prices have been great for its total assets and collateral base. During the last few years, we have witnessed a booming auto bubble and rising vehicle prices. This greatly benefited Avis and its stock price. But I believe the tide is turning. In fact, it already has past the turning point. The stock's been pummeled thus far in 2017. But I think it is only the beginning of its descent downwards. I now present my short case against Avis Budget Group. I. Avis's asset base is a massive fleet of rental cars. Thus, the bulk of its revenues come from selling used cars. So, how does Avis depend on rising car prices? Avis and other car rentals buy cars outright from manufacturers, or get them on a buyback program. The buyback program cars are called 'Program Cars' and cost more since car companies assume the risk of buying them back later. Outright purchases are called 'Risk Cars' because Avis is responsible for what it will be able to sell them for at a later date. This way it can assume what they will be worth on the market, inflating its future asset expectations. Avis's fleet is made up 44% 'Program Cars', and the rest are 'Risk Cars'. Avis is trying to attract buyers of cars through its website that offer $500 discounts. I expect these discounts to greatly increase as new and used car prices fall. Morgan Stanley recently published a report on the weakening used car market. And, I share these expectations. 

 Its conclusion is grave. Even if the bull market continues on through 2021, the best case for used car prices will be to remain flat. A stagnant market, or the base scenario, will have losses around -20%. And, a bear market, or recession, prices would plummet over -50%. It appears that after years of used car price strength, the cycle is now turning. 

 NADA Used Car Guide index collapse is concerning to all. Especially how used car prices have a direct effect on new car prices. Deutsche Bank noted the recent surprise of the -7.7% year-over-year drop during February 2017.    Rental-car company bonds are turning into lemons. Debt issued by Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HTZ) and Avis Budget Group Inc., which had traded at or above par in recent years, tumbled to new lows earlier this month amid signs that used-vehicle prices are dropping twice as much as expected. That's bad news for companies that collectively have to dispose of about 400,000 vehicles a year, and especially for Hertz, whose junk-rated debt is teetering close to a downgrade - wrote Molly Smith on Bloomberg  I expect that Avis's bonds won't be far behind Hertz's junk rating. This severe drop in used car prices will lead to huge writedowns of Avis's capital assets. It also means less money the company will make when it sells the cars from its fleet. It had a paltry 1-3% net margin during the good years, which is extremely slim. If Avis had weak margins and a mounting pile of debt during the 'car bubble' years and post-2008 recovery, imagine how bad things will get during a slowdown. During the years of rising car prices, Avis was able to hold on to its fleet vehicles longer, giving them better margins for resale. But now falling car prices mean the opposite. 

 During the chaos of 2008, Avis's stock fell all the way to .40 cents. This is important because such low margin, capital intensive, and highly leveraged businesses are very sensitive to financial market and economic changes. II. Taking a closer look at Avis's capital structure, how would a softer economy and declining used car prices affect its business now? 

 Observing how Avis's debt to equity has deteriorated is cringeworthy. Not that it was in particularly any good position two years ago. But now it has over $13.5 billion in debt sitting on top of a miniscule sliver of $141 million in equity. That is less than 1%. Other than its debt, Avis's Total Liabilities are truly breathtaking. And, as of June 2017, roughly $19 billion of total liabilities is balancing on top of $141 million in total shareholder equity. In other words, less than 1% of Avis's business is funded by shareholders. And, the other 99%? That comes from creditors and other claimants. And, this is all against a total asset base that is depending on used car prices to perform. Such extreme leverage leaves the company highly vulnerable to even the slightest external, or internal, shock. If the remaining $141 million equity is wiped out, that doesn't necessarily mean the company will cease to operate. While a red flag, negative equity companies can operate (total liabilities overweight total assets). But they need cash flow to meet their liabilities coming due. If the cash flow is inadequate, the company will end up ruined. How is the earning power of Avis? Here are the last 11 quarters. 

 It is as I thought. During the booming car bubble years, it had beaten its Wall Street estimate with strong earnings. But during the last five quarters, Avis has missed its estimates 4/5 times. The latest quarter, May 2017, being a wild miss. And, I expect this trend to continue as car prices sink and the economy contracts. Still, don't be fooled by Avis's EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) and EPS (earnings per share). These are almost meaningless for shareholders because all of what they make from EBITDA goes back into simply maintaining its business and huge rental fleet. What truly matters to investors is free cash flow. This is the means for a company to pay dividends, buy shares back, and grow the company along with shareholder value. 

But Avis makes 0 free cash flow. Therefore, it never has any free cash flow year-over-year growth. And, for long-term EBITDA not to generate any positive free cash flow is troubling. The overwhelmingly leveraged balance sheet explains how its business has been maintained through debt only. Without any generous creditors, Avis would be on life support, if not dead. III. If it wasn't for central bankers, led by the Fed, engaging in ZIRP (zero interest rate policies) and QE (quantitative easing), I don't believe Avis would have been able to get so deep in debt. But as investors and lenders were starved for yield, they make more risky loans. Which gave Avis all the cheap funding it needed to maintain this house of cards. All those investors and creditors that are gobbling up these juicy yields from ABS (auto backed securities) need to simply only remember a decade ago. Recall how the MBS (mortgage backed securities) market got slaughtered when home prices began falling. Auto-backed securities are a huge source of funding in the auto market. Without them, the $1.2 trillion auto loan bubble will lose steam. And, I am afraid it already it has. I expect investors and creditors to have growing concerns about the auto sector, which includes rental car companies. With used car prices falling, Avis's creditors should question the value of its collateral (the fleet of its rental cars). Not only do I see Avis Budget Group's stock and bonds suffering, I believe a complete bankruptcy is more than likely. 

 Avis has significant bonds maturing in the near future, roughly $1.5 billion by January 2019. I am skeptical how it will service these. Its creditors must see Avis's diminishing earnings since 2014, as well as the weakening collateral. I wrote an article a few days ago reviewing the latest collapsing loan growth in the economy. Especially of note is the evaporation of new auto loan growth, all while outstanding current auto loan delinquencies rise. A worst case scenario. I don't see any sudden change for this negative trend in the auto market, let alone the economy as a whole. I expect Avis to only be further strained until it implodes. It wasn't able to make any free cash flow and only polluted its balance sheet with debt during the post-2008 car bubble. Now, in a slowing economy, tightening federal reserve, and declining auto market - this will be too much against it. With its slim margins, liabilities up to its neck, and claimants and creditors howling at its doors, it can surely be squeezed to death. But it's hard to say if it will go bankrupt, even though I fully expect it in the long term. Markets are crazy these days. Give it time. 

Disclosure: I am/we are short CAR, HTZ, F, TSLA. 
I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
Additional disclosure: Rather than SHORTING the following stocks, I found more asymmetry (low risk/high reward) from buying 1 & 2 year PUT OPTIONS that are "out of the money". By buying the PUT options the investors downside is limited in case my thesis is wrong. And if it proves correct, upside is unlimited within the options time frame. 
I have strike prices that are between 50-75% lower than current share prices, as I fully expect the stocks to suffer significantly within that time frame. Also the optionality instead of shorting protects investors from potential rallies or short term swings from Fed jawboning or etc. This allows investors to pay a cheap premium today and wait until the market reprices in the future.

2001年總部位於美國紐約的聖丹特公司（英语：Cendant）以93億7千萬美元的代價收購安飛士集團控股公司（Avis Group Holdings）所有股權，入主安飛士租車公司。翌年巴吉集團自紐約證券交易所下市除牌，並將巴吉租車公司在美國、加拿大、拉丁美洲、加勒比地區、澳大利亞、紐西蘭等分公司的資產全部出售給聖丹特公司；至於其餘全球的分公司則賣給安飛士歐洲公司（Avis Europe, Plc.），自此安飛士·巴吉集團開始成形。
2010年起安飛士·巴吉集團與赫茲租車為了購併道樂·蘇立夫提租車集團（Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc.），出現鷸蚌相爭的局面[5]。不過，2011年9月14日該集團宣布放棄該計畫，使得赫茲租車成為唯一的競購者[6]。2013年1月2日該集團以每股12.25美元、總值4.91億美元收購總部位於麻塞諸塞州的汽車共享公司Zipcar（英语：Zipcar），創立於2000年的後者已發展成為全球最大的汽車共享服務公司，營運範圍包含美國、加拿大、英國、西班牙與奧地利等國家，全球會員總數有76.7萬人[7]。2015年4月9日，該集團宣布以1億6千萬美元的代價併購義大利第四大租車公司馬焦雷集團（Maggiore Group）[8]。
