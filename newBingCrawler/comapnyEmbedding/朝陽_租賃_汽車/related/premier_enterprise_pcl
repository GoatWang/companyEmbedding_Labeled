The world's most secure printing. Based on HP review of 2016 published security features of competitive in-class printers. Only HP offers a combination of security features that can monitor to detect and automatically stop an attack then self-validate software integrity in a reboot. For a list of printers, visit hp.com/go/PrintersThatProtect. For more information: hp.com/go/printersecurityclaims.
More pages per cartridge. More pages versus predecessor cartridges claim based on page-yield comparison of HP 55X High Yield Black Original LaserJet Toner Cartridges with HP 87X High Yield Black Original LaserJet Toner Cartridges. For more information, see hp.com/go/learnaboutsupplies.
 Print speed. Measured using ISO/IEC 24734, excludes first set of test documents. For more information, see http://www.hp.com/go/printerclaims. Exact speed varies depending on the system configuration, software application, driver, and document complexity.
Wireless Direct/NFC. Mobile device needs to be connected directly to the signal of a Wi-Fi Direct® supported MFP or printer prior to printing. Depending on mobile device, an app or driver may also be required. For details, see hp.com/go/mobileprinting. Wi-Fi Direct is a registered trademark of Wi-Fi Alliance®.
Images per minute. Scan speed measured from ADF at default 200 dpi (black-and-white, grayscale, and color). Actual processing speeds may vary depending on scan resolution, network conditions, computer performance, and application software.
Hardware Integration Pocket (HIP). Solutions deployed through the Hardware Integration Pocket (HIP) may require additional purchase.
Web JetAdmin. HP Web Jetadmin is available for download at no additional charge at hp.com/go/webjetadmin.
Optional Trusted Platform Module. Use of the optional HP Trusted Platform Module accessory may require a firmware upgrade.
