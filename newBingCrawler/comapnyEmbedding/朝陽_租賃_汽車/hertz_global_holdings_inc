History[edit]
Early years[edit]
The company was founded by Walter L. Jacobs in 1918, who started a car rental operation in Chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars. In 1923, Jacobs sold it to John D. Hertz who made it a subsidiary of his Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company and renamed it "Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System".
He sold a controlling interest in the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company (and hence also 'Hertz Drive-Ur-Self') to General Motors in 1925 who then purchased the remaining shares in 1943.
Hertz arranged for The Omnibus Corporation, which he also owned, to purchase the car rental business back from GM in 1953. He sold all The Omnibus Corporation's public transport interests the same year, changed its name to 'The Hertz Corporation' and floated it on the New York Stock Exchange the following year.
The Hertz Corporation[edit]
In 1954, the new corporation bought New York truck leasing company, Metropolitan Distributors.[7]
In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA but was operated as a separate entity. In 1985, Hertz joined and was acquired by UAL Corporation. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to 'Park Ridge Corporation', which was then owned by Ford Motor Company and members of Hertz senior management. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation invested in Park Ridge Corporation.[7]
On June 13, 2005, Ford issued a notice that Hertz would be let loose in an initial public offering. On September 8, 2005 it was announced it was to be sold to private equity companies Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, The Carlyle Group, and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity for $15 billion in cash and debt acquisition.[8] The sale was completed on December 22, 2005. This private equity group took Hertz public on November 16, 2006.
On January 11, 2010, Hertz announced the acquisition of used cars dealer British Car Auctions (BCA) for an undisclosed sum.[9]
In November 2011, Hertz introduced ExpressRent kiosks at a number of locations. This was the first large scale car rental kiosk deployment in the U.S. using a live agent assistant via video chat.[10]
On January 3, 2014 it was reported that Hertz shares had jumped in value by 2.6% after the reported purchase of 30-40 million shares by billionaire Carl Icahn in what was believed to be a hostile takeover attempt. In response to Icahn’s reported share purchase the Hertz Board reportedly stated that it would issue one preferred share for each current share in what is referred to as a “poison pill” response.[11]
Key Executives[edit]




Michel Taride in 2015



Kathryn V. Marinello was named President and Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the Board of Directors, of The Hertz Corporation in December 2016.
Tom Kennedy has served as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since December 2013. He is responsible for all aspects of financial management encompassing treasury, tax, risk management, accounting, financial reporting, business planning, corporate development, and corporate policies and procedures.[12]
Tyler Best is the Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer since January 2015. He oversees the company’s global Information Technology (IT) functions.[13]
Alexandria Marren is the Executive Vice President, North American Rental Car Operations since August 2015.[14]
Michel Taride was appointed Executive Vice President and President of Hertz International, Ltd. in January 2010. Taride has managed fleet planning and remarketing functions of Hertz International since December 2010.[15]

Hertz Global Holdings Inc[edit]
In April 2010, Hertz and Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group announced an agreement under which Hertz was to acquire Dollar-Thrifty for a purchase price of US$41 per share, subject to shareholder approval, in a mix of cash and Hertz common stock.[16] Dollar-Thrifty investors in Tulsa, Oklahoma rejected this US$1,440,000,000 bid from Hertz on September 30, 2010.[17] Dollar-Thrifty subsequently announced on October 12, 2011 that it had taken itself off the market because it did not receive any proposals that would pass antitrust review.[18] On August 28, 2012, Hertz announced for the second time its intention to acquire Dollar-Thrifty, subject to FTC approval, in this case for US$2,300,000,000.[19] This merger would yield combined annual sales of US$10,200,000,000.[20] The deal was concluded in November 2012 and resulted in a combined 10,400 locations in approximately 150 countries.
Headquarters relocation[edit]
On May 7, 2013, Hertz executives, alongside Florida Governor Rick Scott, announced the company would be relocating its worldwide headquarters from Park Ridge, New Jersey to Estero, Florida. It will be located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Williams Road and U.S. Highway 41 (South Tamiami Trail), though some operations will still occur in its old headquarters in Park Ridge.
Locations[edit]




Hertz office on the island of Martha's Vineyard


Hertz operates in 145 countries. Outside the US, Hertz has company-operated locations in 18 countries, the rest being franchises. As of December 2012[update], the Company had approximately 3,210 staffed rental locations in the United States and around 1,215 staffed rental locations internationally.[21]
Overland West is the largest Hertz licensee in North America, operating 27 car rental and 4 car sales locations in 8 states.[22] Wilford Gwilliam purchased the Hertz franchise in 1941. He later sold it to Devere J. Sparrow who led the organization until 1976 when he sold it to his son-in-law, Jerry H. Petersen. Jerry grew the business from just a few rental locations and one sales location to what it is today, and still serves as the owner, president and CEO.
Fleet[edit]
The Hertz fleet consists of a wide majority of vehicle manufacturers, with the majority being GM products. Luxury cars are provided by Mercedes, Infiniti, and Cadillac. Previously, due to Hertz's affiliation with Ford, the rental fleet of most locations consisted of Ford and its brands, such as Mazda, Volvo, Mercury and Lincoln, along with various others (mostly Korean and Japanese). As of December 2012[update], the company has over 490,000 cars in the US and a rental fleet in its international operations of over 177,000 cars, exclusive of its licensees' fleet.
Specialty Cars[edit]
In 1966, Hertz engaged racing and automotive designer Carroll Shelby to develop an exclusive version of his modified Ford Mustang. One thousand GT350H Mustangs were built and ultimately sold once their rental use had ended; however, many of them were missing the matching engine. Some customers would rent the car for a weekend and swap out the high-performance engine with a base version 289 cu in (4.7 L) V8. Engine inspections upon return of the rental unit were not common place, so nobody found out until the car was due for service. By that time, there was no way to track down the engine thief. The so-called "rent-a-racer" program in the late-1960s was available in selected locations and the fleet also included Corvettes, Jaguar XK-Es, and AMC AMXs.[23][24]
In 2006, the 40th anniversary of the original GT350H, Hertz introduced the Shelby Mustang GT-H as part of the Fun Collection at select locations. This was followed in 2007 with a convertible version of the GT-H. 2008 saw 500 Chevrolet Corvettes, badged as "ZHZ", available from selected US airports; the following year 350 convertible ZHZs joined the fleet. Both were finished in Hertz' corporate yellow with a central black stripe.
In 2013, Hertz paired with Penske and Ford to manufacture specially-modified black-and-yellow 2013 Ford Mustang GT Premium Coupes that were individually numbered for their fleets at select U.S. airports.
All of Hertz's US specialty cars featured SIRIUS satellite radio, Hertz's NeverLost navigation system, and other features that may not be equipped, or at least may cost extra, on their standard-class vehicles.
Green collection and electric cars[edit]
Hertz launched its "Green Collection" in September 2006 with environmentally friendly vehicles including the Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion, Buick LaCrosse, Toyota Camry, and Hyundai Sonata.[25] All feature Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highway fuel efficiency ratings of 28 mpg‑US (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp) or better on the highway.[26] In early 2007, Hertz launched its global hybrid rental program in conjunction with a $1 million donation to the National Park Foundation.[27]
Hertz has an agreement with Nissan to bring the Nissan Leaf electric car to certain U.S. and European locations. Hertz said it also will supply electrics and plug-in hybrids from other manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, and Mitsubishi.[28]
Hertz 24/7 car sharing[edit]
Hertz 24/7, formerly Hertz on Demand and earlier Connect by Hertz,[29] is the Hertz Corporation’s global car sharing service, launched in December 2008, and currently operates in outside of the United States in select cities in Europe and in Sydney, Australia.[30][31][32] Hertz 24/7 shut down its United States operations, including university campuses, in 2015, and had previously shut operations in select cities in years prior to the full shutdown.[32] On university campuses, Hertz 24/7 offered vehicles in the Personal, Social, and Jet Set Collections.[33]
Following the restructuring, the Hertz 24/7 Service now mainly focuses on hourly van hire at retail outlets in the remaining countries, such as IKEA, Homebase, B&Q, and Costco Wholesale. After a recent fleet replacement scheme, the majority of the vehicles are VW Transporter vans in mainland Europe, and Renault Master LWB Vans in the United Kingdom. Hertz 24/7 Remains available as a fleet management service for the likes of local government offices where a fleet of company cars is necessary, and the Hertz car sharing service makes for easier booking, support and management for these large fleets.
After the United States closure of the Hertz 24/7 service, a similar offering remains available within the United Kingdom, located at universities and colleges around the country. A typical example of the university fleet is at Imperial College, London, where a Nissan Leaf 24KWh, Ford Fiesta 1.0 Auto, and Ford Focus 1.0 Manual are available for use by students, staff, and the general public at both hourly and daily rates.
Customers book online at the Hertz 24/7 Website, or using the Hertz 24/7 Android and iOS app, where they can locate available vehicles and reserve them, subject to a 200% pre-authorization on the user's credit or debit card. 5 Minute prior to the booking start time, the customer is allowed access to the vehicle. The access code will be sent by both E-Mail and SMS, which they can input on a PIN Entry panel located on the driver's side of the vehicle windshield. Alternatively, if the user has been issued with one, they can gain access using their RFID Entry pass. The keys to the vehicle are located on a tether beside the steering wheel, and are only used to operate the engine ignition. Locking the vehicle during a booking session continues to be done via the PIN Entry pad, leaving the keys attached to the tether at all times. a fuel card (or Electric Vehicle Charging Card) is located in the sun visor and the cost of gasoline, electricity or diesel is covered by Hertz. The user simply pays the per-mile charge, regardless of how much fuel was purchased. For example, in the United Kingdom there is no electric vehicle mileage charge, a 25p/mile charge in cars, and 30p/mile charge in vans. All users are required to return the vehicle at the end of the booking on time, clean inside and out, empty and with at least a quarter tank of fuel. Failure to do so will result in penalties for the inconvenience to the next user.
Simply Wheelz and Advantage[edit]
For pre-merger history, see Advantage Rent a Car.
In 2007, Hertz launched subbrand "Simply Wheelz" to address economy-minded and leisure-market customers in Orlando, Florida. The subbrand was colocated within and utilized the fleet and other assets of the parent brand, and channeled reservations and customer-service through a streamlined web front-end (resembling those of low-cost-carrier airlines) to its existing systems. Hertz outbid Enterprise Rent-a-Car acquiring the assets of bankrupt Advantage Rent a Car System in early 2009. The Simply Wheelz subbrand and website were then rebranded as Advantage Rent-a-Car.
On August 26, 2012, Hertz announced that it agreed to sell the US Advantage business to Franchise Services of North America and Macquarie Capital, as a divestiture to receive regulatory approval of Hertz's acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, announced at the same time, and to convert foreign Advantage locations to the Thrifty brand.[34] On December 12, 2012, Advantage Rent A Car was acquired by MacQuarie Capital.
Advertising[edit]
Let Hertz put you in the driver’s seat[edit]
In 1959, the advertising firm of Norman, Craig & Kummel (NCK) was selected as the new advertising agency for Hertz. NCK developed the slogan “Hertz puts you in the driver’s seat,” which was first used commercially in September 1959. NCK quickly changed the wording to “Let Hertz put you in the driver’s seat” by October 1959. Popular a cappella quartet The Hi-Lo's sang the Hertz song for the commercials. Hertz used the line in the early 1960s in print, signs and television. The series is listed as number 65 in the top 100 advertising campaigns of the 20th century by Advertising Age magazine.[35]
John F. Kennedy assassination[edit]

A large billboard advertising Hertz was on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository in Dealey Plaza during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The billboard was removed in 1978.[36]
O.J. Simpson[edit]
O.J. Simpson appeared prominently in ads for the company. The company set the trend of hiring black athletes as sponsors of various brands.[37] In 1975, O.J. Simpson became a staple in American households with his Hertz commercials.[37] One spot from the mid-1970s, showed Simpson, former football star as he was, running through an airport terminal (wearing a three-piece business suit and carrying a briefcase) and leaping over rows of departure lounge seats trying to get to his Hertz rental car. A woman yelled, "Go O.J. Go!" The tagline of the ad, as spoken by O.J., was "Hertz, the superstar in rent-a-car". In later years and through the 1980s, he appeared with golf legend Arnold Palmer; the pair was joined by the early 1990s by actress Jamie Lee Curtis. The relationship between Hertz and Simpson ended in 1994, following Simpson's arrest for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.
Low-floor passenger bus[edit]




A low floor Hertz bus at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago


A significant Hertz-led technology was the development in North America of the low-floor passenger coach. Until the early 21st century, most large Hertz lots were linked to airports they served by small fleets of firm-operated transit buses. Many Hertz locations used the Rapid Transit Series, whose high floor and stairs made loading of baggage difficult and rendered access to wheelchair and ECV-using customers difficult or impossible. A large potential contract from Hertz led Gillig Brothers of Hayward, California, to invest in a radical redesign of the city bus that offered a floor only a foot off of the ground (lower when pneumatically "kneeled") from the front of the bus, between the front wheels, up to the rear axle. The low floor and additional space freed by the redesign, initially titled the "H2000LF" by Hertz, greatly reduced loading and unloading time, increased convenience, and were for a time exclusive to Hertz. The bus was subsequently marketed as the Gillig Low Floor and is widely deployed by U.S. public transportation agencies.
Heavy equipment rental[edit]
Hertz also maintained a heavy equipment rental division known as the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, aka HERC until July 1, 2016. HERC started operating in 1965 with its first location in Houston, TX. It was headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey, United States. In 2014 Hertz announced that they would separate their equipment rental division through a tax free spin off. The split was completed on June 30, 2016 and on July 1, 2016 Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation became an independently publicly traded company called Herc Rentals Inc.[38] HERC has more than 200 branches throughout the United States, Canada, the European Union, and China.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Text of Disclosure:
May 8, 2017 Form 10-Q
Governmental Investigations – In June 2014, the Company was advised by the staff of the New York Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that it is investigating the events disclosed in certain of the Company’s filings with the SEC. In addition, in December 2014 a state securities regulator requested information and starting in June 2016 the Company has had communications with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey regarding the same or similar events. The investigations and communications generally involve the restatements included in the Old Hertz Holdings Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on July 16, 2015 (the “Old Hertz Holdings 2014 10-K”) and related accounting for prior periods.
