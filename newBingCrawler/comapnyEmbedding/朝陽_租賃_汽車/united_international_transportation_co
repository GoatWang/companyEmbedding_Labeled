Budget pledges to extend a helping hand as a Responsible Corporate Citizen to serve the handicapped, orphans, and the underprivileged in KSA through launching initiatives that will reach out to the needy and deserving. One such initiative is the “Give Them A Reason To Smile” campaign, in which Budget Saudi contributes 50% of its sales from the Budget Boutique Collection to charitable organizations for orphaned and handicapped children.Through these numerous efforts, Budget Saudi is able to foster and contribute to the growing Saudi economy and build a regional reputation as one of the largest franchisee of Budget International in the world.
