Europcar and GoMore revolutionize the Medium-Term Rental Market with an Exclusive Car-Sharing Solution, Drive & Share







      QUE DE PRESSE - COMMUNIQUE DE PRESSE - COMMUNIQUE DE PRESSE - COMMUNIQUE DE PRESSE - COMMUNIQUE DE PRES
    

      Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, September 26, 2016
    

      Europcar and GoMore revolutionize the Medium-Term Rental Market with an Exclusive Car-Sharing Solution, Drive & Share
    

      Europcar Lab and GoMore offer the 'ownership' of a new car and the opportunity to share with others, to reduce your costs.
    

      Europcar Lab, the innovation unit of Europcar Group, the European leader in vehicle rental services and a major mobility player, announced today the launch in France of an innovative pilot with GoMore, the European leader in no-fee car sharing. They designed a new everyday car product that combines medium-term rental with the option of car sharing. This innovative urban mobility solution, called Drive & Share1, allows customers to rent a car for 4 to 12 months, with the option of sharing it on the GoMore platform whenever they aren't using it.
    

      A car you can use or share, depending on your needs!
    

      Purchasing and maintaining a new vehicle is expensive, especially when you don't use it that much. According to the website Planetoscope a car is parked on average over 95% of his time. With Drive & Share, customers get all the advantages of a recent Europcar model, which they can use at their convenience or share using the GoMore platform in order to maximize cost-effectiveness.
    

      Drive & Share, available at (http://driveandshare.europcar.fr or https://gomore.fr/leasing) provides an all-in-one at a competitive and attractive monthly flat rate (starting at almost 380 euros2 per month), Drive & Share is an all-in-one solution that includes a vehicle, insurance and maintenance. Customers select their preferred vehicle class and rental package (rental period ranging from 4 to 12 months; third-party, basic or premium insurance). No financial contribution upfront is required: a monthly rental rate is set based on the car and options selected. The car is available in most cases 48 hours after signing up.
    

      Whenever customers don't need their car, they can put it up for sharing on the GoMore platform, thus funding all or part of their rental costs. For example: subleasing a car for about 10 days per month will fully cover the user's monthly rental costs.
    

      "This pilot perfectly reflects Europcar Lab's philosophy, and more broadly, Europcar Group's as a whole, which is to offer innovative, simple and flexible mobility solutions that match consumers' evolving usage patterns, through partnerships with key players in their market, such as GoMore. Today, Drive & Share offers a whole new way to use your car daily based

      on your needs, both in terms of travel and financing! We are the first car rental company to offer the opportunity to reduce your costs by sharing" said Sheila Struyck, Head of Europcar Lab.


      "With the medium-term rental, GoMore continues to innovate on the French Market, as in other European countries. This exclusive service demonstrates our commitment to offer simple solutions, qualitative and accessible to everyone. This exclusive offer, complementary to services already available, meets our members different mobility, sharing and financing needs.
    

      This partnership with Europcar Group reflects our ambition to offer the best services to GoMore's members by surrounding us with the best actors, leader in their markets, who share our innovation commitment." explains Mathieu Boulay, Managing Director of GoMore France.
