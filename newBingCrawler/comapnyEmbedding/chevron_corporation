                    highlights of operations
                
Singapore plays a critical role in Chevron’s global operations.
Singapore is the regional headquarters for our Downstream operations in the Asia-Pacific region, including our manufacturing, marketing and lubricants businesses. We operate under our subsidiary Chevron International Pte. Ltd. Chevron’s supply and trading business has a regional trading hub in Singapore. 
Our lubricant additives manufacturing facility in Singapore, operated by Chevron Oronite Pte. Ltd., is the largest in Asia. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in a Singapore refinery that produces petroleum products for the Asia-Pacific region. Through our joint venture Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC and its affiliates, Chevron also has an interest in Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals (Private) Limited.
The Caltex® brand, which serves customers in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa, is managed from Singapore. There is a network of Caltex service stations and convenience stores in Singapore as well.

                    business portfolio
                
In Singapore, our Chevron International Products business unit manages all of our Downstream fuels businesses and joint ventures outside the Americas. That includes commercial and retail merchandising, marketing, terminal operations, and the promotion and sale of Caltex fuels in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and the Middle East. The organization also directs Chevron’s joint-venture manufacturing in Asia and joint-venture aviation activities in the Middle East.
refining
Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Singapore Refining Company (SRC).

SRC’s refinery processes up to 290,000 barrels of crude oil per day, producing liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, fuel oil and asphalt. In 2016, construction continued on SRC’s gasoline clean fuels facility and cogeneration plant. The new facilities are expected to increase the refinery’s ability to produce higher-value gasoline and improve energy efficiency. The project is expected to be completed in 2017.
supply and trading
Chevron’s Singapore Supply and Trading office is home to one of the company’s four global trading floors, along with London; Houston, Texas; and San Ramon, California. The organization manages daily commodity transactions of 5 million barrels of liquids and 5 billion cubic feet of gas. 
marketing and lubricants
The Caltex® brand – Chevron’s main marketing brand in Asia-Pacific and Africa – is managed from Singapore. 
Chevron offers Caltex products, including Caltex gasoline with Techron® and Caltex Diesel with Techron D®, to consumers in Singapore. Through our Caltex stations and distributors, we also market Delo® and Havoline® lubricants and coolants, along with other lubricating oils and greases, to consumer and business customers. In addition, Havoline® engine lubricants and coolants for passenger cars and motorcycles and Delo® diesel engine oils, greases, other lubricating oils and Techron® Concentrate Plus fuel additives are marketed to consumer, commercial and industrial customers. 
As of early 2017, Chevron has 26 Caltex service stations, 25 Star Mart convenience stores and one mini mart in Singapore. In 2016, Chevron partnered with NTUC Link to join the Plus! loyalty program, which enables motorists to earn and use LinkPoints for eligible fuel transactions at Caltex stations.
Chevron also markets asphalt and fuels to inland industrial and commercial customers. 
Chevron is a major aviation fuel supplier in Singapore. We safely supply the fuel to airlines at Singapore Changi International Airport.

From Singapore, we also market marine fuels and lubricants to customers in Asia.
chemicals
Chevron Oronite
Singapore is the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters for our subsidiary Chevron Oronite Pte. Ltd. Our Singapore manufacturing plant on Jurong Island is the largest additives manufacturing facility in the Asia-Pacific region. Our additives enhance the performance of lubricants in marine, automotive, railroad and natural gas engines as well as in specialty industrial engines and equipment. Additives from our Singapore plant are sold in more than 15 countries throughout the region and are shipped to distribution points worldwide.
The plant has continued to expand since its commissioning in 1999 and has a major project currently underway to add carboxylate production. Carboxylate is a sulfur-free detergent used in high-performance additive packages. A similar unit is already in place in Gonfreville, France, and the addition of the new plant in Singapore will about double Oronite’s global carboxylate capacity upon completion, planned for the fourth quarter of 2017.
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
Chevron is involved in a chemical facility in Singapore through our joint venture Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).
CPChem has a 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals (Private) Limited, a joint venture that operates a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) manufacturing plant on Jurong Island. HDPE is used in pressure piping, gasoline containers and tanks, and soap and detergent bottles, among other things.

Chevron’s global initiative, Fuel Your School, has been modified specifically for Singapore. In 2015, we partnered with the Central Singapore Community Development Council to develop Fuel Your School–STEM @ Central Singapore. The program encourages lower secondary school students to pursue their interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. For two years, participants have engaged in carefully curated learning projects and hands-on activities that help bridge textbook knowledge with real-world applications. At one workshop, approximately 240 junior engineers were inspired by the anti-gravity hover vehicles often featured in science fiction movies to design and ultimately fly their own prototypes. Students used advanced concepts such as magnetism, sensor technology, electronics, mechanical engineering and vector forces to build and fly their creations. Those with the most impressive vehicles – as chosen by a panel of judges and the community via social media – received cash prizes for their respective schools, helping fund the schools’ mathematics and science departments.
From 2012 through 2014, Chevron Singapore partnered with the People’s Association in Caltex PAssion for Kids, an enrichment program targeted at underserved families. This initiative inspired learning in underprivileged children in primary and secondary schools by giving them the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop new skills in different ways. 
Chevron Singapore received the Community Spirit Award from the People’s Association in recognition of our contributions to the community in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

                    record of achievement
                
In 1933, Chevron entered the Singapore market through The Texas Company (China) Ltd., a former Texaco company. In 1936, a partnership between Chevron and Texaco created the Caltex® brand. In 1937, Caltex introduced its first fuel oil and diesel fuel bunkering terminals. Operations started at the Tanjong Pagar Terminal in 1938. Caltex significantly expanded operations in 1958 with the addition of another bunkering terminal. In 1964, a lubricants blending plant was built in Tanjong Penjuru.
Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001.
introducing lubricant additives
In 1972, Chevron Oronite opened a sales office in Singapore for Oronite® additives. In 1995, Singapore became the Asia-Pacific regional hub for Oronite.
In 1999, we built our Singapore manufacturing plant, the largest lubricant additives manufacturing plant in Asia.
a leader in refining
In 1979, Chevron, through Caltex, became a one-third partner in Singapore Refining Company.
The partners upgraded the refinery in the 1980s by adding visbreaker, reformer and hydrocracking units, which greatly increased the refinery’s capacity and enabled it to meet changing demands in the market.
In 1995, the refinery was further upgraded at a cost of $1 billion. A residual fluid cracking unit and other associated facilities were installed, which increased production of gasoline and diesel.
Singapore became the regional headquarters for Chevron’s Asia-Pacific Downstream operations in 2001. 
The refinery’s crude oil processing capacity continued to grow steadily. In 2004, Chevron’s interest in SRC increased to 50 percent. 
From 2013 to 2016, Singapore was headquarters for the company’s Asia-Pacific exploration and production operations. 
operational excellence
As a business partner and as a member of the community, Chevron is committed to creating superior value for our investors, customers and partners, the Singapore government, local communities, and our workforce.
Operational excellence – which we define as the “systematic management of process safety, personal safety and health, environment, reliability, and efficiency to achieve world-class performance” – is a critical driver for business success and a key part of our enterprise execution strategy.
honored in the business community
We and our affiliates have made significant contributions to Singapore as investors and employers for more than 80 years.
Our commitment to Singapore was recognized by the Economic Development Board in 2005, when Chevron received the Distinguished Partner in Progress Award for our commitment to developing Singapore’s manufacturing industry and for our contributions to the people and economy of Singapore.
In 2009 and 2010, Chevron Singapore was recognized for our human resources (HR) initiatives. The Singapore Human Resources Institute honored Chevron with the following awards:

Leading HR Practices Award in Strategic HR
Talent Management 
Retention and Succession Planning
Employment Relations and People Management
Health and Employee Wellness
Workplace Safety and Health
Learning and Human Capital Development

In 2010, Chevron won the Grass Roots Asia Pacific Award for Best Reward and Recognition Strategies at the HRM Awards Singapore.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
This Site contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron’s operations that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy related industries. Words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “believes,” “seeks,” “schedules,” “estimates,” “positions,” “pursues,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “budgets,” “outlook,” “focus,” “on schedule,” “on track,” “goals,” “objectives,” “strategies” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date issued. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; the company's ability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of the company's suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats and terrorist acts, crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or other natural or human causes beyond its control; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic and political conditions; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; the company’s future acquisition or disposition of assets or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions set forth in the applicable transaction agreements; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company's ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 22 of the company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.
Certain terms, such as "unrisked resources," "unrisked resource base," "recoverable resources," “potentially recoverable volumes” and "original oil in place," among others, may be used to describe certain aspects of the company's portfolio and oil and gas properties beyond the proved reserves. For definitions of, and further information regarding, these and other terms, see the "Glossary of Energy and Financial Terms" on pages 50 and 51 of the company's 2016 Supplement to the Annual Report. As used in this report, the term "project" may describe new upstream development activity, including phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investment in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term "project" as it relates to any specific government law or regulation.

Page ContentProduct Summaries
As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the continued safe handling and use of our products, a multi-disciplinary team at Chevron Phillips Chemical reviews our product portfolio for product stewardship purposes. This evergreen process includes a review of the associated hazard communication documents, transportation options, customer feedback, regulatory and technical data.
Our product portfolio review is prioritized based on a weighted composite score of environmental fate, end use, physical and human hazards, regulatory profile, distribution exposure, production volume, public perception aspects and marketing aspects.
In order to facilitate a more transparent process and to enhance communication within the product stewardship chain, our Product Stewardship Summaries for all of our products will be made public for all interested parties on this site as they become available.
If a Product Summary is not listed for your product below, check back periodically for updates. For questions or comments regarding Product Summaries or any other regulatory compliance questions, please use our Regulatory and Compliance Inquiries form. 
Thank you for your continued product stewardship partnership,
William S. Utley, Ph.D., DABTManager, Product Safety & Toxicology

Texaco, Inc. ("The Texas Company") is an American oil subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. Its flagship product is its fuel "Texaco with Techron". It also owns the Havoline motor oil brand. Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron Corporation in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to the Shell Oil Company. It began as the Texas Fuel Company, founded in 1901 in Beaumont, Texas, by Joseph S. Cullinan, Thomas J. Donoghue, Walter Benona Sharp, and Arnold Schlaet upon the discovery of oil at Spindletop.
For many years, Texaco was the only company selling gasoline under the same brand name in all 50 US states, as well as Canada, making it the most truly national brand among its competitors. It was also one of the Seven Sisters which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Its current logo features a white star in a red circle (a reference to the lone star of Texas), leading to the long-running advertising jingles "You can trust your car to the man who wears the star" and "Star of the American Road."[citation needed] The company was headquartered in Harrison, New York, near White Plains, prior to the merger with Chevron.
Texaco gasoline comes with Techron, an additive developed by Chevron, as of 2005, replacing the previous CleanSystem3. The Texaco brand is strong in the U.S., Latin America and West Africa. It has a presence in Europe as well; for example, it is a well-known retail brand in the UK, with around 1,100 Texaco-branded service stations.[citation needed]

Texaco was founded in Beaumont, Texas as the Texas Fuel Company in 1901. In 1905, it established an operation in Antwerp, Belgium, under the name Continental Petroleum Company, which it acquired control of in 1913.[2] The next year, Texaco moved to new offices in Houston on the corner of San Jacinto and Rusk. In 1928, Texaco became the first U.S. oil company to sell its gasoline nationwide under one single brand name in all 48 states (50 states after Alaska and Hawaii joined the Union in 1959).
In 1931, Texaco purchased Indian Oil Company, based in Illinois. This expanded Texaco's refining and marketing base in the Midwest and also gave Texaco the rights to Indian's Havoline motor oil, which became a Texaco product. The next year, Texaco introduced Fire Chief gasoline nationwide, a so-called "super-octane" motor fuel touted as meeting or exceeding government standards for gasoline for fire engines and other emergency vehicles.[3] It was promoted through a radio program over NBC hosted by Ed Wynn, called the Texaco Fire Chief.
In 1936, the Texas Corporation purchased the Barco oil concession in Colombia, and formed a joint venture with Socony-Vacuum, now Mobil, to develop it. Over the next three years the company engaged in a highly challenging project to drill wells and build a pipeline to the coast across mountains and then through uncharted swamps and jungles.[4] During this time, Texaco also illegally supplied the fascist Gen. Franco faction in Spanish Civil War, despite a federal fine, with a total 3,500,000 barrels (560,000 m3) of oil.[5]
Also in 1936, marketing operations east of Suez (including Asia, East Africa, and Australasia) were placed into a joint venture with Standard Oil Company of California – Socal (Chevron) under the brand name Caltex, in exchange for Socal placing its Bahrain refinery and Arabian oilfields into the venture. The next year, Texaco commissioned industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague to develop a modern service station design.
In 1938, Texaco introduced Sky Chief gasoline, a premium fuel developed from the ground up as a high-octane gasoline rather than just an ethylized regular product. In 1939, Texaco became one of the first oil companies to introduce a "Registered Rest Room" program to ensure that restroom facilities at all Texaco stations nationwide maintained a standard level of cleanliness to the motoring public.

After the onset of World War II in 1939, Texaco's rogue CEO, Torkild Rieber, an admirer of Hitler, hired pro-Nazi assistants who cabled Berlin “coded information about ships leaving New York for Britain and what their cargoes were.” This espionage easily enabled Hitler to destroy the ships.[6] In 1940, Rieber was forced to resign when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the Herald Tribune through information produced by British Security Coordination.[7][8][9] During the war, Texaco ranked 93rd among United States corporations in the value of military production contracts.[10] In 1947, Caltex expanded to include Texaco's European marketing operations. That same year, Texaco merged its British operation with Trinidad Leaseholds under the name Regent; it gained full control of Regent in 1956,[11] but the Regent brand remained in use until 1968-9. In 1954, the company added the detergent additive Petrox to its "Sky Chief" gasoline, which was also souped up with higher octane to meet the antiknock needs of new cars with high-compression engines. The next year, Texaco became the sole sponsor of The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC-TV. In 1959, the Texas Company changed its corporate name to Texaco, Inc. to better reflect the value of the Texaco brand name, which represented the biggest selling gasoline brand in the U.S. and only marketer selling gasoline under one brand name in all 50 states. It also acquired McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Ltd. of Canada and changes its name to Texaco Canada Limited.[12] Around this time, Paragon Oil, a major fuel oil distribution company in the northeastern U.S, was acquired.

In 1964, Texaco introduced the "Matawan" service station design at a station in Matawan, New Jersey.[13] Two years later, Texaco replaced the long-running banjo sign with a new hexagon logo that had previously been test-marketed with the "Matawan" station design introduced two years earlier. The new logo featured a red outline with TEXACO in black bold lettering and a small banjo logo with a red star and green T at bottom. The following year, the Regent name was replaced by Texaco at British petrol stations.[14] In 1970, in response to increasingly stringent federal emission standards that would ultimately lead to the mandating of unleaded gasoline in 1975 and later-model cars and trucks, Texaco introduced lead-free Texaco as the first regular-octane lead-free gasoline at stations in the Los Angeles area and throughout Southern California. Lead-free Texaco became available nationwide in 1974. On November 20, 1980, the Lake Peigneur/Jefferson Island disaster occurred. Two years later, a new service station design was introduced. Several product names were also changed with the advent of self-service including Lead-free Texaco to Texaco Unleaded, Fire Chief to Texaco Regular, and Super Lead-free Sky Chief to Texaco Super Unleaded.
In 1982, Texaco Canada Limited merged with Texaco Explorations Canada Limited to form Texaco Canada Incorporated,[12] with head offices in Toronto.

On November 19, 1985, Pennzoil won a US$10.53 billion verdict against Texaco in the largest civil verdict in US history. This was due to the fact that Texaco established a signed contract to buy Getty Oil after Pennzoil entered into an unsigned, yet still binding, buyout contract with Gordon Getty. In 1987, Texaco filed for bankruptcy. It was the largest in U.S. history until 2001.[15]
In January 1989, Texaco and Saudi Aramco agreed to form a joint venture known as Star Enterprise in which Saudi Aramco would own a 50% share of Texaco's refining and marketing operations in the eastern U.S. and Gulf Coast.[16] In 1989, Texaco introduced System3 gasolines in all three grades of fuel, featuring the latest detergent additive technology to improve performance by reducing deposits that clog fuel injection systems. Toronto-based Texaco Canada Incorporated was sold to Imperial Oil with all Texaco Canada retail operations converted to Esso brand. Two years later, the company was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[17] In 1991, non retail Canadian operations became Texaco Canada Petroleum Incorporated with head office in Calgary, Alberta. In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, as a result of massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco's Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents.[18]
In 1994, Texaco's System3 gasolines were replaced by new CleanSystem3 gasoline for improved engine performance. In 1995, Texaco merged its Danish and Norwegian downstream operations with those of Norsk Hydro under the new brand HydroTexaco. This joint venture was sold in 2007 to Norwegian retail interests as YX Energi, following the purchase of Hydro by Statoil. In 1996, Texaco paid over $170 million to settle racial discrimination lawsuits filed by black employees at the company. It was the largest racial discrimination lawsuit settlement in the U.S. at the time, and was particularly damaging to Texaco's public relations when tapes were released containing ethnic slurs used repeatedly by company officers at high-level corporate meetings.

In 1999, the company formed the joint venture Equilon with Shell Oil Company, combining their Western and Midwestern U.S. refining and marketing.[19] This gave rise to the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court antitrust case of Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, which cleared both Texaco and Shell of any antitrust liability concerning the pricing of Equilon's gasoline. That same year, another joint venture, Motiva, was formed with Shell Oil Company and Saudi Aramco in which the Star Enterprise operations were merged with the Eastern and Gulf Coast U.S. refining and marketing operations of Shell.[19] On February 8, 2002 Chevron Corporation merged with Texaco and Shell purchased Texaco's interest in the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures.[20] Shell began converting its Texaco stations to the Shell brand the next year.[21] In July 2004, Chevron regained non-exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S.[22] The following year, in August, Texaco introduced the Techron additive into its fuels in the U.S. and parts of Latin America.[23] In 2007, Delek Benelux took over marketing activities for Chevron in Benelux, including 869 filling stations, mostly under the Texaco brand.[24] Chevron Corporation also sold its Conoco stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand name. Texaco Canada Petroleum Incorporated was dissolved in 2008 with Texaco exiting from the Canadian market. In 2010 Texaco ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic US, removing their brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C.[25]
Corporate headquarters[edit]
Prior to the merger, Texaco's headquarters, a 750,000-square-foot (70,000 m2) building, were in Harrison, New York, near White Plains.[26][27][28] In 2002, Chevron sold the former Texaco headquarters to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley bought the building and the surrounding 107 acres (0.43 km2) for $42 million.[26]
Texaco leased 14 floors of the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City in the 1930s. As part of the leasing agreement with Texaco the building opened the Cloud Club, a restaurant area for executives. Texaco moved to Westchester County, New York, in 1977. This contributed to the closure of the Cloud Club in 1979.[29]
In popular culture[edit]

Texaco is associated with the Havoline brand of motor oil and other automotive products. It was one of the sponsors of NASCAR with many drivers, such as Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett; Kenny Irwin, Jr.; Ricky Rudd, Jamie McMurray, Casey Mears, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Texaco recently sponsored the #42 Dodge driven by Montoya. Havoline continuously sponsored a car from the early 1980s to 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Texaco / Havoline officially ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and Chip Ganassi Racing. This brought to a close a 20+-year relationship with the sport.
Texaco has also been involved in open wheel racing, sponsoring the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston along with sponsoring drivers like Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti and his son Michael.
In Formula One, Texaco sponsored the Team Lotus in 1972 and 1973, and McLaren from 1974 to 1978. The company returned to Grand Prix racing at a smaller scale in 1997, with their brands appearing on the Stewart SF01 car. Their association with the team and its successor, Jaguar Racing, continued until the end of 2001.
Texaco sponsored the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Rover Vitesse factory team at the 1985 and 1986 European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) under their Bastos brand, and the Ford Sierra RS500 factory cars entered by Eggenberger Motorsport in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship (plus the 1988 ETCC and other European-based championships). Texaco also sponsored cars in the 1987 World Rally Championship.
From 1987-1993, Texaco was the major sponsor (through their Australian Caltex offshoot) Colin Bond Racing in Australian touring car racing, first with the Alfa Romeo 75 turbo in 1987, then the Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988-1992 and then Toyota's in 1993. From 2000 until 2007, it was title sponsor of Stone Brothers Racing with Russell Ingall winning the 2005 championship. In 2016, Caltex became title sponsor of the Triple Eight Race Engineering car of Craig Lowndes, having previously been an associate sponsor of the team.
Texaco was long associated with the Metropolitan Opera as sole sponsor of its radio broadcasts for 63 years. It was identified as well with such entertainment legends as Bob Hope, Jack Benny and Milton Berle (many of their shows were originally sponsored by Texaco – see Texaco Star Theatre, which includes the sponsorship lyrics of the opening theme: "We're the men of Texaco, We work from Maine to Mexico..."). Berle's program was broadcast in the same time slot as Fulton J. Sheen's religious program for a while, thus leading to Berle's oft-quoted quip, "We both have the same boss – Sky Chief!"
From 1984 to 1998, Texaco were the title sponsors of the main One Day International cricket tournament in England, the Texaco Trophy. It also sponsored the Texaco Cup, a football tournament for clubs of the British Isles.
Environmental issues[edit]
Main article: Lago Agrio oil field
From 1965–1993, Texaco participated in a consortium to develop the Lago Agrio oil field in Ecuador. It has been accused of extensive environmental damage from these operations, and faces legal claims from both private plaintiffs and the government of Ecuador. The case has been widely publicized by environmental activists and is the subject of Crude, a 2009 documentary film by Joe Berlinger. Chevron claims that it is being unfairly targeted as a deep pocket defendant, when the actual responsibility lies with the government and its national oil company, Petroecuador.[citation needed]
The NiMH chemistry used in modern hybrid vehicles was invented by ECD Ovonics founder, Stan Ovshinksy, and Dr. Masahiko Oshitani of the Yuasa Company[30][31] In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics's battery development and manufacturing. On October 10, 2001, Texaco purchased GM's share in GM Ovonics, and Chevron completed its acquisition of Texaco six days later. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics.[32] Chevron's influence over Cobasys extends beyond a strict 50/50 joint venture. Chevron holds a 19.99% interest in ECD Ovonics.[33] In addition, Chevron maintains the right to seize all of Cobasys' intellectual property rights in the event that ECD Ovonics does not fulfill its contractual obligations.[34] On September 10, 2007, Chevron filed a legal claim that ECD Ovonics has not fulfilled its obligations. ECD Ovonics disputes this claim.[35] Since that time, the arbitration hearing was repeatedly suspended while the parties negotiate with an unknown prospective buyer. No agreement has been reached with the potential buyer.[36] Cobasys's patents relating to NiMH batteries expired in 2015.
In Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell or license them to small companies or individuals.[37] Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for these batteries. When Boschert conducted her research, major auto makers showed little interest in large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs. Because no other companies were willing to make large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format NiMH battery technology for automotive purposes. Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles."[38]
In an interview with the Economist, Ovshinsky subscribed to the former view. "I think we at ECD we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company, frankly speaking. And I think it’s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business, rather than building the business.[39]"
In December 2006, Cobasys and General Motors announced that they had signed a contract under which Cobasys provides NiMH batteries for the Saturn Aura hybrid sedan.[40] In March 2007, GM announced that it would use Cobasys NiMH batteries in the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu hybrid as well.
In October 2007, International Acquisitions Services, Inc. and Innovative Transportation Systems AG filed suit against Cobasys and its parents for refusing to fill a large, previously agreed-upon order for large-format NiMH batteries to be used in the electric Innovan.[36]
In August 2008, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International Inc. filed suit against Cobasys claiming that Cobasys isn’t delivering the batteries it agreed to build for Mercedes-Benz’s planned hybrid SUV.[41]
Cobasys was sold[42] in 2009 to SB Li Motive, which is a joint venture formed by Bosch and Samsung to develop lithium ion batteries for automotive applications. The sale price was not disclosed. The German-Korean company will integrate Cobasys as the North American branch of the company. Cobasys will supply batteries to the new Mercedes ML450 hybrid.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation. One of the successor companies of Standard Oil, it is headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries. Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy industries, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation. Chevron is one of the world's largest oil companies; as of 2014[update], it ranked third in the Fortune 500 list of the top US closely held and public corporations and sixteenth on the Fortune Global 500 list of the top 500 corporations worldwide.[5][6] It was also one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.
Chevron's downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company's most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average 3.1 million barrels per day (490×103 m3/d) of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
Chevron's alternative energy operations include geothermal, solar, wind power, biofuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen. In 2011–2013, the company planned to spend at least $2 billion on research and acquisition of renewable power ventures. Chevron has claimed to be the world's largest producer of geothermal energy. In October 2011, Chevron launched a 29-MW thermal solar-to-steam facility in the Coalinga Field to produce the steam for enhanced oil recovery. The project is the largest of its kind in the world.
Chevron is also one of the first two fuel brands to be Top Tier certified. The other is Tulsa, Oklahoma based QuikTrip.

History[edit]
Predecessors[edit]




Chart of the major energy companies dubbed "Big Oil" sorted by latest published revenue


One of Chevron's early predecessors, Star Oil, discovered oil at the Pico Canyon Oilfield in the Santa Susana Mountains north of Los Angeles in 1876. The 25 barrels of oil per day well marked the discovery of the Newhall Field, and is considered by geophysicist Marius Vassiliou as the beginning of the modern oil industry in California.[7] Energy analyst Antonia Juhasz has said that while Star Oil's founders were influential in establishing an oil industry in California, Union Mattole Company discovered oil in the state eleven years prior.[8]
In September 1879, Charles N. Felton, Lloyd Tevis, George Loomis and others created the Pacific Coast Oil Company, which acquired the assets of Star Oil[7] with $1 million in funding.[9] Pacific Coast Oil became the largest oil interest in California,[9] by time it was acquired by Standard Oil for $761,000 in 1900.[7] Pacific Coast operated independently and retained its name until 1906, when it was merged with a Standard Oil subsidiary and it became Standard Oil Company (California) or California Standard.[10][11]
Another predecessor, Texas Fuel Company, was founded in 1901 in Beaumont, Texas as an oil equipment vendor by "Buckskin Joe". The founder's nickname came from being harsh and aggressive.[8] Texas Fuel worked closely with Chevron. In 1936 it formed a joint venture with California Standard named Caltex, to drill and produce oil in Saudi Arabia.[12] According to energy analyst and activist shareholder Antonia Juhasz,[13][14][15] the Texas Fuel Company and California Standard were often referred to as the "terrible twins" for their cutthroat business practices.[16] The Texas Fuel Company was renamed the Texas Company, and later renamed Texaco.[11][16]
Formation of the Chevron name[edit]




A Chevron station branded under the Standard name in Las Vegas


In 1911, the federal government broke Standard Oil into several pieces under the Sherman Antitrust Act. One of those pieces, Standard Oil Co. (California), went on to become Chevron. It became part of the "Seven Sisters", which dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century. In 1926, the company changed its name to Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL).[17] By the terms of the breakup of Standard Oil, at first Standard of California could use the Standard name only within its original geographic area of the Pacific coast states, plus Nevada and Arizona; outside that area, it had to use another name. Today Chevron is the owner of the Standard Oil trademark in 16 states in the western and southeastern U.S. To maintain ownership of the mark, the company owns and operates one Standard-branded Chevron station in each state of the area.[18] Although its status in Kentucky is up in the air after Chevron withdrew retail sales from Kentucky in July 2010.[19]
The Chevron name came into use for some of its retail products in the 1930s. The name Calso was also used from 1946 to 1955 in states outside its native West Coast territory.[20][21]
Standard Oil Company of California ranked 75th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[22]
In 1933, Saudi Arabia granted California Standard a concession to find oil, which led to the discovery of oil in 1938. In 1948, California Standard discovered the world's largest oil field in Saudi Arabia, Ghawar Field.[23] California Standard's subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, grew over the years and became the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1944. In 1973, the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO. By 1980, the company was entirely owned by the Saudis, and in 1988, its name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company—Saudi Aramco.[citation needed]
Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984, which was the largest merger in history at that time. To comply with U.S. antitrust law, California Standard divested many of Gulf's operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States. (The refinery is currently owned by Sunoco.) Among the assets sold off were Gulf's retail outlets in Gulf's home market of Pittsburgh, where Chevron lacks a retail presence but does retain a regional headquarters there as of 2013, partially for Marcellus Shale-related drilling.[24] The same year, Standard Oil of California also took the opportunity to change its legal name to Chevron Corporation, since it had already been using the well-known "Chevron" retail brand name for decades. Chevron would sell the Gulf Oil trademarks for the entire U.S. to Cumberland Farms, the parent company of Gulf Oil LP, in 2010 after Cumberland Farms had a license to the Gulf trademark in the Northeastern United States since 1986.[25]
In 1996 Chevron transferred its natural gas gathering, operating and marketing operation to NGC Corporation (later Dynegy) in exchange for a roughly 25% equity stake in NGC.[26] In a merger completed February 1, 2000, Illinova Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. and Chevron's stake increased up to 28%.[27] However, in May 2007 Chevron sold its stake in the company for approximately $985 million, resulting in a gain of $680 million.[28][29]
Merger with Texaco and post-merger[edit]
On October 15, 2000, Chevron announced acquisition of Texaco in a deal valued at $45 billion, creating the second-largest oil company in the United States and the world's fourth-largest publicly traded oil company with a combined market value of approximately $95 billion.[30][31][32][33] The merged company was named ChevronTexaco. On May 9, 2005, ChevronTexaco announced it would drop the Texaco moniker and return to the Chevron name. Texaco remained as a brand under the Chevron Corporation.[34]
On October 10, 2001, Texaco purchased General Motors' share in GM Ovonics, which in 2003, was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices Ovonics. In 2009, both Chevron and Energy Conservation Devices sold their stakes in Cobasys to SB LiMotive Co.[citation needed]

In 2005, Chevron purchased Unocal Corporation for $18.4 billion, increasing the company's petroleum and natural gas reserves by about 15%.[35][36][37][38] Because of Unocal's large South East Asian geothermal operations, Chevron became a large producer of geothermal energy.[39]
Chevron and the Los Alamos National Laboratory started a cooperation in 2006 to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil shale by developing a shale oil extraction process named Chevron CRUSH.[40] In 2006, the United States Department of the Interior issued a research, development and demonstration lease for Chevron's demonstration oil shale project on public lands in Colorado's Piceance Basin.[41] In February 2012, Chevron notified the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Reclamation, Mining and Safety that it intends to divest this lease.[42]
In July 2010, Chevron ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic United States, removing the Chevron and Texaco names from 1,100 stations.[43] In 2011, Chevron acquired Pennsylvania based Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion in cash and an additional $1.1 billion in existing debt owed by Atlas.[44][45][46] Three months later, Chevron acquired drilling and development rights for another 228,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale from Chief Oil & Gas LLC and Tug Hill, Inc.[47]
In September 2013, Total S.A and its joint venture partner agreed to buy Chevron’s retail distribution business in Pakistan for an undisclosed amount.[48] In October 2014, Chevron announced that it would sell a 30 percent holding in its Canadian oil shale holdings to Kuwait’s state-owned oil company Kuwait Oil Company for a fee of $1.5 billion.[49]
Operations[edit]
Chevron employs approximately 62,000 people (of whom approximately 31,000 are employed in U.S. operations). In October 2015, Chevron announced that it is cutting up to 7,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce.[50]
Upstream[edit]
Chevron's oil and gas exploration and production operations are primarily in the US, Australia, Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan, and the Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2010, the company had 10.545 billion barrels (1.6765 billion cubic metres) of oil-equivalent net proved reserves. Daily production in 2010 was 2.763 million barrels per day (439.3 thousand cubic metres per day).
In the United States, the company operates approximately 11,000 oil and natural gas wells in hundreds of fields occupying 4,000,000 acres (16,000 km2) across the Permian Basin, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. In 2010, Chevron was the fourth largest producer in the region.[51] In February 2011, Chevron celebrated the production of its 5 billionth barrel of Permian Basin oil.[52] The Gulf of Mexico is where the company's deepest offshore drilling takes place at Tahiti and Blind Faith. It also explores and drills the Marcellus Shale formation under several northeastern US states.
Chevron's largest single resource project is the $43 billion Gorgon Gas Project in Australia. It also produces natural gas from Western Australia. The $43 billion project was started in 2010 and was expected to be brought online in 2014.[53] The project includes construction of a 15 million tonne per annum liquefied natural gas plant on Barrow Island, and a domestic gas plant with the capacity to provide 300 terajoules per day to supply gas to Western Australia.[54] It is also developing the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas development in Western Australia. The foundation phase of the project is estimated to cost $29 billion; it will consist of two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of 8.9 million tons per annum, a domestic gas plant and associated offshore infrastructure.[55] In August 2014 a significant gas-condensate discovery at the Lasseter-1 exploration well in WA-274-P in Western Australia, in which Chevron has a 50% interest was announced.[56]
In the onshore and near-offshore regions of the Niger Delta, Chevron operates under a joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, operating and holding a 40% interest in 13 concessions in the region. In addition, Chevron operates the Escravos Gas Plant and the Escravos gas-to-liquids plant.[57]
Chevron has interests in four concessions in Angola, including offshore two concessions in Cabinda province, the Tombua–Landana development and the Mafumeira Norte project, operated by the company. It is also a leading partner in Angola LNG plant.[58][59]
In Kazakhstan, Chevron participate the Tengiz and Karachaganak projects.[60] In 2010, Chevron became the largest private shareholder in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline, which transports oil from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.[61]
As of 2013, the Rosebank oil and gas field west of Shetland was being evaluated by Chevron and its partners. Chevron drilled its discovery well there in 2004. Production is expected in 2015 if a decision is made to produce from the field. The geology and weather conditions are challenging.[62]
Downstream[edit]
Chevron's downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company's most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average 3.1 million barrels per day (490×10^3 m3/d) of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.[63] The company operates approximately 19,550 retail sites in 84 countries. The company also has interests in 13 power generating assets in the United States and Asia and has gas stations in Western Canada.[citation needed] Chevron owns the trademark rights to Texaco and Caltex fuel and lubricant products.[citation needed]
In 2010, Chevron processed 1.9 million barrels per day (300×10^3 m3/d) of crude oil.[63] It owns and operates five active refineries in the United States, one in Cape Town, South Africa, and one in Burnaby, British Columbia. Chevron is the non-operating partner in seven joint venture refineries, located in Australia,[64] Pakistan,[65] Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, and New Zealand.[66] Chevron's United States refineries are located in Gulf and Western states. Chevron also owns an asphalt refinery in Perth Amboy, New Jersey; however, since early 2008 that refinery has primarily operated as a terminal.[67]
Chevron's chemicals business includes 50% ownership in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, which manufactures petrochemicals, and the Chevron Oronite Company, which develops, manufactures and sells fuel and lubricant additives.[citation needed]
Chevron Chemical produced paraquat.[68]
Chevron Shipping Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, provides the maritime transport operations, marine consulting services and marine risk management services for Chevron Corporation.[citation needed] Chevron ships historically had names beginning with "Chevron", such as Chevron Washington and Chevron South America, or were named after former or serving directors of the company. Samuel Ginn, William E. Crain, Kenneth Derr, Richard Matzke and most notably Condoleezza Rice were among those honored, but the ship named after Rice was subsequently renamed as Altair Voyager.[69]
Alternative energy[edit]




Chevron's 500kW Solarmine photovoltaic solar project in Fellows, California


The Chevron's alternative energy operations include geothermal, solar, wind, biofuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen.[70]
Chevron has claimed to be the world's largest producer of geothermal energy.[39] The company's geothermal operations are primarily located in Southeast Asia.[71][72][73]
Chevron operates geothermal wells in Indonesia providing power to Jakarta and the surrounding area. In the Philippines, Chevron also operates geothermal wells at Tiwi field in Albay province, the Makiling-Banahaw field in Laguna and Quezon provinces.[74]
In 2007, Chevron and the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) started collaboration to develop and produce algae fuel, which could be converted into transportation fuels, such as jet fuel.[75] In 2008, Chevron and Weyerhaeuser created Catchlight Energy LLC, which researches the conversion of cellulose-based biomass into biofuels.[76] In 2013, the Catchlight plan was downsized due to competition with fossil fuel projects for funds.[77]
Between 2006 and 2011, Chevron contributed up to $12 million to a strategic research alliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop cellulosic biofuels and to create a process to convert biomass like wood or switchgrass into fuels. Additionally, Chevron holds a 22% stake in Galveston Bay Biodiesel LP, which produces up to 110 million US gallons (420,000 m3) of renewable biodiesel fuel a year.[78][79]
In 2010, the Chevron announced a 740 kW photovoltaic demonstration project in Bakersfield, California, called Project Brightfield, for exploring possibilities to use solar power for powering Chevron's facilities. It consists of technologies from seven companies, which Chevron is evaluating for large-scale use.[80][81] In Fellows, California, Chevron has invested in the 500 kW Solarmine photovoltaic solar project, which supplies daytime power to the Midway-Sunset Oil Field.[82] In Questa, Chevron has built a 1 MW concentrated photovoltaic plant that comprises 173 solar arrays, which use Fresnel lenses.[83][84] In October 2011, Chevron launched a 29-MW thermal solar-to-steam facility in the Coalinga Field to produce the steam for enhanced oil recovery. As of 2012, the project is the largest of its kind in the world.[85]
In 2014, Chevron began reducing its investment in renewable energy technologies, reducing headcount and selling alternative energy-related assets.[86]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Finance[edit]
For the fiscal year 2011, Chevron reported earnings of US$26.9 billion, with an annual revenue of US$257.3 billion, an increase of 23.3% over the previous fiscal cycle. Chevron's shares traded at over $105 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$240 billion.[87]
Headquarters[edit]




Chevron tower in Houston


Chevron's corporate headquarters are located in a 92-acre campus in San Ramon, California. The company moved there from its earlier headquarters at 555 Market Street in San Francisco, California, where it was located since its inception in 1879.[88] Chevron also operates from office towers in Houston, Texas, where it leased the 1500 Louisiana Street and 1400 Smith Street from former Texas energy giant Enron. Chevron is also planning a new office tower in downtown Houston next to its existing properties at 1600 Louisiana Street.[89] The building will stand 50-stories and 832 feet. Upon completion, it'll be the fourth tallest building in Houston and the first 50-story building constructed there in nearly 30 years.
Political contributions[edit]
Since January 2011 Chevron has contributed almost $15 million on Washington lobbying. On October 7, 2012 Chevron donated $2.5 million to the Republican Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC that is closely tied to former House Speaker John Boehner.[90]

Niger Delta Partnership Initiative[edit]
In 2010 Chevron established the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative (NDPI), a non-profit that works with local organizations to promote economic growth, reduce HIV transmission rates, and empower women. The Initiative was initially funded with a $50 million grant. An additional $40 million was donated in 2013.[91][92]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental damage in Ecuador[edit]
Main article: Lago Agrio oil field




Oil pollution in Lago Agrio, November 2007


Texaco and Gulf Oil began operating in the Oriente region of Ecuador in 1964 as a consortium.[93] Texaco operated the Lago Agrio oil field from 1972 to 1993 and the Ecuador state oil company continued to operate the same oil fields after Texaco left. In 1993, Texaco was found responsible for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste and they spent $40m cleaning up the area during the 1990s. In 1998, the Ecuadorean government signed an agreement with Texaco accepting the clean-up as complete and absolving Texaco of any further responsibility. That same year, an Ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after Texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half. The clean up was called "a sham" by critics.[who?][94]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Chevron was filed in Ecuadorian court for $28 billion by indigenous residents, who accused Texaco of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging 18 billion US gallons (68,000,000 m3) of formation water into the Amazon rainforest without any environmental remediation.[95][96][97][98][99] Chevron said that the company had completed cleanup of the pollution caused by Texaco, that current pollution was the result of activities of the Ecuadorian oil interests, and that the 1998 agreements with the Ecuadorian Government exempted the company from any liabilities.[100][101][101][102][103]
In 2011, Ecuadorian residents were awarded $8.6 billion, based on claims of loss of crops and farm animals as well as increased local cancer rates.[94][104][105] The plaintiffs said this would not be enough to make up for the damage caused by the oil company.[106] The award was later revised to $19 billion on appeals, which was then appealed again to the Ecuadorean National Court of Justice.[107] The action has been called the first time that indigenous people have successfully sued a multinational corporation in the country where the pollution took place.[94][104][106]
Chevron described the lawsuit as an "extortion scheme" and refused to pay the fine.[94]
In November 2013, the international arbitration tribunal issued a partial award in favour of Chevron and its subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company. The tribunal has found Chevron is not liable for environmental claims in Ecuador.[108]
In March 2014, a United States district court judge ruled that the Ecuadorian plaintiff’s lead attorney, Steven Donziger, had used “corrupt means,” including "coercion, bribery, money laundering and other misconduct," to obtain the 2011 court verdict in Ecuador. The judge did not rule on the underlying issue of environmental damages. While the US ruling does not affect the decision of the court in Ecuador, it has blocked efforts to collect damages from Chevron in US courts. Donziger has appealed.[100][100][109][110]
In April 2015, AmazonWatch released videos reportedly sent from a whistleblower inside Chevron. The videos purportedly show employees and consultants finding petroleum contamination at sites in the Ecuadorean Amazon that the company claimed was cleaned up years earlier. These videos were confirmed as legitimate by Chevron legal counsel.[111] According to the company, the videos show routine testing to establish the perimeter of oil pits. The company further stated that it is not possible to determine from the videos whether the sites shown are the responsibility of Chevron or its former partner, Petroecuador. According to Amazon Watch, the videos contain a map confirming that the sites are Chevron's, and contain footage of interviews with villagers known to live in the area for which Chevron is responsible.[112]
Chevron continues to take oil from the Amazon region at large. El Segundo (CA), Pascagoula (MS), and Richmond (CA) refineries all process Amazonian oil. In 2015 El Segundo was the single largest refiner in the U.S. of Amazon Crude, processing 54,463 barrels per day.[113]
Oil spills in Angola[edit]
In 2006, Chevron's operations in Africa were criticized as environmentally unsound by 130 Nigerian researchers, journalists, and activists.[114] In 2002 Angola demanded $2 million in compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by Chevron, the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters.[115]
U.S. Clean Air Act Settlements[edit]
On October 16, 2003, Chevron U.S.A. settled a charge under the Clean Air Act, which reduced harmful air emissions by about 10,000 tons a year.[116] In San Francisco, Chevron was filed by a consent decree to spend almost $275 million to install and utilize innovative technology to reduce nitrogen and sulfur dioxide emissions at its refineries.[117] In 2000, Chevron paid a $6 million penalty as well as $1 million for environmental improvement projects to settle charges of Clean Air Act violations related to offline loading terminal operations in El Segundo, California.[118] Chevron also had implemented programs that minimized production of hazardous gases, upgraded leak detection and repair procedure, reduced emissions from sulfur recovery plants, and adopted strategies to ensure the proper handling of harmful benzene wastes at refineries.[116] Chevron also spent about $500,000 to install leakless valves and double-sealed pumps at its El Segundo refinery, which could prevent significant emissions of air contaminants.[118]
In 2011, Chevron was recognized by the environmental group Ceres for its efforts to reduce global warming by cutting its own emissions and investing in renewable energy technologies.[119]

Cobasys LLC was a supplier of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, battery control systems, and packaged solutions for automotive applications, uninterruptable power supplies, telecommunications applications, and distributed power generation.[120] For 8 years ending in 2009, Cobasys was a 50-50 joint venture between California-based Chevron Corporation and Michigan-based Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (also called ECD Ovonics, ECD, or Ovonics)[121][122] The intermediary hierarchy of ownership was that Cobasys LLC was owned by Chevron's subsidiary Chevron Technology Ventures LLC, and ECD Ovonics' subsidiary Ovonic Battery Company.[123] Cobasys spent $180 million in funding from Chevron Technology Ventures, and the two owners were unable to agree on further funding of the company. After arbitration between the owners had stalled, a buyer was found. On July 14, 2009, the sale of Cobasys to SB LiMotive Co. Ltd., an electric vehicle battery joint venture between Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. and Robert Bosch GmbH, was announced.
Sherry Boschert accused Chevron of limiting access to large NiMH batteries through its stake in Cobasys corporation and control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Cobasys filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Panasonic and Toyota over production of the EV-95 battery used in the RAV4 EV.[124][125] The case was settled with each company granting the other a license to its patents.[126] In her book, Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals. Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries. Major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs. Because no other companies were willing to place large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format NiMH battery technology for automobiles. Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles."[127] In an interview with The Economist, the ECD Ovonics founder Stan Ovshinsky disagreed, stating "Cobasys isn't preventing anything. Cobasys just needs an infusion of cash. They build a great battery"."[128]
In October 2007, International Acquisitions Services and Innovative Transportation Systems filed suit against Cobasys and its parents for failure to fill an order for large-format NiMH batteries to be used in the electric Innovan.[129] In August 2008, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International filed suit against Cobasys, on the ground Cobasys did not tender the batteries it agreed to build for Mercedes-Benz's planned hybrid SUV.[130] The Mercedes suit was settled for $1.3 million dollars.[131]
Niger Delta shootings[edit]
On May 28, 1998, activists staged a demonstration and took several individuals hostage on a company oil platform in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Nigerian police and soldiers were allegedly flown in with Chevron helicopters.[132] Soldiers shot at the activists and subsequently two activists (Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu) died from their wounds.[132] In 2007 U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, allowed a lawsuit brought by victims and victims' families against Chevron to proceed, saying that there may be evidence that Chevron had hired, supervised, and/or provided transportation to Nigerian military forces known for their "general history of committing abuses."[133] In December 2008, a federal jury cleared Chevron of all charges brought against them in the case. Chevron had stated that the military intervention was necessary to protect the lives of its workers and considers the jury's decision vindication for the accusations of wrongdoing.[134]
UN sanctions[edit]
According to US Embassy Cable BAGHDAD 000791 the Iraqi prime minister believed that Chevron was engaged in negotiations to invest in Iran in contravention of UN sanctions. The embassy related that it had no independent confirmation of this claim.[135] This document was intended to have been kept secret until 2029.[136]
Richmond, California refinery[edit]
The Richmond refinery paid $540,000 in 1998 for illegally bypassing waste water treatments and failing to notify the public about toxic releases.[137] Overall, Chevron is listed as potentially liable for 95 Superfund sites, with funds set aside by the EPA for clean-up.[138][unreliable source?]
A 1989 explosion and fire at the refinery[139] resulted in a $877,000 OSHA fine for "willfully failing to provide protective equipment for employees." Chevron employees had "repeatedly requested" protective equipment since the early 1980s but the company had refused despite more than 70 fires in the plant since 1984. Elizabeth Dole, the US Secretary of Labor, said: "OSHA's investigation makes clear that Chevron knew of the need for protective equipment and clothing."[140]
On March 25, 1999, an explosion and fire at the refinery that spread noxious fumes and sent hundreds of Richmond residents to hospitals.[141]
On August 6, 2012, a large fire erupted at the refinery.[142][143] Initial reports estimated that 11,000 people sought treatment at area hospitals,[144] and later reports placed the number above 15,000 people.[145] The company pleaded no contest to six charges in connection with the fire, and agreed to pay $2 million in fines and restitution.[146] Around the same time the settlement was announced, the Richmond city council voted to file suit against Chevron. The reasons for the suit included "a continuation of years of neglect, lax oversight and corporate indifference to necessary safety inspection and repairs."[145]
Oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro[edit]
Further information: Energy in Brazil
On November 8, 2011, Chevron came under fire by Brazilian authorities for its role in the spill of crude oil off of the southeastern coast of Brazil.[147] The Brazilian regulators said 416,400 liters of oil leaked over the course of two weeks from undersea rock near the well in the Frade oil project 370 km off the Brazilian coast.[148] Prosecutors in Brazil initially demanded $10.6bn in the subsequent lawsuit. The National Petroleum Agency (ANP) suspended Chevron's activities in Brazil until it identified the cause of an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.[149]
The National Petroleum Agency later concluded that the spill did not cause significant economic damage, injured no one, and never approached Brazil's coast. Criminal charges were dropped and the lawsuits were settled for a total of $130 million.[150][151]
KS Endeavor explosion[edit]
The KS Endeavor jackup rig exploded on January 16, 2012, while drilling an exploration well for Chevron in the Funiwa field in Nigeria. The explosion resulted in the death of two of the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on June 18. According to a Reuters news report, workers on the KS Endeavor were ignored by Chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole. A senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build-up of pressure. A witness said that rig engineers advised Chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but Chevron told them to continue with drilling. Expecting an explosion, the rig manager, one of the two that later died, kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use. A witness reported: "This is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen, but just didn't know when." In an email response to Reuters, Chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe.[152][153]
Forest Fire in Lawachara National Park, Bangladesh[edit]
On June 26, 2008, a forest fire broke out in Lawachara National Park, Bangladesh, while Chevron was carrying out a 3D seismic survey. Chevron stated that it was not conducting activities in the area in which the fire broke out.[154][155]
Polish gas exploration[edit]
Chevron has experienced protests aimed at the company by local communities in Southern Poland when they started gas exploration in the region. Their complaint is that Chevron didn't provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in Poland, and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders. The landholders of the region view Chevron's presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region. As well, potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers. Another of the residents' primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking. In response to some of the protests, Chevron has sued some of the protesters from Żurawlów for disrupting their operations.[156]
According to gas and oil expert Andrzej Szczesniak, one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between Polish and American law. In the USA property owners typically receive 15-20% from the income of gas exploration. In Poland, the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property, with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue. This is the result of outdated, Communist Era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if they can get a 'kick back' from a larger company.[157][158]
Argentina agreement and protests[edit]
After the 2012 decision of the Argentine government to regain control of the biggest oil company of the country, YPF, the search for foreign investors for exploitation of unconventional oil started. Finally in 2013, YPF and Chevron signed an agreement for the Vaca Muerta oil field, the world’s second-largest shale gas deposit. In August 2013, the Congress of Neuquén province approved the agreement, while between 5,000[159][160] and 10,000[161] workers, students and indigenous people protested outside the legislature. Police fired rubber bullets, hitting some protesters.[159] Governor Jorge Sapag defended the police actions: “The march was generally peaceful, but about 100 people separated from the rest and attacked the police. The police acted with seriousness and professionalism.”[162]
Public Eye Lifetime Award[edit]
In 2015, Chevron received the Lifetime Award of the Public Eye on Davos for what the sponsors called Chevron's responsibility for environmental disaster in the Amazon.[163] The same group cited the company in 2006 in the category "Environment" for oil soiling in the Amazonas in Ecuador.[164] A Chevron spokesperson commented that the award was "nothing more than a stunt to distract attention from the fact that the lawsuit against Chevron in Ecuador has been proven to be meritless and the product of unprecedented fraud" and pointed to a U.S. court finding that the plaintiff's lawyers had committed "mail and wire fraud, money laundering, witness tampering and obstruction of justice." [165] That controversial RICO case is under appeal and has been criticized by environmental and human rights groups.[166]
Global warming[edit]
In a letter Chevron Corp. argued that under current disclosure rules companies are already required to disclose material risks including climate-change risk, during part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s consultation process, noting that its “2015 Form 10-K included a significant discussion of the potential risks of additional greenhouse gas emissions regulation following the outcome of the Paris Accord.”[167]

It was one year ago when a massive fire at a Chevron refinery in Richmond, California, sent toxic smoke billowing into the air about 10 miles northeast of San Francisco. In the aftermath, more than 15,000 people sought medical treatment for respiratory problems. On Monday, Chevron pleaded no contest to six criminal charges related to the fire and agreed to submit to additional oversight over the next few years and pay $2 million in fines and restitution as part of a plea deal with state and county prosecutors. Two days earlier, thousands of people marched to condemn safety issues at Chevron’s plant and to call for renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.

                            scams
                        




contact us
Individuals claiming to represent Chevron or one of its many subsidiaries have approached people in a variety of fraudulent business transactions.
While Chevron has contacted law enforcement agencies regarding these kinds of activities, it is often difficult to locate and prosecute the perpetrators. Anyone receiving one of these offers should report the matter to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by these individuals, and we hope the following explanations will be helpful. Please note that the information below is a sampling of the various frauds being attempted; new versions of fraud are frequently reported.
Chevron and Texaco promotion scam
Individuals will claim to manage or run a promotion offered by Chevron or a subsidiary and ask potential participants to fill out a simple entry form. Alternatively, individuals will claim to offer proceeds in exchange for an “insurance payment.” They will claim that the promotion was sponsored by Chevron or a subsidiary.
If an insurance payment is requested, victims are usually requested to send the insurance payment via personal check or a money order. This particular kind of activity is called Advance Fee Fraud or 419 Fraud. Neither Chevron Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries offer proceeds in exchange for insurance payments. Whether or not a payment is requested to enter the promotion, Chevron is not associated with the individuals offering these insurance payments or with the individuals who claim to manage or run the promotion. These are not valid offers.
Chevron online endowment fund award scam
Victims will be approached by individuals claiming to represent the Chevron Online Endowment Award Fund (COEFA) as a potential beneficiary of a cash prize. Potential “winners” may be asked to fill out an entry form.
In order to receive their “prize,” victims may be requested to send an insurance payment via personal check or a money order. This particular kind of activity is called Advance Fee Fraud or 419 Fraud. Neither Chevron Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries offer donations or grants in exchange for insurance payments. Whether or not a payment is requested, Chevron is not associated with the individuals offering these insurance payments or with the individuals who claim to manage or run the program. These are not valid offers.
Deceased employee inquiry scam
Victims will be approached by individuals claiming to represent the estate of a deceased Chevron employee. These individuals will claim the employee died without any heirs and, for a fee, will offer to transfer the inheritance to the victim.
Fictitious job offer scam
Individuals will claim they are under contract with Chevron or a subsidiary to locate prospective employees for work on projects.
These offers usually are sent via email and will typically advise the victims they either have been hired by the company or may obtain employment with the company, and for a fee (the amount varies from $100 to as much as several thousand dollars), the individual will process the victim’s employment papers, tender offers, job applications and work permits. Victims are usually requested to send their fees, via a personal check or a money order, to a post office box either in the United States or another country. In some instances, victims are promised or receive checks to cover relocation expenses. Such promises and/or checks are not made or generated by Chevron or in any way associated with Chevron.
This particular kind of activity is called Advance Fee Fraud or 419 Fraud. Chevron does not seek fees for securing positions with the company from either prospective employees or contractors. These are not legitimate Chevron job offers.
If you should receive such an offer, we ask that you report the matter to the U.S. Secret Service.
Grant and donation scam
Victims will be approached by individuals claiming to represent Chevron or Chevron/Texaco Exploration and Production as the recipient of a cash grant or donation. They will ask potential “winners” to fill out an entry form.
If an insurance payment is requested, victims are usually requested to send the insurance payment via personal check or a money order. This particular kind of activity is called Advance Fee Fraud or 419 Fraud. Neither Chevron Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries offer donations or grants in exchange for insurance payments. Whether or not a payment is requested to enter the program, Chevron is not associated with the individuals offering these insurance payments or with the individuals who claim to manage or run the donation/grant program. These are not valid offers.
Lottery winner scam
Individuals will claim to manage or run a lottery offered by Chevron or a subsidiary and ask potential participants to fill out a simple entry form. Alternatively, individuals will claim to offer lottery proceeds in exchange for an “insurance payment.” They will claim that the lottery was sponsored by Chevron or a subsidiary.
If an insurance payment is requested, victims are usually requested to send the insurance payment via personal check or a money order. This particular kind of activity is called Advance Fee Fraud or 419 Fraud. Neither Chevron Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries offer lottery proceeds in exchange for insurance payments. Whether or not a payment is requested to enter the lottery, Chevron is not associated with the individuals offering these insurance payments or with the individuals who claim to manage or run the lottery. These are not valid offer.
Procurement scam
Vendors will be approached by individuals claiming to represent Chevron or a subsidiary. These individuals usually work by email and will advise the victim that they are being invited to bid for a large equipment or supply order. They are then asked to pay a qualification fee.
This particular kind of fraudulent activity is called “Advance Fee Fraud” or 419 Fraud. Chevron does not seek fees for doing business with the company. These are not valid offers. If you should receive such an offer, we ask that you report the matter to the U.S. Secret Service or to your local law enforcement agency.
