The Mission Marketing Group plc (AIM:TMMG): Financial Strength Analysis



Lawrence Carr 


            				April 15, 2017			        


 Small-cap companies such as The Mission Marketing Group plc (AIM:TMMG) with its market cap of USD $41 Million, benefit the most from improving economic conditions due to the growth potential, but on the other hand they also are highly prone to a downturn, thus making their financial strength an important factor in filtering out the risky ones. Although TMMG’s low debt-to-equity ratio of 16.4% indicates financial strength, there’s more to it than just one ratio. 
 One of the major reasons that they are highly affected by a downturn in the country’s economy or an industry in the region is the lack of geographic diversification. So, investors often choose small-cap funds. On the other hand, well-versed investors allocate a small part of their portfolio capital to individual small-caps, primarily to improve its risk-return profile. However, that doesn’t reduce the risks these companies face individually. But I believe that it can be reduced to some extent by looking at these back of the hand balance sheet calculations. See our latest analysis for TMMG 
Does Mission Marketing Group’s liquidity position also indicate financial strength?
 Despite low debt, for Mission Marketing Group to continue operations during a downturn, it needs a sound liquidity position. When evaluating financial strength, I compare a company’s current assets (cash and liquid assets) to its total debt. TMMG’s current assets of £34 Million cover the company’s total debt of $13 Million, indicating that the company is in a sound position to pay-down its debt when needed or favourable.
 

 Mission Marketing Group (AIM:TMMG) Historical Debt Apr 15th 17
 
Does TMMG earn more than its interest payments?
 A different way of looking at financial health is to compare Mission Marketing Group’s earnings and interest-obligations. While both these numbers are taken from the income statement, they are important in assessing whether Mission Marketing Group can easily service its debt during adverse conditions.Any company earning more than five times its interest costs is in quite a healthy financial position. In TMMG’s case the interest on debt is well covered by earnings (8.1x coverage).
 

 Mission Marketing Group (AIM:TMMG) Net Worth Apr 15th 17


Conclusion
 Not only does Mission Marketing Group has a well-managed debt profile, its interest costs are well covered by its net income and operating cash flows are strong enough to contribute in its growth activities or pay dividends. In short, it’s creating value for shareholders. Now when you know whether you should keep the debt in mind as a risk factor when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you check out our latest free analysis report on Mission Marketing Group to see what are TMMG’s growth prospects and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

PlanningThe planning stage is the most important stage in the project. It defines how goals will be met, what actions are neccesary and how and when they will be taken.
                                                    
                                                    And when we are done with the planning stage we'll move forward and link every action to the overall mission and vision. 
ExecutionExecution is what we take pride in and what ultimately builds our reputation. We look forward to meeting you and meeting the challenges in front of you. We believe there's a great solution out there for every project and we know that working together we can and will find it.  






What Clientâ€™s Say





"Long Drivers of America contracted Mission Marketing Group to help facilitate the finals of the RE/MAX World Long Drive Championship.   Its owner, John Erickson balanced both the live show and live to tape television show seamlessly.  Mission Marketing delivered exactly what we signed up for, complete organization, detailed planning and solid execution."









Art SellingerCEO, Owner - Long Drivers of America






"When I was with United Way of New York City, I partnered with John and MMG to produce our annual fundraising videos highlighting the impact of United Way's work in high poverty areas of the city. With each video, John demonstrated exceptional story-telling skills in conveying the often complex stories of creating change in people's lives. He was able to clearly convey the ideas and approaches in a way that captured both the hearts and minds of donors across the five boroughs of New York City. On a practical level, I really appreciated John's ability to take a list of interviewees, handle all of the communications and scheduling, and produce a first-rate video on time, every time.  He relates extremely well to all types â€“ from busy corporate CEO's to individuals and families coping with hunger and homelessness.  I cannot recommend John and MMG highly enough."









Kathy WallingVP, Communications 1996 to 2013 - United Way of New York City






"In my experience with John, I have found that he listens to your concerns, wants and needs and is then able to crystallize what the best line of attack would be for the project.   MMG's video production takes the same approach, combining strategy and planning with a great 'eye' to make sure it translates to a great product for the customer."









Kim HawkinsVice President, RE/MAX Alliance






"Over the years I have had the good fortune to work with MMG on numerous productions. A great interviewer and storyteller, John is able to get people to easily express themselves during the production process. Watching John direct and collaborating with him has also been rewarding as partners to help us creatively capture the still photographs my clients need. John is a consummate pro and a great guy on top of it."









Ben AsenBen Asen Photography






"I have had the great pleasure of working with MMG over many years on a number of highly successful projects in the Real Estate Industry. John and MMG have the unique ability to interface fluidly with strategic planning and production teams to create the most attractive and cost effective projects I have ever been associated with. On top of that, they are a pleasure to work with - trustworthy, detail-motivated and time-frame-sensitive. I highly recommend utilising the services MMG provides."









Dave Garland Principal - Pacific States Capita






Truly one of the most unique facets John has is the ability to take a complex concept to communicate, and simplify it into a message that is meaningful to an audience. MMG executes across the gamut from hand holding a first time video client to executing the the most complex visions an Ad agency might have. As a Director of Photography, I appreciate a partner who has a clear and concise vision of the project they are working on and that's where MMG shines.  Their collaborative spirit and approach shows up in the final project time and time again. The last thing I will say is that in my 30 years of production I can honestly say John is the best interviewer I have ever worked with. I have never met a person that can relate, engage, and listen better. Whether talking with the governor of the state, the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a destitute mother, John can converse on any level in a polished, knowledgeable and endearing matter of factness that allows his subjects to feel totally at ease. 






Richard GolishCamera, Lighting Director - Rich Golish Productions






I have worked with John Erickson at Mission Marketing Group for over 15 years on everything from large corporate projects to smaller individual projects and his attention to detail has always been second to none! He treats each project with equal importance and always strives for customer satisfaction and high value content development. In my business I have seen many ill-fated projects take place due to lack of proper project management and creativity, but John has always managed his projects with skill and precision! I would highly recommend using Mission Marketing Group for your next project!






Bob SwansonSwanpro Studios






"I have had the pleasure to work with John Erickson and MMG for many years.

John's creativity and professionalism is evident in his work and he consistently exceeds my expectations in quality and results. 
Great vision and the talent to deliver that vision. 
 
He is a team player who is committed to the process and dedicated to the results.

I highly recommend MMG and John."
