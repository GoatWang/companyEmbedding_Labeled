The company was incorporated in 2006 and launched in 2007 as AdsMarket.[2] Clients include HSBC, American Express and AT&T.[3] The company was founded by current Matomy CEO Ofer Druker, Adi Orzel and Kfir Moyal,[4] and is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, with additional offices in Madrid, Mexico City, Berlin, Munich, London, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Fla,[5] New York City and San Francisco.

Acquisitions and Investments[edit]
Much of the company's growth has come through strategic acquisitions.[5] The first acquisition was Matomy Money, an alternative payment solutions provider, in 2010.[8] The following year, the company purchased a minority stake in Denver-based interactive marketing company Adperio. Adperio was founded in 1994 and offers social media, email, SEO, mobile and other emerging technology solutions.[9] In 2013, the company made several additional acquisitions, beginning in January when it purchased New York-based MediaWhiz, enhancing its US presence. MediaWhiz was a leading US-based performance marketing agency that provided clients with permission-based email marketing, affiliate marketing and data acquisition; clients included AT&T, Home Depot and Bally Total Fitness.[10] Also in 2013, the company acquired the social marketing agency portion of Adquant (formerly Adotomi)[11] in a move designed to increase the depth of its social media marketing solution, for an undisclosed figure. Adquant/Adotomi is a Facebook Preferred Marketing Developer. The company acquired Florida-based mobile ad network MobAff in July 2013, enhancing its offering in the rapidly growing mobile marketing industry.[12]
In 2014, Matomy announced the acquisition of a majority ownership stake in Team Internet AG, a Munich-based direct navigation search company, in addition to the acquisition of the Austrian-based mobile programmatic advertising firm MobFox.[13] Matomy became a publicly traded company on the High Growth Segment of the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market in July 2014, and is listed under the stock ticker symbol MTMY.[14] Following its initial public offering, Matomy received an $82 million investment from global advertising holding company Publicis Groupe, which acquired 24.9% of Matomy’s ordinary shares.[15] On 15 April 2015, Matomy announced it had bought 70% of newly formed Canadian-based Avenlo who have developed a platform for direct email marketing campaigns. The acquisition has been valued at around $17.6million.[16]
Leadership[edit]
Ofer Druker is CEO of Matomy Media Group and was a co-founder of the company. Druker had founded or co-founded several successful media sites prior to joining Matomy Media as the company's CEO in 2008.[17]
Sagi Niri is the COO and CFO of Matomy Media Group and served in the same capacity at predecessor company, Adsmarket Ltd. He previously served as Financial Department Manager and Chief Controller with McCann Erickson Group[18] from 1998 to 2006.

Competitive Advantages






                    Fast-growing market
                    


Matomy operates within the fastest-growing advertising market: digital. By 2016, global digital advertising spend is projected to reach $171 billion, according to eMarketer. Additionally, Matomy’s identified strategic growth activities of mobile, social and video advertising are three of the fastest-growing digital ad mediums, with projected 2012–16 CAGRs of 54%, 30% and 24%, respectively.





                    Multi-channel integrated platform
                    


Matomy offers advertisers a centralised and integrated digital advertising solution — the Matomy Performance Platform — and one point of contact for campaign management. Matomy is one of the few digital performance-based marketing companies able to deliver campaigns across eight media channels.





                    Scalable and adaptable technology platform
                    


The Matomy Performance Platform is a leading proprietary performance-based advertising technology platform. The platform is highly scalable and adaptable, as well as cost efficient, enabling Matomy to offer customised performance-based advertising solutions to its customers.





                    Commercial diversification drives stability
                    


Matomy has a highly diversified business model that drives its stability. No single customer contributes more than 8% of total revenues, no customer vertical contributes more than 14% of total revenues and no single digital media source contributes more than 5% of total media cost. Matomy offers advertisers one of the largest and most diversified network of digital media sources.





                    Mobile everywhere
                    


Matomy’s acquisition in November 2014 of MobFox, one of Europe’s leading mobile programmatic ad platforms, set a new course for the Group’s mobile activities. Matomy expects that within five years more than 50% of its revenues will be derived from mobile activity. Mobile is a growth driver in all of Matomy's growing activities, including: email, search, social and domain monetisation.
