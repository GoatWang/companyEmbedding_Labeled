Company Overview

002830-CN has traded publicly for less than a year.


It currently trades at a Price/Book ratio of (6.34).


The market expects 002830-CN to grow faster than its peers and for the company to improve its current ROE.


002830-CN‘s relative asset efficiency and net profit margins are both around the median level.


Changes in  annual revenues are in line with its chosen peers but lags in terms of earnings suggesting that the company is less cost conscious and may be spending for growth.


002830-CN‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years is around the peer median and suggest that it does not have any particular operational advantages versus peers.


The company’s margins are around the peer medians and do not suggest any benefit from a pricing or an operating cost advantage versus peers.


While 002830-CN‘s revenues have increased slower than peer median, the market currently gives the company a higher than peer median P/E ratio and may be factoring in some sort of a strategic play.


The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.
