transcosmos and IBM Japan collaborate in the field of online marketing

April 25, 2011
transcosmos inc.
            IBM Japan, Ltd.




transcosmos inc. (Headquarters: Shibuya Ward, Tokyo; President and COO: Masataka Okuda; hereafter, transcosmos) and IBM Japan, Ltd. (Headquarters: Chuo Ward, Tokyo; President: Takayuki Hashimoto; NYSE: IBM; hereafter, IBM Japan) will work together in providing solutions to achieve optimization and automation in the field of online marketing, which is becoming increasingly diversified and complex.
With the increasing importance in business activities of marketing and business transactions utilizing the Web, online marketing has become highly complex due to the diversification of marketing channels represented by social media, and the diversification of devices due to the prevalence of smartphones and tablets, etc. It has become increasingly important for businesses to not limit analysis to points such as website access status and advertising effectiveness, but to use analysis data in a strategic way, and to optimize overall online marketing by automating marketing activities
Now, for the first time in Japan, transcosmos and IBM Japan will provide a new solution focused on the “Coremetrics” SaaS solution, which supports optimization of online marketing. With the collaboration of the two companies in this field, combining the Web analysis and online marketing operation know-how of transcosmos, and the enterprise software operation, mainframe system construction and global marketing know-how of IBM Japan, we will support the optimization and automation of corporate marketing.
Coremetrics is able to accumulate and analyze information for all users visiting a website, including the entry channel and activity, in a chronological and integrated manner. By segmenting uniformly managed data for each user, it is possible to gain greater insight from the user’s perspective. In addition, it provides linked solutions such as e-mail distribution and recommendations to support automation of marketing activities in order to enhance relationships with users.


Specific details of the collaboration between the two companies are as follows.

Awareness campaign for the market
              Beginning in June, both companies will collaborate in holding seminars and other events as a campaign to familiarize businesses with the importance and necessity of optimization and automation in the new field of online marketing.
Establishment of a demonstration center
              Both companies will collaborate to set up an environment where customers can experience the optimization and automation of online marketing with Coremetrics at transcosmos facilities (Shibuya-ku, Tokyo) beginning on May 9.
New organization
              Both companies will establish full-time teams in order to conduct consistent sales and support of Coremetrics.
