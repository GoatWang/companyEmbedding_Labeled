We strive to introduce advanced production equipment and tools in eight areas: metalcutting machinery; metalforming machinery; measuring instruments; professional tools; equipment for the electronics industry; rapid prototyping systems; EDM and CNC wire-cutting machinery, and education training machinery and software.Leeport is a supplier of over 50 world-famous brands. We have longstanding relations with our suppliers; in fact we have been working with some of them for more than 20 or 30 years. The equipment that we offer caters for all segments of the manufacturing industry, including mould-making, electronics, industrial machinery, automobiles, aerospace, telecommunications, home appliances, toys, clocks & watches, infrastructure, switch gear and metal parts.As a result of our concerted efforts, we have gained recognition from international organisations. In January 2002, Leeport was awarded ISO 9001:2000 certification, and in July 2003, we were successfully listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.In October 2005, Leeport opened an Advanced Manufacturing Technology Centre at Futian Free Trade Zone in Shenzhen, showcasing the whole range of products we offer. The centre serves dual purposes — it offers one-stop-shop services to customers and acts as a platform for the academic and industrial sectors to exchange knowledge. In addition to the Shenzhen technology centre, Leeport has also set up Metrology Solution Centres in Dongguan, Shanghai and Beijing to provide comprehensive metrology services to our Chinese customers.
