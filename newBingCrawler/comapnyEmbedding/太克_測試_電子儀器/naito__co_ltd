Floader the amphibious self-propelled boat launcher






Dock on the Water and Store your Boat on Dry Land with this Revolutionary Self-Propelled Electric Boat Launcher
Enjoy your boating to the fullest by simply driving your boat directly into the water from your home or vacation home anytime you like. 



The Benefits of our Floader:
         An Amphibious Self-Propelled Boat Launcher




				Set sail and come back to dry land without ever having to get in the water or rely on a helping hand.
The electric-powered Floader is designed for a single person to be able to set sail and return to dry land without ever having to get in the water.
All you have to do is get on your boat while still on dry land and drive it straight into the water. When done with your excursion, simply dock with the Floader while still out on the water and drive it right back ashore.





				Easily access the ocean even in locations not fitted with boating cranes. 
Your access to the water will no longer be limited to locations with boating cranes. With this revolutionary amphibious, self-propelled boat launcher, all you need is a beach or slope to drive your Floader and boat straight into the water. 





				Store your boat on dry land and reduce your maintenance expenses.
Give yourself the peace of mind by driving your boat to safety with the Floader when a storm hits. Furthermore, because you can store your boat on dry land, you will reduce the cost of antifouling paint and other various maintenance expenses. 





				Simple to maintain and completely rustproof 
The primary functions of the Floader are driven by a mechanical link that is designed to be submerged and reduce the need for maintenance. The frame of the Floader is hot-dip galvanized for rustproofing.





				Contributing to the Coast Guard, firefighters, and dam maintenance.
Having property along the beach side or any waterfront will maximize the Floader's potential and your enjoyment. 
The Coast Guard, firefighters, and dam safety offices have selected to use the Floader.





Operating the Floader





Park the Floader on the water by simply anchoring it. Then release the power cable and ropes.





Drive the Floader into the water via beach or slope.





Once the boat and Floader are floating in the water, use your boat's propulsion to move about the water.





Anchor the Floader once you find a safe place to park it on the water. Return the controller to the motor housing and untie the ropes holding your boat in place.





Back up slowly as your boat floats away from the Floader.





When coming back, slowly maneuver your boat into the Floader from downwind. (The anchored Floader automatically floats facing upwind.)





Tie your boat to the Floader with the ropes on both sides of the boat to hold it in place. Reel in the anchor and head towards dry land.





Come back ashore using the drivetrain of the Floader's wheels and your boat's propulsion system.





Driving Couldn't be Any Easier!





Toggle the joystick on the controller to maneuver yourself in any direction.




Client Testimonial


Be astounded to see the Floader in action.
Takao Otani
			Olympic Judge for Sail Boat Racing



Be astounded to see the Floader in action.
                You will need a bit of seaman-ship to assess the direction of the wind, your boat drifting sideways, etc. but using the Floader is so easy and smooth. Furthermore, the Floader relieves you of the difficulty in reversing your trailer, problems with slippery or rough slopes, and the hassle to abide by the marina’s operational hours and having to pay their expensive fees.
If your house is close to the water front, the Floader will completely revolutionize your boating life style. Jump on your boat any time you want and be away, out on open water.
