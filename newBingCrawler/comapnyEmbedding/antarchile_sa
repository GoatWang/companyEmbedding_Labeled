 The goal of this report is to assist managers in gauging a company's financial performance vis-a-vis firms competing in the same sector, at the global level.  In particular, this report covers ANTARCHILE S.A., SANTIAGO, Chile. With the globalization of markets, greater foreign competition, and the reduction of entry barriers, it becomes all the more important to benchmark a company's performance against other firms on a worldwide basis.  Doing so, however, is not an obvious task.  First, one needs to find firms competing in the same sector.  Second, one needs to control for exchange rate volatility.  Finally, one needs to use comparable financial standards.  This report overcomes these issues and gives full financial benchmarks vis-a-vis worldwide competitors who are present in the same narrow industrial classification. Benchmarks cover assets, liabilities, income and ratios.  Since our reports are printed on demand, the statistics reported are for the latest quarter and are the most up to date available (4 reports are produced each year). Each report provides over 100 statistics and 40 graphs to the reader.

From the Publisher


For over 20,000 companies, Icon Group uses a proprietary methodology to generate international benchmarks and measure gaps that might be revealed from such an exercise. First, for a given company Icon Group searches across over 26,000 firms for others producing similar products, offering similar services, or are in the same stage of the value chain for a particular industrial classification.  We then collect the financials for each of these firms and standardize these into comparable categories (assets, liabilities, income and ratios).  From there, we eliminate all currency effects by standardizing within each category and country.  All benchmarks are updated quarterly.

History[edit]
SQM, the latest guise of an Anglo-Chilean Nitrate and Railway Company which had been formed by London businessmen in 1882, was founded in 1968 to reorganize the Chilean nitrate industry. Initially, its ownership was shared between the Chilean state and the Compañía Nitratera Anglo Lautaro S.A. During a second phase of reorganisation, the industry was nationalised, and was thus fully owned by the Chilean state. In response to the 1970s wave of neoliberalism, a process of privatisation started in 1983 and was successfully completed in 1988.

To transport nitrates from its mines to the port, SQM operated a 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge railway from María Elena to Tocopilla. The railway consisted of two sections; a diesel line to Barriles (parts of which were once electrified), and an electrified line down to Tocopilla, which was very steep at around 4%, and included a switchback (locomotives were run around the train). All trains changed locomotives at Barriles. Per year, the railway transported 1.1 million tons of finished product to the port of Tocopilla and 12 million tons of caliche ore from various mining sites to the Pedro de Valdivia plant.[1]
In August 2015 unprecedented flash flooding caused numerous washouts on the electric section of the railroad, most notably the area around the switchback on the escarpment leading down to the port at Tocopilla. As a result of this, along with the closure of the Pedro Valdivia mine/plant, the railroad ceased all operations, both electric and diesel, in late November 2015. All railroad staff were laid off and all railroad equipment stored at Tocopilla and Maria Elena awaiting possible sale or scrapping. The end of a historic railway. Trucks are now hauling product from Maria Elena/Coya Sur plants to the port.
"The SQM Affair"[edit]
People associated with former senior managers in the company were in 2016 and 2017 investigated by the Chilean national police in relation to allegations of tax evasion and bribery. This investigation was referred to by La Nación, a major Chilean newspaper, as "the SQM Affair".[2]

Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island. Chile also claims about 480,000 square miles of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. According to OECD, in Chile, the average net adjusted disposable income of the top 20% of the population is an estimated $31,040/ year, whereas the bottom 20% earn an estimated $2,392/ year. Today Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations. It leads Latin American nations in human development, competitiveness, income per-capita, globalization, state of peace, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption. It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state, and democratic development. Chile is a founding member of the United Nations, the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.

PEST Analysis of Chile

 

Political environment



In terms of tax policies, Chile has international trade regulations and restrictions, Chile has a trade with the European Union, therefore the traders and manufacturers can sell this product in every country who below it. Competition regulation, this factor is important for example in countries where the alcohol is controlled by the government. One example of this is Finland, because there is only one Alcohol Store what it means a Monopoly. In Chile if we present a well-prepared business plan, we can get access a investments and seed capital. There is no influence, because of the fact that it is just going to buy the Chilean product and sell it in a certain market. And about the process it is not necessary use too much technology. The current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite regarded as highly irregular by some observers, in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 13 December 2009. None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50% of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, competed in a run-off election on 17 January 2010. Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port Callao for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836–39) in the War of the Confederation.  



 

Economical Environment


Chile’s GDP grew at an annual rate of around 7% during the 1990s, decelerating toward the end of the decade and the beginning of the 21st century as a result of the Asian financial crisis. The rapid growth rates in the 1990s meant that Chile practically doubled its output between 1987 and 1998. In recent years the country has returned to the high growth rates of the 1990s. In 2004 and 2005 GDP grew by 6% and 5.6% respectively. The GDP growth of the country was registered at 4.3% and 5.1% in 2006 and 2007. Household net-adjusted disposable income is the amount of money that a household earns each year after tax. It represents the money available to a household for spending on goods or services. In Chile, the average household net-adjusted disposable income is 8 618 USD a year, lower than the OECD average of $22,387. Household financial wealth is the total value of a household’s financial worth. In Chile, the average household wealth is estimated at 15 355 USD, lower than the OECD average of $36,238. However, higher energy prices and lagging consumer demand slowed the economy in 2006, although high copper prices in 2007 had a positive effect. The impact of the global economic crisis and falling commodity prices resulted in Chilean GDP growth declining to 3.1% in 2008. The country went through recession in 2009, with the economy contracting by 1.7%. However, due to prudent policies the economy grew by over 5.2% in 2010.


 

Social Environment



The economy of Chile is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank and is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations leading Latin American nations in human development, competitiveness, income per-capita, globalization, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption. The income distribution and the level of income in Europe is higher than Chile and is still increasing, then it is understand that one can sell this product a higher price than Chile. Furthermore, Pisco is a typical beverage from Chile and we could take advantage from Chilean Wine, by which has a good reception in the whole world. Demographics, Population, etc, this product is aimed to a specific market, for instance, young people and adult who likes to test strong drinks. Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high level of foreign trade and a reputation for strong financial institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating in South America. Chile allows free trade. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Chile was worth $248.59 billion in 2011. The GDP value of Chile represents 0.40 percent of the world economy as reported by the World Bank Group. Exports account for more than one-third of GDP, with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of government revenue. Just recently, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Chile expanded 5.7% in the third quarter of 2012 over the same quarter of the previous year. as reported by the Banco Central de Chile. Historically, from 1987 until 2012, Chile GDP Annual Growth Rate averaged 5.5% reaching an all time high of 16.2% in September of 1992.



 

Technological Environment



Chile remains the most competitive economy in the region. Early measures to open and liberalize its markets by introducing high levels of domestic and foreign competition, a relatively flexible labor market, and one of the most sophisticated and efficient financial markets have also helped the country to maintain its long- term growth prospects in the past decades. As Chile moves quickly toward higher levels of rent and the next stage of development, companies with low investment in R&D and a weak capacity for innovation act in an innovation environment characterized by relatively low-quality scientific research institutions and weak university-industry collaboration in R&D. Making sufficient progress on this front is the major challenge that Chile will face in the next decade.
