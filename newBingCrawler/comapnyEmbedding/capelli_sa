We believe there is no responsible alternative to doing business other than through the pursuit of Environmental sustainability and this belief guides every decision we make.
We find inspirantion for doing so in nature and believe that Nature is not merely something to be cherished and protected, but also should be emulated as a model of sustainability.
Rica carries out every single phase of the processes that take a product from the original concept to its final sale.
All production processes, quality control and distribution come from within Rica facilities, eliminating the need for a supply chain, without any intermediaries in the stages of research, production or marketing. This ensures a limited environmental impact thanks to fewer working stages, reduced emission of carbon dioxide and limited and concentrated use of resources: all this substantially reduces the amount of pollution.
Shortened distances, processes and stages of production help the environment, and guarantee our customers superior quality control.
