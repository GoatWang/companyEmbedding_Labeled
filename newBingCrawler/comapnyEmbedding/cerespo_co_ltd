When I was placing my order I was unsure if my Visa card was authorised for the transaction and was unsure

                         if my payment would be successful.
One minute after I inserted the VISA for payment I had a call from Claire from Research and Markets outlining there was a problem with my card and offering me different solutions to overcome that issue.

It was a great customer experience that clearly surprised me in a very positive way. I shared the experience with some of my colleagues at the office. thanks for your quick and efficient service!
