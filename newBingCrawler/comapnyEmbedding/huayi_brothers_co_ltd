History[edit]
The company was founded in 1994 as a film production company. It underwent a comprehensive expansion into the media industry through investing and now produces and operates movies, TV shows, talent agencies, music labels, and movie theaters.[4] In February 2011, Huayi Brothers revealed their plans to create the largest TV and film studio complex in East Asia.[5] Also, they announced that they aim to earn 10 billion yuan in the box office by 2016.[6] As of April 2015, the company was worth US$7.9 billion.[7]
In 2014 the company announced that it had agreed to invest as much as $150 million in Studio 8, the production company launched by former Warner Bros. executive Jeff Robinov, but the partnership never materialized. Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun International later signed a deal to invest in Robinov's company instead.[8]
