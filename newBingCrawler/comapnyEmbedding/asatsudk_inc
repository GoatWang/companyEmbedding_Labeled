“NUMBERS”
        The most commonly used codes in the world.

        This is an art project to make one and only clock with creative numbers collecting from around the world.
        Using “numbers” is the only rule to limit you,
        otherwise you are completely free to bring your own unique ideas and individuality.

        In the project collaborating with eyeka, it received 279 entries from 44 countries.
        The best and brightest works contributed to create the clock.

        We expect this project will go viral while planning to arrange events like workshops.

        Keep your eye on this content –  it is further developing.

        Join us to make time together.
