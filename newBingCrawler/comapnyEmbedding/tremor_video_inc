Mr. Zagorski oversaw the sale of eXelate to Nielsen in March 2015, and continued to manage the business following the acquisition. Prior to eXelate, Mr. Zagorski held leadership positions at WorldNow and MediaSpan, where he oversaw strategy, marketing and business development.

Mark's deep knowledge of the digital advertising industry, and his role in shaping industry data practices that empower premium publishers and enhance advertiser performance make him the right fit for Tremor Video,' said Paul Caine. 'Mark joins us following record results in 2016 for the company and a very strong first quarter. I have great confidence that Mark is the right leader for Tremor Video as we continue to build on our momentum, deliver strong results and drive shareholder value.'

Incentive Plan (the “ Plan ”) and the
Share Reserve, but is subject to the terms and conditions of the
Plan (with the exception of Section 3) as if the option had been
granted under the Plan.  The option is granted to you
effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice
(the “ Date of Grant ”).  If there
is any conflict between the terms in this Option Agreement and the
relevant terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.
Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Option Agreement
(including Annex A attached hereto) or in the Grant Notice but
defined in the Plan will have the same definitions as in the
Plan.
 

The details of your option, in
addition to those set forth in the Grant Notice and the Plan, are
as follows:
 

1.                                      
VESTING.   Your option will vest as provided in your
Grant Notice.  Vesting will cease upon the termination of your
Continuous Service.  In addition, if, during the term of your
Continuous Service, a Change in Control (as defined in Annex A) is
consummated and, within 12 months following the consummation of
such Change in Control, you are subject to an Involuntary
Termination (as defined in Annex A) 50% of the then-unvested
portion of this option shall vest.
 

2.                                      
NUMBER OF SHARES AND EXERCISE
PRICE.   The number
of shares of Common Stock subject to your option and the exercise
price per share in your Grant Notice will be adjusted for
Capitalization Adjustments as provided in the Plan.
 

3.                                      
EXERCISE RESTRICTION FOR
NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES.   If you are an Employee eligible for
overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,
as amended (that is, a “ Non-Exempt Employee
”), and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, you may not
exercise your option until you have completed at least six (6)
months of Continuous Service measured from the Date of Grant, even
if you have already been an employee for more than six (6) months.
Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, you may exercise your option as to any vested portion prior to
such six (6) month anniversary in the case of (i) your death or
disability, (ii) a Corporate Transaction in which your option is
not assumed, continued or substituted, (iii) a Change in Control or
(iv) your termination of Continuous Service on your
“retirement” (as defined in the Company’s benefit
plans).
 
1 





 

4.                                      
EXERCISE PRIOR TO VESTING
(“EARLY EXERCISE”).   You may not exercise your option prior to
vesting.
 

5.                                      
METHOD OF PAYMENT.
  You must pay the full amount
of the exercise price for the shares you wish to exercise. 
You may pay the exercise price in cash or by check, bank draft or
money order payable to the Company or in any other manner
permitted by your Grant Notice, which may include one
or more of the following:
 

(a)                                 
Provided that at the time of
exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded, and if the Company
has established such a program, pursuant to a program developed
under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board
that, prior to the issuance of Common Stock, results in either the
receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of
irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the
Company from the sales proceeds.  This manner of payment is
also known as a “broker-assisted exercise”, “same
day sale”, or “sell to cover”.
 

(b)                                 
Provided that at the time of
exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded, and subject to the
consent of the Company at the time of exercise, by delivery to the
Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of already-owned
shares of Common Stock that are owned free and clear of any liens,
claims, encumbrances or security interests, and that are valued at
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. 
“Delivery” for these purposes, in the sole discretion
of the Company at the time you exercise your option, will include
delivery to the Company of your attestation of ownership of such
shares of Common Stock in a form approved by the Company.  You
may not exercise your option by delivery to the Company of Common
Stock if doing so would violate the provisions of any law,
regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the
Company’s stock.
 

(c)                                  
If your option is a Nonstatutory
Stock Option, subject to the consent of the Company at the time of
exercise, by a “net exercise” arrangement pursuant to
which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock
issued upon exercise of your option by the largest whole number of
shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate
exercise price.  You must pay any remaining balance of the
aggregate exercise price not satisfied by the “net
exercise” in cash or other permitted form of payment. 
Shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under your
option and will not be exercisable thereafter if those shares (i)
are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net
exercise,” (ii) are delivered to you as a result of such
exercise, and (iii) are withheld to satisfy your tax withholding
obligations.
 

6.                                      
WHOLE SHARES.
  You may exercise your option
only for whole shares of Common Stock.
 

7.                                      
SECURITIES LAW
COMPLIANCE.   In no
event may you exercise your option unless the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise are then registered under the
Securities Act or, if not registered, the Company has determined
that your exercise and the issuance of the shares would be exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  The
exercise of your option also must comply with all other applicable
laws and regulations governing your option, including the
Company’s insider trading and blackout policies, and
you
 
2 





 
may not exercise your option if the Company
determines that such exercise would not be in material compliance
with such laws and regulations (including any restrictions on
exercise required for compliance with Treas. Reg. 1.401(k)-1(d)(3),
if applicable).
 

8.                                      
TERM.   You may not exercise your option before
the Date of Grant or after the expiration of the option’s
term.  The term of your option expires, subject to the
provisions of Section 5(h) of the Plan, upon the earliest of the
following:
 

(a)                                 
immediately upon the termination of
your Continuous Service for Cause;
 

(b)                                 
twelve (12) months after the
termination of your Continuous Service if you are terminated by the
Company without Cause (as defined in Annex A);
 

(c)                                  
three (3) months after the
termination of your Continuous Service for any reason other than
termination by the Company for Cause, termination by the Company
without Cause, your Disability or your death (except as otherwise
provided in Section 8(d) below); provided, however, that if
during any part of such three (3) month period your option is not
exercisable solely because doing so would violate the registration
requirements under the Securities Act, your option will not expire
until the earlier of the Expiration Date or until it has been
exercisable for an aggregate period of three (3) months after the
termination of your Continuous Service; provided further, if
during any part of such three (3) month period, the sale of any
Common Stock received upon exercise of your option would violate
the Company’s insider trading policy, then your option will
not expire until the earlier of the Expiration Date or until it has
been exercisable for an aggregate period of three (3) months after
the termination of your Continuous Service during which the sale of
the Common Stock received upon exercise of your option would not be
in violation of the Company’s insider trading policy. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) you are a Non-Exempt
Employee, (ii) your Continuous Service terminates within six (6)
months after the Date of Grant, and (iii) you have vested in a
portion of your option at the time of your termination of
Continuous Service, your option will not expire until the earlier
of (x) the later of (A) the date that is seven (7) months after the
Date of Grant, and (B) the date that is three (3) months after the
termination of your Continuous Service, and (y) the Expiration
Date;
 

(d)                                 
twelve (12) months after the
termination of your Continuous Service due to your Disability
(except as otherwise provided in Section 8(d)) below;
 

(e)                                  
eighteen (18) months after your
death if you die either during your Continuous Service or within
three (3) months after your Continuous Service terminates for any
reason other than Cause;
 

(f)                                   
the Expiration Date indicated in
your Grant Notice; or
 

(g)                                 
the day before the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Date of Grant.
 
3 





 

9.                                      
EXERCISE.
 

(a)                                 
You may exercise the vested portion
of your option during its term by (i) delivering a Notice of
Exercise (in a form designated by the Company), or making the
required electronic election with the Company’s designated
broker, and (ii) paying the exercise price and any applicable
withholding taxes to the Company’s, stock plan administrator,
or such other person as the Company may designate, together with
such additional documents as the Company may then
require.
 

(b)                                 
By exercising your option you agree
that, as a condition to any exercise of your option, the Company
may require you to enter into an arrangement providing for the
payment by you to the Company of any tax withholding obligation of
the Company arising by reason of (i) the exercise of your option,
(ii) the lapse of any substantial risk of forfeiture to which the
shares of Common Stock are subject at the time of exercise, or
(iii) the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired upon such
exercise.
 

10.                               
TRANSFERABILITY.
  Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 10, your option is not transferable, except by will
or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable
during your life only by you.
 

(a)                                 
Certain Trusts.
  Upon receiving written
permission from the Board or its duly authorized designee, you may
transfer your option to a trust if you are considered to be the
sole beneficial owner (determined under Section 671 of the Code and
applicable state law) while the option is held in the trust. 
You and the trustee must enter into transfer and other agreements
required by the Company.
 

(b)                                 
Domestic Relations
Orders.   Upon
receiving written permission from the Board or its duly authorized
designee, and provided that you and the designated transferee enter
into transfer and other agreements required by the Company, you may
transfer your option pursuant to the terms of a domestic relations
order, official marital settlement agreement or other divorce or
separation instrument as permitted by Treasury Regulation
1.421-1(b)(2) that contains the information required by the Company
to effectuate the transfer.  You are encouraged to discuss the
proposed terms of any division of this option with the Company
prior to finalizing the domestic relations order or marital
settlement agreement to help ensure the required information is
contained within the domestic relations order or marital settlement
agreement.
 

(c)                                  
Beneficiary
Designation.   Upon
receiving written permission from the Board or its duly authorized
designee, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in
a form approved by the Company and any broker designated by the
Company to handle option exercises, designate a third party who, on
your death, will thereafter be entitled to exercise this option and
receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such
exercise.  In the absence of such a designation, your executor
or administrator of your estate will be entitled to exercise this
option and receive, on behalf of your estate, the Common Stock or
other consideration resulting from such exercise.
 

11.                               
OPTION NOT A SERVICE
CONTRACT.
 

(a)                                 
Nothing in this Option Agreement
(including, but not limited to, the vesting of your option or the
issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of your
option),
 
4 





 
the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair
dealing that may be found implicit in this Option Agreement or the
Plan shall: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ
of, or affiliation with, the Company or an Affiliate; (ii)
constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate
regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work
assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of
employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under
this Option Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has
specifically accrued under the terms of this Option Agreement or
Plan; or (iv) deprive the Company of the right to terminate you at
will and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you
may have.
 

(b)                                 
The Company has the right to
reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of
its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as
it deems appropriate (a “ reorganization
”).  Such a reorganization could result in the
termination of your Continuous Service, or the termination of
Affiliate status of your employer and the loss of benefits
available to you under this Option Agreement, including but not
limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in
your option. This Option Agreement, the Plan, the transactions
contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein or
any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found
implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied
promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for
the term of this Option Agreement, for any period, or at all, and
shall not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to
conduct a reorganization.
 

12.                               
WITHHOLDING
OBLIGATIONS.
 

(a)                                 
At the time you exercise your
option, in whole or in part, and at any time thereafter as the
Company requests, you hereby authorize withholding from payroll and
any other amounts payable to you, and otherwise agree to make
adequate provision for (including by means of a “same day
sale” pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as
promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board to the extent permitted by
the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state,
local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or any
Affiliate that arise in connection with the exercise of your
option.
 

(b)                                 
Upon your request and subject to
approval by the Company, and compliance with any applicable legal
conditions or restrictions, the Company may withhold from fully
vested shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to you upon the
exercise of your option a number of whole shares of Common Stock
having a Fair Market Value, determined by the Company as of the
date of exercise, not in excess of the minimum amount of tax
required to be withheld by law (or such lower amount as may be
necessary to avoid classification of your option as a liability for
financial accounting purposes).
 

(c)                                  
You may not exercise your option
unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and any
Affiliate are satisfied.  Accordingly, you may not be able to
exercise your option when desired even though your option is
vested, and the Company will have no obligation to issue a
certificate for shares of Common Stock or release such shares of
Common Stock from any escrow provided for herein, if applicable,
unless such obligations are satisfied.
 
5 





 

13.                               
TAX CONSEQUENCES
. You hereby agree that the Company
does not have a duty to design or administer the Plan or its other
compensation programs in a manner that minimizes your tax
liabilities. You will not make any claim against the Company, or
any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates related to
tax liabilities arising from your option or your other
compensation. In particular, you acknowledge that your option is
exempt from Section 409A of the Code only if the exercise price per
share specified in the Grant Notice is at least equal to the
“fair market value” per share of the Common Stock on
the Date of Grant and there is no other impermissible deferral of
compensation associated with the option.
 

14.                               
NOTICES.   Any notices provided for in your option
or the Plan will be given in writing (including electronically) and
will be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of
notices delivered by mail by the Company to you, five (5) days
after deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you
at the last address you provided to the Company.  The Company
may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents
related to participation in the Plan and your option by electronic
means or to request your consent to participate in the Plan by
electronic means.  By accepting your option, you consent to
receive such documents by electronic delivery and to participate in
the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and
maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the
Company.
 

15.                               
GOVERNING PLAN
DOCUMENT.   Except
as stated in your Grant Notice and herein, your option is subject
to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are
hereby made a part of your option, and is further subject to all
interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations, which may from
time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. 
If there is any conflict between the provisions of your option and
the relevant provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan
will control.  In addition, your option (and any compensation
paid or shares issued under your option) is subject to recoupment
in accordance with The Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and any implementing regulations
thereunder, any clawback policy adopted by the Company and any
compensation recovery policy otherwise required by applicable
law.  No recovery of compensation under such a clawback policy
will be an event giving rise to a right to resign for “good
reason” or for a “constructive termination” (or
similar term) under any agreement with the Company.
 

16.                               
OTHER DOCUMENTS
.  You hereby acknowledge
receipt of and the right to receive a document providing the
information required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the
Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus.  In
addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s policy
permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during certain
“window” periods and the Company’s insider
trading policy, in effect from time to time.
 

17.                               
EFFECT ON OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS .  The value
of your option will not be included as compensation, earnings,
salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating your
benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company
or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides.
The Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or
terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s
employee benefit plans.
 

18.                               
VOTING RIGHTS
.  You will not have voting or
any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to
the shares to be issued pursuant to your option until such shares
are issued to you.  Upon such issuance, you will obtain full
voting and other rights as a stockholder
 
6 





 
of the Company.  Nothing contained in your
option, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create
or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between you and the Company or any other
person.
 

19.                               
SEVERABILITY
.  If all or any part of this
Option Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or
governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness
or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Option
Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. 
Any Section of this Option Agreement (or part of such a Section) so
declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed
in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or
part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining
lawful and valid.
 

20.                               
MISCELLANEOUS
.
 

(a)                                 
The rights and obligations of the
Company under your option will be transferable to any one or more
persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder
will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the
Company’s successors and assigns.
 

(b)                                 
You agree upon request to execute
any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in the
sole determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or
intent of your option.
 

(c)                                  
You acknowledge and agree that you
have reviewed your option in its entirety, have had an opportunity
to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting
your option, and fully understand all provisions of your
option.
 

(d)                                 
This Option Agreement will be
subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such
approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities
exchanges as may be required.
 

(e)                                  
All obligations of the Company under
the Plan and this Option Agreement will be binding on any successor
to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the
result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company.
 
*            *            *
 
This Option Agreement will be deemed to be
signed by you upon the signing by you of the Stock Option Grant
Notice to which it is attached.

the shares of the surviving or resulting corporation), (ii) a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or

Company without Cause or (ii) by Participant for Good

“Good Reason” unless Participant give the Company
written notice of the condition within 90 days after the condition
comes into existence,
 
8 





 
the Company fails to remedy the condition within

of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and
(F) the Fair Market Value applicable to a Stock
Award.
 

(ii)                                
To construe and interpret the Plan
and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke
rules and regulations for administration of the Plan and
Awards.
 





 
The Board, in the exercise of these powers, may
correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any
Award Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash
Award, in a manner and to the extent it will deem necessary or
expedient to make the Plan or Award fully effective.
 

(iii)                            
To settle all controversies
regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
 

(iv)                             
To accelerate, in whole or in part,
the time at which an Award may be exercised or vest (or the time at
which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued in settlement
thereof).
 

(v)                                 
To suspend or terminate the Plan at
any time.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an
Award Agreement, suspension or termination of the Plan will not
materially impair a Participant’s rights under the
Participant’s then-outstanding Award without the
Participant’s written consent, except as provided in
subsection (viii) below.
 

(vi)                             
To amend the Plan in any respect the
Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation,
by adopting amendments relating to Incentive Stock Options and
certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A
of the Code and/or bringing the Plan or Awards granted under the
Plan into compliance with the requirements for Incentive Stock
Options or ensuring that they are exempt from, or compliant with,
the requirements for nonqualified deferred compensation under
Section 409A of the Code, subject to the limitations, if any,
of applicable law.  If required by applicable law or listing
requirements, and except as provided in
Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the
Company will seek stockholder approval of any amendment of the Plan
that (A) materially increases the number of shares of Common
Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (B) materially
expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (C) materially increases the benefits accruing to
Participants under the Plan, (D) materially reduces the price
at which shares of Common Stock may be issued or purchased under
the Plan, (E) materially extends the term of the Plan, or
(F) materially expands the types of Awards available for
issuance under the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan
or an Award Agreement, no amendment of the Plan will materially
impair a Participant’s rights under an outstanding Award
without the Participant’s written consent.
 

(vii)                         
To submit any amendment to the Plan
for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments
to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of
(A) Section 162(m) of the Code regarding the
exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on
corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees,
(B) Section 422 of the Code regarding “incentive
stock options” or (C) Rule 16b-3.
 

(viii)                     
To approve forms of Award Agreements
for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more
Awards, including, but not limited to, amendments to provide terms
more favorable to the Participant than previously provided in the
Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits in the Plan that
are not subject to Board discretion; provided, however, that
a Participant’s rights under any Award will not be impaired
by any such amendment unless (A) the Company requests the
consent of the affected Participant, and (B) such Participant
consents in writing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(1) a Participant’s rights

 
2 






 
will not be deemed to have been impaired by any
such amendment if the Board, in its sole discretion, determines
that the amendment, taken as a whole, does not materially impair
the Participant’s rights, and (2) subject to the
limitations of applicable law, if any, the Board may amend the
terms of any one or more Awards without the affected
Participant’s consent (A) to maintain the qualified
status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option under
Section 422 of the Code; (B) to change the terms of an
Incentive Stock Option, if such change results in impairment of the
Award solely because it impairs the qualified status of the Award
as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code;
(C) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the
Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code; or
(D) to comply with other applicable laws or listing
requirements.
 

(ix)                             
Generally, to exercise such powers
and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient
to promote the best interests of the Company and that are not in
conflict with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
 

(x)                                 
To adopt such procedures and
sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation
in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign
nationals or employed outside the United States (provided that
Board approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications
to the Plan or any Award Agreement that are required for compliance
with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction).
 

(xi)                             
To effect, with the consent of any
adversely affected Participant, (A) the reduction of the
exercise, purchase or strike price of any outstanding Stock Award;
(B) the cancellation of any outstanding Stock Award and the
grant in substitution therefor of a new (1) Option or SAR,
(2)  Restricted Stock Award, (3) Restricted Stock Unit
Award, (4) Other Stock Award, (5) cash and/or
(6) other valuable consideration determined by the Board, in
its sole discretion, with any such substituted award
(x) covering the same or a different number of shares of
Common Stock as the cancelled Stock Award and (y) granted
under the Plan or another equity or compensatory plan of the
Company; or (C) any other action that is treated as a
repricing under generally accepted accounting
principles.
 

(c)                                  
Delegation to
Committee.
 

(i)                                    
General.   The Board may delegate some or all of the
administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees.  If
administration of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the
Committee will have, in connection with the administration of the
Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been
delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a
subcommittee of the Committee any of the administrative powers the
Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to
the Board will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee, as
applicable).  Any delegation of administrative powers will be
reflected in resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Plan, adopted from time to time by the Board or Committee (as
applicable).  The Board may retain the authority to
concurrently administer the Plan with the Committee and may, at any
time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously
delegated.
 
3 





 

(ii)                                
Section 162(m) and
Rule 16b-3 Compliance.   The Committee may consist solely of two
or more Outside Directors, in accordance with
Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more
Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with
Rule 16b-3.
 

(d)                                 
Delegation to an
Officer.   The Board
may delegate to one (1) or more Officers the authority to do
one or both of the following (i) designate Employees who are
not Officers to be recipients of Options and SARs (and, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, other Stock Awards) and, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the terms of such Awards, and
(ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be
subject to such Stock Awards granted to such Employees;
provided, however , that the Board resolutions regarding
such delegation will specify the total number of shares of Common
Stock that may be subject to the Stock Awards granted by such
Officer and that such Officer may not grant a Stock Award to
himself or herself.  Any such Stock Awards will be granted on
the form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by
the Committee or the Board, unless otherwise provided in the
resolutions approving the delegation authority.  The Board may
not delegate authority to an Officer who is acting solely in the
capacity of an Officer (and not also as a Director) to determine
the Fair Market Value pursuant to
Section 13(x)(iii) below.
 

(e)                                  
Effect of Board’s
Decision. All
determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board
in good faith will not be subject to review by any person and will
be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.
 
3.                                      
SHARES SUBJECT TO THE
PLAN.
 

(a)                                 
Share Reserve. 
Subject to
Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, and
the following sentence regarding the annual increase, the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to
Stock Awards will not exceed 6,377,513 shares (the “
Share Reserve ”), which number is the sum of:
(1) 1,333,333 shares approved by the stockholders on
June 12, 2013, plus (2) an aggregate of 4,044,180
shares added pursuant to automatic increases that occurred on
January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, plus
(3) 1,000,000 shares approved by the stockholders on
May 29, 2015.  In addition, the Share Reserve will
automatically increase on January 1 st  of
each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on
January 1 st
 of the year following the year
in which the IPO Date occurs and ending on (and including)
January 1, 2023, in an amount equal to 4% of the total number
of shares of Capital Stock outstanding on December 31
st  of the preceding calendar year. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may act prior to
January 1 st
 of a given year to provide
that there will be no January 1 st  increase in the Share Reserve for such
year or that the increase in the Share Reserve for such year will
be a lesser number of shares of Common Stock than would otherwise
occur pursuant to the preceding sentence.  For clarity, the
Share Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the
number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the
Plan.  Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit
the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in
Section 7(a).  Shares may be issued in connection with a
merger or acquisition as permitted by NASDAQ Listing
Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or
other applicable rule, and such issuance will not reduce the number
of shares available for issuance under the Plan.
 
4 





 

(b)                                 
Reversion of Shares to the Share
Reserve.  If a Stock
Award or any portion thereof (i) expires or otherwise
terminates without all of the shares covered by such Stock Award
having been issued or (ii) is settled in cash ( i.e. ,
the Participant receives cash rather than stock), such expiration,
termination or settlement will not reduce (or otherwise offset) the
number of shares of Common Stock that may be available for issuance
under the Plan.  If any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant
to a Stock Award are forfeited back to or repurchased by the
Company because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition
required to vest such shares in the Participant, then the shares
that are forfeited or repurchased will revert to and again become
available for issuance under the Plan.  Any shares reacquired
by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on a
Stock Award or as consideration for the exercise or purchase price
of a Stock Award will again become available for issuance under the
Plan.
 

(c)                                  
Incentive Stock Option
Limit.  Subject to
the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options will be 53,333,333 shares of Common Stock.
 

(d)                                 
Section 162(m) Limitations
.  Subject to the provisions of
Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, at
such time as the Company may be subject to the applicable
provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, the following
limitations shall apply.
 

(i)                                    
A maximum of 6,666,666 shares of
Common Stock subject to Options, SARs and Other Stock Awards whose
value is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise or
strike price of at least 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date
the Stock Award is granted may be granted to any one Participant
during any one calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any additional Options, SARs or Other Stock Awards whose value
is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise or
strike price of at least 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date
the Stock Award are granted to any Participant during any calendar
year, compensation attributable to the exercise of such additional
Stock Awards will not satisfy the requirements to be considered
“qualified performance-based compensation” under
Section 162(m) of the Code unless such additional Stock
Award is approved by the Company’s stockholders.
 

(ii)                                
A maximum of 3,333,333 shares of
Common Stock subject to Performance Stock Awards may be granted to
any one Participant during any one calendar year (whether the
grant, vesting or exercise is contingent upon the attainment during
the Performance Period of the Performance Goals).
 

(iii)                            
A maximum of $10,000,000 may be
granted as a Performance Cash Award to any one Participant during
any one calendar year.
 

(e)                                  
Source of Shares.
  The stock issuable under the
Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common
Stock, including shares repurchased by the Company on the open
market or otherwise.
 
5 





 
4.                                      
ELIGIBILITY.
 

(a)                                 
Eligibility for Specific Stock
Awards .  Incentive
Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a
“parent corporation” or “subsidiary
corporation” thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections
424(e) and 424(f) of the Code).  Stock Awards other
than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors
and Consultants; provided, however , that Stock Awards may
not be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants who are
providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of
the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act, unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock
Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under
Section 409A of the Code (for example, because the Stock
Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate transaction such as a
spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in consultation with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are
otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or
(iii) the Company, in consultation with its legal counsel, has
determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
 

(b)                                 
Ten Percent
Stockholders.   A
Ten Percent Stockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock
Option unless the exercise price of such Option is at least 110% of
the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Option is not
exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of
grant.
 
5.                                      
PROVISIONS RELATING TO OPTIONS
AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
 

Each Option or SAR will be in such
form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems
appropriate.  All Options will be separately designated
Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time
of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate certificate
or certificates will be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased
on exercise of each type of Option.  If an Option is not
specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an
Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option but some portion
or all of the Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option
under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof)
will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The provisions of separate
Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however ,
that each Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of
provisions hereof by reference in the applicable Award Agreement or
otherwise) the substance of each of the following
provisions:
 

(a)                                 
Term.   Subject to the provisions of
Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no
Option or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten years
from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the
Award Agreement.
 

(b)                                 
Exercise Price.
  Subject to the provisions of
Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, the
exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will be not less
than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to
the Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with
an exercise or strike price lower than 100% of the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock subject to the Award if such Award is
granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another
option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a Corporate
Transaction and in a manner consistent with

 
6 






 
the provisions of Section 409A and, if
applicable, Section 424(a) of the Code.  Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock
equivalents.
 

(c)                                  
Purchase Price for
Options.   The
purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of
an Option may be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable law
and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any
combination of the methods of payment set forth below.  The
Board will have the authority to grant Options that do not permit
all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the
ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require
the consent of the Company to use a particular method of
payment.  The permitted methods of payment are as
follows:
 

(i)                                    
by cash, check, bank draft or money
order payable to the Company;
 

(ii)                                
pursuant to a program developed
under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board
that, prior to the issuance of the stock subject to the Option,
results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or
the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate
exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;
 

(iii)                            
by delivery to the Company (either
by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common
Stock;
 

(iv)                             
if an Option is a Nonstatutory Stock
Option, by a “net exercise” arrangement pursuant to
which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a
Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise
price; provided, however , that the Company will accept a
cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any
remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by
such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued. 
Shares of Common Stock will no longer be subject to an Option and
will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that
(A) shares issuable upon exercise are used to pay the exercise
price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares
are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise, and
(C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations; or
 

(v)                                 
in any other form of legal
consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in
the applicable Award Agreement.
 

(d)                                 
Exercise and Payment of a
SAR.   To exercise
any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of
exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the
Stock Appreciation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR.  The
appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a SAR will be
not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the
aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the
SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of
Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under
such SAR, and with respect to which the Participant is exercising
the SAR on such date, over (B) the aggregate strike price of
the number of Common Stock equivalents with respect to which the
Participant is exercising the SAR on such date.  The
appreciation distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in
any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration,
as determined by the Board and contained in the Award Agreement
evidencing such SAR.
 
7 





 

(e)                                  
Transferability of Options and
SARs.   The Board
may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on the
transferability of Options and SARs as the Board will
determine.  In the absence of such a determination by the
Board to the contrary, the following restrictions on the
transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 

(i)                                    
Restrictions on
Transfer.   An
Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution (or pursuant to subsections
(ii) and (iii) below), and will be exercisable during the
lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant.  The
Board may permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner that is
not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws.  Except
as explicitly provided in the Plan, neither an Option nor a SAR may
be transferred for consideration.
 

(ii)                                
Domestic Relations
Orders.   Subject to
the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, an Option
or SAR may be transferred pursuant to the terms of a domestic
relations order, official marital settlement agreement or other
divorce or separation instrument as permitted by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.421-1(b)(2).  If an Option is an
Incentive Stock Option, such Option may be deemed to be a
Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
 

(iii)                            
Beneficiary
Designation.  
Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
a Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in
a form approved by the Company (or the designated broker),
designate a third party who, on the death of the Participant, will
thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive
the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such
exercise.  In the absence of such a designation, upon the
death of the Participant, the executor or administrator of the
Participant’s estate will be entitled to exercise the Option
or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration
resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit
designation of a beneficiary at any time, including due to any
conclusion by the Company that such designation would be
inconsistent with the provisions of applicable laws.
 

(f)

Common Stock subject to
