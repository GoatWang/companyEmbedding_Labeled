06/06/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 06/06/2017 19:21
Tremor Video Appoints Industry Leader Mark Zagorski as Chief Executive Officer








        NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tremor Video, Inc. (NYSE:TRMR), a provider of software for video ad effectiveness, today announced that Mark Zagorski will be joining the company as its Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors. Mr. Zagorski most recently served as CEO of eXelate, a Nielsen Company, and EVP of Nielsen Marketing Cloud. In May of this year he was named by Adweek as one of the top 26 trailblazers in Marketing Technology. Mr. Zagorski will assume his new role at Tremor Video on July 10, 2017. Paul Caine, who led the CEO search committee as Interim CEO, will continue as Chairman of the Board following Mr. Zagorski's appointment.
      

        Mr. Zagorski is a seasoned, 25-year veteran of the digital advertising industry with a focus on data and analytics. Most recently, as CEO of eXelate, Mr. Zagorski was responsible for directing the development and marketing of its cloud platform, as well as driving the strategic vision of the company's industry-leading smart data engine. During his tenure at eXelate, he increased revenue tenfold, and was instrumental in the global expansion of eXelate's strategic TV, digital media metrics and artificial intelligence applications. Mr. Zagorski oversaw the sale of eXelate to Nielsen in March 2015, and continued to manage the business following the acquisition. Prior to eXelate, Mr. Zagorski held leadership positions at WorldNow and MediaSpan, where he oversaw strategy, marketing and business development.
      

        'On behalf of the entire Board, we are thrilled to welcome Mark to the Tremor Video executive team. Mark's deep knowledge of the digital advertising industry, and his role in shaping industry data practices that empower premium publishers and enhance advertiser performance make him the right fit for Tremor Video,' said Paul Caine. 'Mark joins us following record results in 2016 for the company and a very strong first quarter. I have great confidence that Mark is the right leader for Tremor Video as we continue to build on our momentum, deliver strong results and drive shareholder value.'
      

        'As someone who has been engaged with the evolution of digital video for over two decades, I've long admired Tremor Video as the most innovative leader in the premium video marketplace. Tremor Video has a strong reputation for pioneering video technology and delivering value for premium publishers and leading brands at scale. These strengths are fundamental to building a world class company that is helping to drive transformative shifts in the advertising landscape,' said Mark Zagorski. 'I am honored and excited to join the company and help further its leadership position. Tremor Video has done a fantastic job growing its business and highlighting the value of video advertising, and I look forward to working with the Board and the executive team to continue to execute on that vision.'
