Choo Chiang Holdings is offering 33.28 million vendor shares, of which 1 million are for public offer
Annabeth Leowleowhma@sph.com.sg

A local electrical product retailer and distributor launched its initial public offering (IPO) yesterday.
Choo Chiang Holdings was set up by Mr Thomas Lim in 1977 under the name Choo Chiang Electrical Trading Service. It has come a long way since his initial investment of $12,000. Last year, Choo Chiang raked in $70.4 million in revenue, with a net profit of $6 million.
The group is offering 33.28 million vendor shares, of which one million are for public offer.





The shares, to be listed on Catalist, are priced at 35 cents each, with a price-earnings ratio of 12.41 times based on earnings per share of 2.82 cents for the financial year ended December.
The management said it intends to pay out dividends of at least 30 per cent of net profit this year and next year.
Choo Chiang sells electrical products such as cables, switches, air-conditioner accessories and fans for industrial and residential use.





These products comprise third-party imported goods and Choo Chiang's proprietary CCM and CRM brands.
Mr Lim said in Mandarin that the listing "will take it up a level for our overseas suppliers to recognise us".
Financial controller Morland Fu said slow market conditions are no dampener on the decision to list. He believes that even without new construction projects, Choo Chiang will still see demand for its products coming from maintenance and renovation works.
The group is also confident of growth prospects in local public-sector construction demand.
Choo Chiang has nine retail branches here, with plans to open at least one more this year. It is also considering venturing into overseas markets, although Mr Fu said "we haven't decided which countries we are going into".
Choo Chiang expects to raise about $10.65 million in net proceeds.
All of the proceeds will go to Lim Trust, which is wholly owned by Mr Lim and his brother and co-founder, Rocky, and to third-party investment holding company Rhodus Capital, which is based in the British Virgin Islands.
The public offer closes at noon on July 27, and trading is expected to start two days later.

About Choo Chiang Holdings Ltd. 
Starting out as a trader and retailer of electrical products, appliances and accessories in 1977, Choo Chiang is today one of Singapore’s largest and leading suppliers and retailers of electrical products and accessories with a local retail presence of more than 20 years. It has two business segments, namely distribution business and property investment, with the former being the Group’s primary revenue generator.
The Group carries numerous brands of third party electrical products and accessories which are sourced from manufacturers based in France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and/or its Singapore-based distributors. They include notable brands such as Hager, Legrand, Schneider, MK, Philips, KDK and Bosch. In addition, the Group engages third party contract manufacturers based in the People’s Republic of China, Malaysia, Singapore and India to manufacture its proprietary range of “CCM” and “CRM” brand products based on its specifications and/or on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis.
Choo Chiang has eight product categories, including electrical cables and cable accessories; light switches, circuit breakers and accessories; lightning accessories; trunking and pipes; air-conditioner accessories; light fixtures and accessories; ventilating, wall-mounted and ceiling fans; and power drills and handheld tools.
With nine retail branches strategically located across different parts of Singapore, a fleet of approximately 20 delivery trucks and vans, and its extensive and well-stocked range of electrical products and accessories, Choo Chiang is able to quickly and efficiently deliver its products to its wide customer base that comprises electrical contractors, interior designers and walk-in customers. Over the last 20 years, the Group has forged strong and long-term relationships with its suppliers, which it believes enables it to keep abreast of the latest industry developments and have access to a broad range of products at competitive prices.
As a testament of its commitment to quality, Choo Chiang has bagged numerous awards and certifications over the years, including being named Legrand’s Top Customer of the Year for eleven consecutive years since 2004 and Singapore SME 500 Company by DP Information Group in 2006 to 2008. The Group also received the bizSAFE Level 3 certificate in 2012 and ISO 9001:2008 (Quality Management System Standards) certificate.
Choo Chiang currently owns 13 investment properties, the majority of which are rented out to third parties and from which the Group derives rental income. These properties have a net book value of approximately S$15.25 million as at 31 December 2014 and a market value of approximately S$20.05 million as at 30 April 2015(2). Revenue from this business segment accounted for less than 1% of the Group’s total revenue in each of FY2012, FY2013 and FY2014.
Executive Chairman and CEO, Mr Thomas Lim (林德全) commented, “With our established 20-year track record in this business, Choo Chiang has become one of the largest and leading providers of electrical products and accessories in Singapore. We are recognised for providing an efficient one-stop service which enables us to cater to the needs of our wide customer base thanks largely to our strong relationships with our suppliers, extensive range of electrical products and accessories and nine strategically located retail stores throughout the island. We believe these competitive strengths, together with our experienced management team, holds us in good stead as we take our business to the next level of growth.” 
Choo Chiang is spearheaded by Mr Thomas Lim and our Executive Director, Mr Rocky Lim (林德成), who each have over 40 years of experience in the industry and are supported by a team of experienced executive officers.
Prospects, Business Strategies and Future Plans 
As its products are widely and mainly used in industrial and residential settings, the Group’s business prospects and demand for its products are primarily driven by the general economic conditions and activities in the construction and property markets in Singapore. According to authorities, Singapore’s economic growth forecast for 2015 is maintained at 2.0% to 4.0%(3) while the public construction demand is anticipated to be stable with the aggregate value of construction contracts expected to reach between S$29.0 billion to S$36.0 billion in 2015, given a sustainable pipeline of public sector projects(4).
The Group plans to reinforce and strengthen its market position in Singapore, widen its product range and expand its operations into overseas markets through the setting up of retail branches, acquisitions, joint ventures and/or strategic collaborations with parties in other countries, subject to economic and market conditions.
Mr Thomas Lim further elaborated, “We plan to leverage on our market position to increase our market share in Singapore and, subject to the availability of good locations and other relevant business considerations, it is our current intention to open new retail branch(es) in Singapore in FY2015. At the same time, we plan to widen our proprietary range of “CCM” and “CRM” brand products.”
Financial Highlights 
The Group recorded revenues of S$70.95 million, S$74.96 million and S$70.44 million in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 respectively. In a bid to maintain its competitiveness and to attract new customers, the Group adopted a competitive pricing strategy in FY2014 which resulted in a 6.0% dip in revenue compared to FY2013. Net profit attributable to the Group’s shareholders for FY2014 stood at S$6.02 million.
Use of Proceeds 
The net proceeds raised of approximately S$10.65 million will be paid to the Vendors, Lim Trust Pte. Ltd. (“Lim Trust”) and Rhodus Capital Limited (“Rhodus”), in the proportion of the number of Invitation Shares offered by each of them. Mr Thomas Lim and Mr Rocky Lim hold a 90% and 10% interest in Lim Trust respectively while Rhodus is an investment holding company.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.
