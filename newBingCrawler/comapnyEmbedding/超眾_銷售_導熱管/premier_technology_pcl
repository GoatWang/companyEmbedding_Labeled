PCL Conversion Software & Development 
Since 1993, Page Technology Marketing, Inc. (PageTech) has specialized
exclusively in HP® PCL® print-stream
transformation, Intellifont® and TrueType™ Typeface
font utilities and other related PCL technologies.
Because so many OEMs have
used PageTech's technology in their PCL conversion and Universal
Printer Driver solutions, there are 120,000 + organizations and over 50 million
people using our technology worldwide.

PCL Product Benefits
Developers use our core technologies to leverage existing software and resources
to develop custom applications that meet and exceed their project requirements
yet stay within budget.
Raster
Object Extraction - We can extract each cancelled
check images, along with the statement text from ITI Premier® Director,
AFS Image Vision or other mainframe applications for migration as input to any
third party output management or mail optimization tool set. 
 With the PCL print stream text and raster resources you can update the presentation
of your statement with logos, color or just a better looking layout. And, you
can achieve an immediate ROI from the mail discounts, ability to print to any
printer and by routing through your folding or inserter equipment.
PCL
File Pre-Process Optimization - We can optimize large PCL print files
by eliminating all the fonts that are downloaded over and over again throughout
the print stream. We can even eliminate the download bitmap or scalable characters
downloaded in temporary fonts from Windows printer drivers.
The process is fast.  We can intercept the PCL on-the-fly and optimize it
before it prints or it’s transformed by any product.  Not only is the file size
reduced, but more importantly – the optimized file prints or transforms much
faster.

Text Extraction - We, alone, can extract text from
themost complex PCL files. We normally need to be consulted to select the
best text extraction method depending on the nature of the PCL.

Rapid Custom Application Development - With just 3-4 hrs.
of programming, the SDK's PCLXForm (Console Program with powerful script programing language) can decollate, add logos, auto-index and convert your
high volume print streams for archiving into any third-party document imaging
system.
Fast Technical Support - We rarely take more
than 24 hrs. to analyze and solve PCL application
issues.

Smallest PDF File Size - We create the smallest, text-searchable PDFs with
our exclusive JBIG2 to raster compression option. We can convert download
bitmap fonts into scalable TrueType fonts for embedding into PDFs when
converting to vector PDFs.Link: Why PDF/A

Office Supplies Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The office supply industry comprises revenues brought about by the retailing of office supplies in stores that primarily operate in selling these products. Items in the office supply market include paper, pencils and pens, business forms, stationery, storage containers and other forms of office equipment. Also included in this market are wholesalers offering paper, stationery, and office supplies for purchase. 
	 The predominant products in the office supply industry are office paper, labels, greeting cards, and general office supplies; combined, these items account for over half of the overall revenue for the market. Large retailers of office supplies purchase their stock specifically from manufacturers.
Wholesalers that concentrate in office stationery focus on distribution of a broad spectrum of paper products as well as basic office supplies. They market their products to other wholesalers in the industry, foreign buyers, and to the consumer.

There are an increasing number of small office supply businesses, and as such wholesalers are able to offer economic bundles of needed office equipment. However, as the concept of green businesses continues to grow, many offices are going paperless, which will impact the demand in this industry.

The degree of business activity drives the demand for the office supply industry. Competition in this market is steep due to online retailers, warehouse clubs, and supercenters. Larger companies have the ability to provide a wide range of products to the same consumer. Smaller businesses make providing specialty products and excellent customer service their priorities. Individual companies focus on devising superior merchandising tactics, as well an effective delivery system in order to generate profit.
