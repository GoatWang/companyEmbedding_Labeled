About Us






 




Paragon Technologies distributes quality bicycle parts throughout Southern Africa. We were established in 2001 when we imported our first product line – Thomson stems and seatposts from the USA.
We added to this by importing products from Taiwan and the USA that were not available in South Africa. The business has now grown into one of SA’s leading bicycle parts distributors. We now EXCLUSIVELY distribute a number of quality brands and sell many more bicycle related products.

OUR BRANDS
Absolute Black, Aerozine Titanium, Arundel Bicycle Company, The Barfly, Bike Yoke, Bold Cycles, Chris King, cn SPOKE, Feedback Sports, GSG Bike Wear, Handup Gloves, Juice Lubes, KCNC, Pilo, Quaxar, RedMonkey Sports, ROTOR, THOMSON, Veyga

If you are a manufacturer looking for someone to distribute your products in SA or you are not happy with your existing distributor please contact us.

Paragon Rapid Technologies
At Paragon we help you bring your products to the market.
Working with your design and development teams, we can offer support throughout the product development process. From providing initial models for design sign off, prototypes to check fit and function or for research, right through to low volume manufacture of the final product, we can help you ensure that you launch the best version possible of your product. Post launch we can provide accurate scale or cutaway models for Marketing and exhibitions too.
Expertise across industries
We work with a wide range of companies with one thing in common – that they strive to produce the best products in their particular markets.
On any given day you might find us working with a Formula One team to produce parts for that week’s race as well as producing fillable bottle prototypes for a shampoo manufacturer and a model of a subsea submersible for an exhibition. And that’s just a small selection of what we do.
At Paragon, our focus is on using rapid prototyping processes to provide both prototype and low volume production solutions to our growing customer base. Our technical expertise is supported by continual investment in new technologies and machinery to ensure Paragon remains an industry leader. The recent opening of a second site dedicated to CNC machining is indicative of the company’s year-on-year growth.

why choose us?For over 25 years, Paragon has led the way in the high-tech repair industry.DISCOVER OUR HISTORY
welcome to Paragon.


Like the city of Detroit in which our company was born, Paragon Technologies was built upon the principles of hard work and pride.
We started servicing repair to customers over 25 years ago in Detroit, then growing quickly throughout the Midwest. In our humble beginnings, Paragon Technologies was one technician and one truck.
Since then, we have grown into a thriving business with several facilities around the world…
And yet, we haven’t changed our core values that we started with.
Quality. Consistency. Respect. 
This “philosophy of excellence” carries through our entire organization. We consider every single one of our employees a part of our own family.
We are proud of the lifelong relationships we have built with nearly all of our customers. Some of the most respected companies in the world rely on Paragon, and you’ll soon understand why.
Welcome to Paragon Technologies.
