AC Servomotor/Driver/Controller･DC Servomotor･Smartmotor･Network Servo System"SV-NET".
We respond to wide range of needs with different variations.



TBL-iⅡSeries
High ability series.
Servo motors of this series have a high precision resolver built-in.
Their broad line-up　also makes models equipped with a reduction gear or brake available.
Applications include: multiaxial robots, physical distribution equipment, food processing/packaging equipment, training equipment, medical/health care equipment and measuring instruments, among others.
Servo motors of this series are ideal for easy positioning, as well as speed control for systems that are subject to signiﬁcant changes in load torque.

【TBL-iⅡ Series】 Compact size AC Servomotor (Flange size □40-80mm)
【TBL-iⅡ Series】 Large size AC Servomotor(Flange size □100ｰ□220）



NEW!!  TBL-iⅣ Series
High ability and low cogging.
New servo motor with previous high ability and smaller size.
High resolution serial optcal encoder(23bit).
Furthermore, for large size types (Flange size: 100 to 180mm), an encoder part has become detachable, and thus the maintainability of the motors has been enhanced.

【TBL-iⅣ Series】 Compact size AC Servomotor (Flange size □40-80mm)
【TBL-iⅣ Series】 Large size AC Servomotor (Flange size □100-180mm)



TBL-V Series
Servo motors of this series can replace step motors, contributing to high-speed system operation.

【TBL-V Series】 Compact size ･ High reliability AC Servomotor



TBL-i mini Series
The smallest size in the industry.
A miniature AC servo motor, has been added to our lineup-making possible via densification the size reduction of products such as semiconductor fabrication equipment, chip mounters, and small XY tables.
In order to integrate with a variety of sensors, this AC servo motor is available as either an encoder or resolver.

【TBL-i mini Series】 Miniature AC Servomotors/Drivers



SV-NET Servo System
Our SV-NET servo system demonstrates simple yet highly functional motion control, made possible by its superb configuration that comprises the controller (I/O unit provided as standard), the driver featuring a superior network commanding capability, and a diverse line-up of motor variations.
As such, SV-NET achieves total cost savings for customers who use medium and smaller systems by guaranteeing their system’s optimal performance
capability and best possible functions.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
