      Mycronic AB (publ), interim report January-September 2016
    



      Nine months of strong order intake - execution of strategy for growthMycronic 
      demonstrated a strong financial performance during the first nine months 
      of the year. Order intake and net sales increased 44 and 9 percent 
      respectively. The operating margin reached 22 percent. Demand for the 
      Group’s products is favorable, thanks to product launches which 
      broadened the Group’s addressable market. Mycronic also has major focus 
      on investments for future growth, both through initiatives in product 
      development and through acquisitions.
    





October 20, 2016 02:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:
    

      Third quarter July-September 2016
    


        Order intake was SEK 367 (559) million
      

        Net sales were SEK 497 (605) million
      

        EBIT was SEK 148 (262) million
      

        Earnings per share was SEK 1.17 (2.33)
      


      Period January-September 2016
    


        Order intake reached SEK 1,936 (1,341) million
      

        Net sales reached SEK 1,303 (1,194) million
      

        EBIT was SEK 286 (289) million 
      

        Earnings per share was SEK 2.25 (2.52)
      


      OutlookThe Board’s assessment remains, that net sales in 2016 will 
      be at the level of SEK 1,900 million, excluding effects from 
      acquisitions.
    

      CEO commentsThe first nine months demonstrated good demand for 
      Mycronic’s production solutions. Order intake increased 44 percent 
      compared with the same period 2015 and net sales increased 9 percent. We 
      are making significant investments in product development to maintain 
      our competitive edge. And we report an EBIT of SEK 286 million, or a 
      margin of 22 percent, for the first nine months. The order backlog 
      reached SEK 1,699 million.
    

      The global market for SMT equipment experienced a negative trend in 
      2015, while Mycronic maintained volumes and margins. In 2016, the 
      slowdown has affected business area SMT, primarily during the first half 
      year. The trend in the third quarter was positive with an increase in 
      the order intake and net sales com-pared with the third quarter 2015.
    

      Mycronic has received orders for nine mask writers thus far in 2016. The 
      newly launched the Prexision-800, which ensures effective production of 
      the most complex photomasks for the smart 4K phones and advanced AMOLED 
      displays of the future. The replacement offering provides customers with 
      a solution to secure long-term high productivity in photomask 
      manufacturing.
    

      Investments in product development within SMT equipment continue, in 
      line with the strategy. We have launched new products and in this way 
      broadened our product offering, which creates opportunities for growth. 
      The introduction of an updated MY600 for dispensing of several different 
      mounting fluids targets new segments on the SMT market, both from 
      geographic and product perspectives. The introduction has been well 
      received on the market.
    

      To achieve long-term, sustainable growth Mycronic’s strategy includes 
      M&As. During 2016, we acquired the German company RoyoTech, which 
      developed the strategic storage solutions that are an integrated part of 
      Mycronic’s offering for the smart factory. In August, an agreement was 
      signed on the acquisition of Axxon, a leading actor on the dispensing 
      market in China. The acquisition is strategically important as Axxon’s 
      technology and market position complement our own position, which make 
      us a leading global actor.
    

      Mycronic is continuing to execute the growth strategy at a high pace, 
      while at the same time delivering good results.

      · Earnings per share were SEK 2.52 (0.34)
    

      Outlook
    

      The Board’s assessment remains that sales in 2015 will be in the span 
      SEK 1,650-1,750 million.
    

      Strong performance throughout the Group
    

      “Healthy growth characterized the third quarter and the year’s first 
      nine months as regards sales and gross margins within both business 
      areas. Adjusted for currency effects, sales growth was 30 percent. The 
      delivery of an advanced display mask writer contributed significantly to 
      the operating profit. The order backlog remained strong after this mask 
      writer delivery and was SEK 849 million at the end of the quarter, 
      exceeding last year by more than SEK 100 million. Another advanced mask 
      writer will be delivered during the fourth quarter," says Lena Olving, 
      CEO and President of Mycronic AB.
    

      Mycronic’s launches of production solutions for effective electronics 
      production has led to increased demand within both of Mycronic’s 
      business areas, strengthening the company's market and financial 
      positions. In nine months, Mycronic has received orders for a total of 
      seven mask writers for different applications. The company's replacement 
      offering for customers with older mask writers for display applications 
      has been well received with three orders thus far this year.
    

      Mycronic's investments in product development within existing product 
      areas are now complemented with efforts supporting major technological 
      leaps within SMT. By widening the product offering to include other 
      segments, opportunities are created for a position shift, which is in 
      line with the company's strategy for growth.
    

      "Besides maintaining and developing our existing offering, we are 
      investing in product development for new needs and new markets within 
      SMT. This includes both new geographic markets and new product segments. 
      We will ensure the development of an attractive product offering which 
      corresponds to customers' high demands for effective electronics 
      production within segments where we have not traditionally been active. 
      To this end, we entered into a partnership with a high-tech engineering 
      company in Asia during the third quarter, increasing the pace in the 
      execution of our product development strategy within SMT. Through this 
      partnership, we complement our unique competence with specific 
      technology and market competence for new customer requirements," says 
      Lena Olving.
    

      Mycronic’s assessment is that costs for these efforts will be high for a 
      number of years to come. It is beneficial to do this now while the Group 
      is experiencing both strong sales and a good profit. These opportunities 
      for unique activities clearly confirm the logic behind the Mycronic 
      merger of two companies in 2009, both of which are active within 
      different areas of the electronics industry.

Mycronic to exhibit new expanded product range at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg
 




2017-05-15 09:05 

Täby, May 15, 2017 – Mycronic AB (publ) will demonstrate a wide array of new assembly solutions for the intelligent factory at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany, May 16-18, 2017. Products on display will include the new MY300 pick-and-place solution, the new MY700 high-speed jet dispenser for jet printing of solder paste and dispensing of assembly fluids, and a range of new dispensing and conformal coating equipment.
Introducing the new next-generation MYPro seriesTo help manufacturers boost productivity amid a growing mix of products, assembly fluid applications and complex miniaturized components, Mycronic is introducing its next-generation MYPro series product lineup. The latest release is the compact new MY300 pick-and-place solution, which promises higher real speeds and expanded feeder capacity within a 40 percent smaller machine footprint than previous generations. This follows on the recent launch of the innovative MY700 jet printer and dispenser, which jets both solder paste and a wide range of adhesive and assembly fluids at the industry’s highest speeds.
MY300 – Higher productivity within a 40 percent smaller footprintThe new MY300 expands capacity up to 224 feeder positions within a 40 percent smaller footprint than previous models. At the same time, it also achieves higher real speeds due to a number of performance enhancements including automatic job selection and rolling changeover, as well as faster board transfer and tool changes. Fully automated board train functionality is now standard on MY300DX and SX models, which significantly increases throughput thanks to simultaneous assembly of multiple boards. Additionally, the series’ improved linescan vision system, with up to 4k resolution, ensures a future-proof solution for even the most advanced fine-pitch components. The MY300 will be available in three different models: the MY300DX, MY300SX and MY300LX, offering a wide selection of highly automated line configurations for any intelligent factory. MY700 – Solder paste and adhesive jetting with twice the possibilitiesThe MY700 combines a new dual-lane, dual-head design with high-speed, state-of-the-art jetting heads. The dual-head design covers the widest possible range of solder paste dot volumes for small and very large components, or can be configured to jet two different types of media. The dual-lane capability ensures a non-stop flow of multiple boards with no operator intervention. With just one fully software-driven machine, the MY700 makes it possible to cover a wide variety of challenging process steps with no need for screen printers or general dispensers, all within just one-and-a-half square meters of floor space. The MY700 will be available in three different models: the MY700JX, MY700JP and MY700JD.
New portfolio of dispensing and conformal coating equipmentWith last year’s acquisition of Axxon, one of China’s leading producers of dispensing and coating equipment for the electronics industry, Mycronic has significantly expanded its dispensing capabilities. At SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremburg, Mycronic will exhibit several products from this portfolio, including a number of compact and versatile tabletop dispensing systems as well as flexible conformal coating systems for a range of applications.
Visit Booth 4-349 at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany To view the new MYPro series, dispensing and conformal coating equipment, and to explore the advantages of the complete Mycronic 4.0 intelligent factory, visit Booth 4-349 at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany, May 16-18, 2017.

        Täby, May 15, 2017 - Mycronic AB (publ) will demonstrate a wide array of new assembly solutions for the intelligent factory at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany, May 16-18, 2017. Products on display will include the new MY300 pick-and-place solution, the new MY700 high-speed jet dispenser for jet printing of solder paste and dispensing of assembly fluids, and a range of new dispensing and conformal coating equipment.
      

Introducing the new next-generation MYPro seriesTo help manufacturers boost productivity amid a growing mix of products, assembly fluid applications and complex miniaturized components, Mycronic is introducing its next-generation MYPro series product lineup. The latest release is the compact new MY300 pick-and-place solution, which promises higher real speeds and expanded feeder capacity within a 40 percent smaller machine footprint than previous generations. This follows on the recent launch of the innovative MY700 jet printer and dispenser, which jets both solder paste and a wide range of adhesive and assembly fluids at the industry's highest speeds.
      

MY300 - Higher productivity within a 40 percent smaller footprintThe new MY300 expands capacity up to 224 feeder positions within a 40 percent smaller footprint than previous models. At the same time, it also achieves higher real speeds due to a number of performance enhancements including automatic job selection and rolling changeover, as well as faster board transfer and tool changes. Fully automated board train functionality is now standard on MY300DX and SX models, which significantly increases throughput thanks to simultaneous assembly of multiple boards. Additionally, the series' improved linescan vision system, with up to 4k resolution, ensures a future-proof solution for even the most advanced fine-pitch components.
      

        The MY300 will be available in three different models: the MY300DX, MY300SX and MY300LX, offering a wide selection of highly automated line configurations for any intelligent factory.
      

MY700 - Solder paste and adhesive jetting with twice the possibilitiesThe MY700 combines a new dual-lane, dual-head design with high-speed, state-of-the-art jetting heads. The dual-head design covers the widest possible range of solder paste dot volumes for small and very large components, or can be configured to jet two different types of media. The dual-lane capability ensures a non-stop flow of multiple boards with no operator intervention. With just one fully software-driven machine, the MY700 makes it possible to cover a wide variety of challenging process steps with no need for screen printers or general dispensers, all within just one-and-a-half square meters of floor space.
      

        The MY700 will be available in three different models: the MY700JX, MY700JP and MY700JD.
      

New portfolio of dispensing and conformal coating equipmentWith last year's acquisition of Axxon, one of China's leading producers of dispensing and coating equipment for the electronics industry, Mycronic has significantly expanded its dispensing capabilities.
      

        At SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremburg, Mycronic will exhibit several products from this portfolio, including a number of compact and versatile tabletop dispensing systems as well as flexible conformal coating systems for a range of applications.

Visit Booth 4-349 at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany To view the new MYPro series, dispensing and conformal coating equipment, and to explore the advantages of the complete Mycronic 4.0 intelligent factory, visit Booth 4-349 at SMT Hybrid Packaging in Nuremberg, Germany, May 16-18, 2017.

Order intake increased 44 percent compared with the same period 2015 and net sales increased 9 percent. We are making significant investments in product development to maintain our competitive edge. And we report an EBIT of SEK 286 million, or a margin of 22 percent, for the first nine months. The order backlog reached SEK 1,699 million.The global market for SMT equipment experienced a negative trend in 2015, while Mycronic maintained volumes and margins. In 2016, the slowdown has affected business area SMT, primarily during the first half year. The trend in the third quarter was positive with an increase in the order intake and net sales com-pared with the third quarter 2015.Mycronic has received orders for nine mask writers thus far in 2016. The newly launched the Prexision-800, which ensures effective production of the most complex photomasks for the smart 4K phones and advanced AMOLED displays of the future. The replacement offering provides customers with a solution to secure long-term high productivity in photomask manufacturing.Investments in product development within SMT equipment continue, in line with the strategy. We have launched new products and in this way broadened our product offering, which creates opportunities for growth. The introduction of an updated MY600 for dispensing of several different mounting fluids targets new segments on the SMT market, both from geographic and product perspectives. The introduction has been well received on the market.To achieve long-term, sustainable growth Mycronic’s strategy includes M&As. During 2016, we acquired the German company RoyoTech, which developed the strategic storage solutions that are an integrated part of Mycronic’s offering for the smart factory. In August, an agreement was signed on the acquisition of Axxon, a leading actor on the dispensing market in China. The acquisition is strategically important as Axxon’s technology and market position complement our own position, which make us a leading global actor.Mycronic is continuing to execute the growth strategy at a high pace, while at the same time delivering good results.Lena Olving, CEO and PresidentAbout Mycronic Mycronic AB is a high-tech Swedish company engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing of production solutions to the electronics industry.
