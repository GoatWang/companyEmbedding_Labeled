						Company Summary

Headquartered in Singapore, our core business is in Information Technology distribution, and we have been in this business since 1989. We carry a range of premium IT brands such as Adaptec, AOpen, eDevices, ECS, EIZO, Emulex, Panasonic, Prestigio, Prezmate and Samsung. We also consistently strive to provide additional value-added services to our many resellers/customers whom we work very closely with. Most of our products complement each other perfectly; therefore, we do not just 'sell boxes' but concentrate on helping our resellers customize & provide complete solutions. We gain customers' loyalty with our technical expertise, our wide range of complementary products, and our outstanding before/after sales service and support. In this way, as our customers' businesses grow, we also grow with them.
