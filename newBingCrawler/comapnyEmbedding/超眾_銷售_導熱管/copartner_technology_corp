			The trend of extended applications in semiconductor power MOSFETs is moving to the increasing requirement for small form factor and higher power efficiency. The driving of smaller Rds(on) for power MOSFETs to reduce power consumption becomes a challenge and vital for the development of power semiconductor devices. Therefore the continual push for lower substrate resistivity has also been highly focused in the crystal growth technology development in Wafer Works.

			 

			Other than resistivity the control of oxygen content in silicon is another key index in silicon-growth technology, which also plays a crucial role on the device performance. Wafer Works has developed MCZ technology that allows us to precisely control the oxygen content to meet the demand of high-end device market.



	 


		The shrink of device pitch follows Moor’s Law. As the device density increases, the demand for higher substrate quality, better wafer site flatness and higher purity wafer surface, is also increasing with time. Wafer Works endeavors to improve wafer product quality as well as crystal growth technology, and the key factors involved in the wafering technology development are listed in the following:.


	Technology of Wafer Stress Control


		The warp represents the distribution of stress on the wafer. Its variation is well contained within 10um (Cpk> 1.33) in Wafer Works through proper control of the run times of wire guide, the control of slurry quality and other slicing process parameters to meet the stress requirement in subsequent wafering processes.



		Technology for Shape of Edge Profiling and Roughness Control

		Wafer Works has extensive experience on wafer edge grinding. Various design selections of edge profiles are available to meet different customer’s demands. Also, we co-work with customers to develop special edge profiles. Besides, Wafer Works has developed helical process, a solution for special and strict specification of edge condition, and can greatly improve both the edge profile and edge roughness.

		Extrinsic Gettering Technology

		Wafer Works is capable of depositing single (or multiple) poly crystalline thin film layers on silicon wafer to enhance extrinsic gettering capability of Si wafer and adjust wafer warps.

		Polishing Technology

		The technology of wafer polishing has always been improving in Wafer Works to satisfy the arising demand from customers for superior quality of wafer surfaces. The unrelenting demand of improved TTV and STIR, which is becoming more critical on the products of deep sub-micron generation, is accomplished through the advancement of polishing technology and the introduction of new polishing equipment in Wafer Works.


	 

	Wafer Works Epitaxial Corporation, a subsidiary in Shanghai, China, is established to provide epi layers and making a complete Si substrate product portfolio in Wafer Works, and providing one-stop shopping opportunity for our customers.

	 

	The experience Wafer Works has accumulated over the past years on the substrate technology development and manufacturing enables it to optimize substrate products to be suitable for the development of epitaxial process, for either single layer or multi-layer products. The multi-layer epitaxial technology makes it possible in offering diversified silicon wafers, which realize device designs for specific product applications.

About Chaintech Graphics Card
Distributors and Marketing


        Our alliance with Colorful is limited to market development only. At the channel level, Chaintech is
trying to consolidate the mainboard and graphics card markets while pushing for
greater differentiation between NVIDIA
and AMD graphics card products.
This move is intended to maximize market share and identify partnership opportunities. Both online and traditional channels are now being
used. 


        The online distribution channel
includes online distributors and e-commerce platforms. Online
distribution mainly consists of C2C+B2C sales through
Taobao. Taobao.com's total transaction
value exceeded 1 Trillion RMB in 2012, while graphics card sales in 2012 also increased by an average of 40%.
JD.COM generated transactions of more than 70 Billion RMB in 2012 with graphics card sales increasing at
the same rate as
Taobao.com, demonstrating the
increasing importance of e-commerce in China. Chaintech has leveraged Colorful to set up
an online sales framework with reasonable
controls put into place to avoid any conflicts between the online and traditional channels. 


        Traditional channels have been affected by e-commerce but only to a limited extent.
We have now worked with Colorful to set up more
than 300 core channel stores in major cities throughout China. By adjusting
the relationship between online and offline channels, we have identified and
taken advantage of the best features of both to maximize our market share. In 2012, Chaintech and our sales partner
saw our sales in traditional channels grow by 30%. 

        With regards to marketing, we are continuing to work closely with the local and foreign media and have won more
than 1000 media awards. Advertisements
aimed at large computer retailers, road shows, campus events, product training courses and overclocking
competitions have generated massive
user participation. New marketing tools
such as Weibo, WeChat and online
multimedia are also being used for user interaction as part of our efforts to
establish a first-class brand and boost brand value.

Made of purest OFC,the conductor has the characteristics of high
conductivity, low electric resistance, good signal transmission and
low loss. Solid FEP with 75ohm characteristic impedance as the
insulation, distortion arising from unmatched impedance can be
prevented, ensures image quality and transmits image signal with
high stability and fidelity. Double shielded,aluminum foil + OFC
braiding (spiral), minimal circuit interference, high
signal-to-noise ratio is obtained. Soft, highly flexible PVC outer
jacket has an elegant look and also can protect the cable for
durability.
