KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 13): Penang-based precision engineering parts fabricator and supplier FoundPac Group Bhd, which is en route to being listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Market on Dec 29, has priced its initial public offering (IPO) shares at 54 sen apiece to raise up to RM21.6 million.In its IPO prospectus released today, it said it will be issuing 40 million new shares, of which 18.5 million will be made available to the Malaysian public, and 10.5 million to its eligible directors, employees and business associates, with the remaining 11 million to be placed out to identified investors.In addition, its major shareholder FoundPac Holdings Sdn Bhd is offering 92 million shares up for sale, by way of private placement — 55 million will be placed to identified investors, with the remaining 37 million to selected Bumiputera investors.In a statement, FoundPac chief executive Lee Chun Wah said proceeds from the group's listing will help drive the next phase of the group's growth, and strengthen its business as a whole.Of the RM21.6 million to be raised, RM8 million will be used for the purchase of property, plants as well as equipment, RM3.6 million will be reserved for working capital, RM3 million for design and development efforts, and RM4 million to fund the group's overseas expansion plans.FoundPac, which was established in 2005, expects to have a market capitalisation of approximately RM199.8 million upon listing based on the IPO price of 54 sen."While locally based, the group's products are exported for the most part to various international markets primarily in Europe and the United States, with the US market constituting almost 73% of FoundPac's sales in FY2016," it said."In light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), I believe the time is right to take advantage of FoundPac's established track record, to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California in the US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices."Concurrently, we plan to strengthen our current capabilities through the setting up of a dedicated design and development team, which will be focused on product development. To further stabilise our revenue generation the group is also looking to diversify our customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry," Lee shared.TA Securities Holdings Bhd is the principal adviser, sole underwriter and placement agent for the IPO exercise.

PETALING JAYA: Engineering parts maker FoundPac Group Bhd, which launched its prospectus yesterday, aims to raise RM21.6 million from its initial public offering (IPO) involving 40 million new ordinary shares of 10 sen each at an issue price of 54 sen per share.
A sum of RM8 million will be used for the purchase of property, plants and equipment, while the balance, RM3.6 million will be used as working capital, RM3 million for design and development efforts and RM4 million will be to fund the group’s overseas expansion plans. 
FoundPac and its subsidiaries fabricate and supply precision engineering parts, namely stiffeners, test sockets, hand lids and related accessories that are sold to semiconductor manufacturers and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies or for printed circuit board design houses or fabless semiconductor companies which are used to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits.
Although it is locally based, its products are exported to various international markets primarily in Europe and the US, with the latter constituting almost 73% of its sales in FY2016.
“In light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, I believe the time is right to take advantage of FoundPac’s established track record, to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California, US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices,” FoundPac CEO Lee Chun Wah said in a statement.
He said it plans to strengthen its capabilities via the setting up of a dedicated design and development team focused on product development. The group also aims to diversify its customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry.
“The proceeds from a successful listing will help drive the next phase of the group’s growth, and strengthen our business as a whole. I am both excited and delighted therefore, to welcome potential investors to be a part of this new chapter in our corporate history as we pursue an active expansion blueprint,” Lee said.
The 40 million public issue shares comprise 18.5 million shares which will be offered to the public by way of balloting and which 50% will be set aside for bumiputra investors; 10.5 million shares for subscription by eligible directors, employees and business associates/persons who have contributed to the group and 11 million shares to be placed out to identified investors.
In addition, FoundPac’s major shareholder FoundPac Holdings Sdn Bhd will undertake an offer for sale of 92 million shares by way of placement of 55 million shares to identified investors as well as 37 million shares to bumiputra investors approved by the International Trade and Industry Ministry.
FoundPac is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM199.8 million upon listing on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia, based on the IPO price of 54 sen. The closing date of the IPO is Dec 19, 2016 and the tentative listing date is Dec 29, 2016. 
TA Securities Holdings Bhd is the principal adviser, sole underwriter and placement agent for the IPO exercise.

PETALING JAYA: FoundPac Group Bhd, en route to a listing on the Main Market on Dec 29, is expected to raise RM21.6mil which will mainly be used to purchase new machineries and finance its overseas expansion. Under the listing exercise, 40 million shares of 54 sen each will be made available, comprising 18.5 million new shares for the public, 10.5 million new shares for eligible directors, employees and business associates as well as 11 million new shares for application by way of private placement to identified investors.The existing shareholder of FoundPac will undertake an offer for sale of 92 million shares by way of placement of 55 million shares to identified investors and 37 million shares to bumiputra investors.FoundPac established its operations in 2005, and together with its subsidiary companies are principally involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of precision engineering parts namely stiffeners, test sockets, hand lids and related accessories. While locally based, the group’s products are exported for the most part to various international markets primarily in Europe and the US, with the US market constituting almost 73.0% of FoundPac’s sales in FYE2016. The group has worked with a number of well-known established electronic companies over the years, including Broadcom Corp, which is a US fabless semiconductor company.FoundPac chief executive officer Lee Chun Wah said this was a testament to the efforts of the team at FoundPac as well as its business partners, listing advisers and the regulatory authorities that the company has reached this point in its listing exercise. “It has been a long and challenging journey, so it is extremely satisfying to see all our hard work come to fruition. The proceeds from a successful listing will help drive the next phase of the group’s growth, and strengthen our business as a whole. I am both excited and delighted therefore, to welcome potential investors to be a part of this new chapter in our corporate history as we pursue an active expansion blueprint,” he said in a statement yesterday. Lee said that in light of the positive prospects for the growth of the semiconductor industry globally, thanks in part to the continued increase in adoption of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, he believed the time was right to take advantage of FoundPac’s established track record. “We want to steadily expand our market share in major markets including Milan, Italy and California in the US, where we have plans to set up new sales offices. Concurrently, we plan to strengthen our current capabilities through the setting up of a dedicated design and evelopment team which will be focused on product development. To further stabilise our revenue generation the Group is also looking to diversify our customer base to include end-user industries like those in the automotive industry,” said Lee. In its prospectus, FoundPac intends to allocate about RM8mil from the proceeds of the public issue to fund our acquisition of new equipment for its operationsIt also plans to allocate approximately RM4mil from the proceeds of the public issue to defray the cost to be incurred for setting-up our sales office in Milan and California in the next two years. Additionally, the group proposed to allocate RM3.6mil for working capital requirements.
