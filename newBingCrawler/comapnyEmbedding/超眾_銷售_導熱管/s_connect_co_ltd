Trend
The Challenge of IoT
From self-driving cars to factory robots, TE engineers are imagining new ways of connecting our world through IoT-enabled machines.




















Transforming Connectivity with Conductive Plastics
Conductive plastics provide a lighter, less expensive connectivity solution for next-generation electronics.
















The Future of the Electric Car is Here
From intelligent charging cables to high-voltage contactors, advances in electric vehicles are improving the path to autonomy. 













Trend
Smart-City Strategy
The decreasing cost of connectivity is enabling municipalities to integrate critical systems. To succeed, they need a clear vision for building a smart city.












Advanced connectivity can help you build more robust technological architectures. In data centers, our STRADA Whisper connectors transfer data at 25 Gigabits per second (Gbps), scalable to 56 Gbps. In factory machines, our ARISO Contactless Connectivity connects signal without disruption – and without a physical connection. In electric cars, our integrated sensor assemblies and transmission harnesses safely put more power into primary systems and subsystems. In commercial aircraft, our small, lightweight interconnects and high-density sensors enable higher bandwidths and speeds in critical systems. With connectors, sensors, and more from TE Connectivity (TE), you can build technology that helps make the world safer, sustainable, productive, and connected.











Application
Power Connectivity
TE provides innovative products for evolving vehicle architectures in order to protect power and serve signal needs.














Application
Server Solutions
Extend a server’s reach and reduce its power consumption, while increasing speed and density in any configuration – blade, rack mount, or sleds.














Application
Motor Connectivity
Motors today are increasingly compact, yet house more functions. Learn how TE enables motors to operate under highest possible demands.

New TE Product
Reflow Capable Connectors
Engineered for high-performance reflow soldering of PCB assemblies, our reflow capable universal MATE-N-LOK connectors and Economy Power headers are designed to withstand high temperatures associated with reflow soldering. These are used in appliances, HVAC equipment, security systems, industrial machinery, and elevators and escalators.






















New TE Product
0.5mm Fine Pitch Hermaphroditic Connectors
This type of board-to-board connector offers a hermaphroditic design that mates to itself, reducing inventory product mix with consolidated part numbers and components. There is only one part number for the header and receptacle, which saves time and cost associated with qualifying new parts.





















New TE Product
DEUTSCH Lightweight Bulkhead Feedthroughs
These high-power connectors offer a lightweight method of connecting electrical power through an equipment bulkhead. Based on MIL-DTL-38999 mounting footprints, these are up to 50 percent lighter than existing TE standard male terminal feedthroughs.

                            The !D Gate is a modern, open pedestal that is mounted on the floor. Because it is an integrated reader, both the reader and antennae are included. It supports processes like goods receiving, transition from stock room to sales floor and anti-theft (EAS). Depending on the role, the optimum RFID parameters are chosen automatically.

                            The !D POS is an integrated reader to be used for reading items at the point-of-sale station. It has a small, rugged casing that can be mounted under the cash desk. The antenna only reads items on top of the reader, while ignoring items below or next to the antenna, due to the built-in shielding. It can be connected via USB or Ethernet, while the power can be supplied by a local power supply.
