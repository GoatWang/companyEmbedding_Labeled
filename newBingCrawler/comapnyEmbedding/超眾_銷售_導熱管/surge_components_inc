					Full Description



Surge Components, Inc. (Surge), incorporated on June 11, 2010, is a supplier of electronic products and components. The Company's products include capacitors, which are electrical energy storage devices, and discrete components, such as semiconductor rectifiers, transistors and diodes, which are single function low power semiconductor products that are packaged alone as compared to integrated circuits, such as microprocessors. The products that the Company sells are utilized in the electronic circuitry of products, including automobiles, telecomm, audio, cellular telephones, computers, consumer electronics, garage door openers, household appliances, power supplies and security equipment. The products that the Company sells are sold to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and to distributors of the lines of products it sells.Surge supplies a range of electronic components, which can be divided into approximately two categories, including capacitors and discrete components. The Company sells, under the name of the manufacturer, Lelon Electronics, aluminum electrolytic capacitors, which are capacitors that store and release energy into a circuit incrementally and are used in various applications, including computers, appliances, automotive, lighting, telecommunications devices and various consumer products.CapacitorsThe product line of capacitors the Company sells include Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors, Ceramic Capacitors and Mylar Film Capacitors. Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors, which are Surge's principal product, are storage devices used in power applications to store and release energy as the electronic circuitry demands. They are used in power supplies. Ceramic Capacitors are used in the electronics industry. They are used to bypass or filter semiconductors in resonant circuits and are found in a range of products, including computer, telecom, appliances, games and toys. Mylar Film Capacitors are used for noise suppression and filtering. They are used in telecommunication and computer products.Discrete ComponentsThe Discrete components, such as semiconductor rectifiers, transistors and diodes, are packaged individually to perform a single or limited function, in contrast to integrated circuits, such as microprocessors and other chips, which contain from only a few diodes to as many as several million diodes and other elements in a single package, and are designed to perform complex tasks. The product line of discrete components the Company sells includes Rectifiers, Transistors, Diodes, Circuit Protection Devices and Audible Components. Low power semiconductor rectifiers are devices that convert alternating current (AC) power, into one directional current (DC) power, by permitting current to flow in one direction only. Transistors send a signal to the circuit for transmission of waves. They are used in applications involving the processing or amplification of electric current and electric signals, including data, television, sound and power. Diodes are two-lead or surface mount components that allow electric current to flow in only one direction. The Company's circuit protection devices include transient voltage suppressors and metal oxide varistors, which protect circuits against switching, lightning surges and other uncontrolled power surges and/or interruptions in circuits. Audible Components include audible transducers, Piezo buzzers, speakers, and microphones, which produce an audible sound for, and are used in back-up power supplies for computers, alarms, appliances, smoke detectors, automobiles, telephones and other products, which produce sounds. Its new products include fuses, printed circuit boards and switches. All products are available in traditional leaded, as well as surface mount (chip) versions.The Company competes with Nichicon, Panasonic, Illinois Capacitor, NIC, AVX, Murata, Epcos, United Chemicon, Rubycon, Vishay, Kemet, General Semiconductor Division, General Instrument Corp., OnSemi, Inc., Microsemi Corp., Diodes, Inc., Littlefuse, Copper Bussman Division, Projects Unlimited, International Components Corp. and Star Micronics.
