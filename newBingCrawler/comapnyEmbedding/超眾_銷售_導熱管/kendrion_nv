		        		Kendrion Kuhnke News:: Safety I/O expands Kendrion Kuhnke product portfolio


With the new safety input and output terminal, Kendrion Kuhnke Automation not only expands its product portfolio, but also enters a new league in the automation field. After gaining experience over almost 40 years and establishing itself as a major player in the field of electronic automation technology, the company finally presents its first product conforming to the strict requirements of functional safety. Safe functionality according to the Machinery Directive is a must-have in modern machine technology. For this reason, Kendrion Kuhnke Automation has joint with other medium-sized companies in Germany to take this vital step forward.  As a new product of the proven Kuhnke FIO series, which is well established on the market, the “yellow” I/O terminal is operating via the safe EtherCAT®-Protocol (FSOE) and can be integrated anywhere within this modular I/O system. The new Safety EtherCAT terminal Kuhnke FIO Safety I/O 4DI/2DO is a digital input and output module with four safe input channels and two safe output channels. The digital inputs connect to sensors with floating terminals. The failure-resistant outputs switch 24 V DC actors with a current of up to 2 A per channel. If the EtherCAT terminal detects a failure, it switches off automatically (fail stop). The FIO Safety I/O 4DI/2DO conforms to the requirements of IEC 61508 SIL 3 and DIN EN ISO 13849 PL e. Besides this new safety module 4DI/2DO, a safety PLC and additional safety I/O modules will be included into the product portfolio of Kendrion Kuhnke Automation. On request, these modules are also available as custom-designed solutions tailored to a specific machine.Malente, November 7th, 2013

Calculation
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the company. Fixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company's 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company's manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.



Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesn't need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesn't change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.
