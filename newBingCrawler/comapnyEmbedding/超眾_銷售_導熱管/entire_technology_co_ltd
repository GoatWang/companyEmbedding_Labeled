Company
			Since June 2003, ENTIRE TECHNOLOGY CO LTD has been the focal point 
			of domestic and international markets in industrial fields such as 
			optoelectronic materials, extrusion, and super precise process. 
			Entire is currently one of the top three global suppliers in 
			diffuser plates. 

			Our main products are diffuser plates applied in backlight module of 
			TFT-LCD, In Mold Decoration film used in consumer electronic goods, 
			and more upcoming products developed with our core technology and 
			excellent research ability once our pending patents are granted. We 
			intend to be an independent and distinguished components supplier, 
			helping the factories in Taiwan to reduce their reliance on imported 
			components. 

			Our diffuser plates are certified by foreign and domestic LCD panel 
			companies, as well as system module manufacturers. We have obtained 
			twenty-five total patents in Taiwan, Japan, USA, and Mainland China, 
			thus enabling Entire to become the first Taiwanese manufacturer with 
			the capability to mass-produce diffusion plates. 

			We are also devoted to high value added products of diffusion plates 
			with surface microstructure, which provides better brightness 
			enhancement and reduces the usage of brightness film and electrical 
			power, lowering the cost for LCD panel companies. Our products are 
			in steady production, supplying the needs of domestic and 
			international technological companies. 

			Entire has been one of the largest suppliers of diffusion plates in 
			Taiwan area. We are currently expanding our overseas market to 
			promote our best quality products worldwide. At the same time, we 
			are making good surplus and properly extending our business scale to 
			achieve outstanding success in the near future.

					Micro-structure light guide plate

					      ENTIRE manufacture 
					micro-structure light guide plate through extrusion process 
					which apply to edge type BLU. It can guide light of uneven 
					point light source into even plate light source. The optical 
					efficiency and uniformity is better than conventional light 
					guide plate. 

					Properties


 Great 
						optical performance: Higher uniformity and brightness 
						optical performance than conventional PMMA light guide 
						plate with printing.



						Excellent dimension stability: Lower water absorption 
						rate with better dimension stability withMS 
						micro-structure material compare to conventional PMMA 
						material LGP (Figure 1). 



						Thickness reduction: 2mm thickness Entire’s LGP can use 
						to replace conventional PMMA 3mm LGP.



						Customized design: Customized design for different needs.
