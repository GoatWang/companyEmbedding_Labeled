Company Product Overview
 ranging from clear lenses, progressive design lenses and polarized lenses to the most advanced sunwear on the market.


















NuPolar
The market leader in prescription
                        polarized sunwear  







  
 When light is reflected it can become polarized and form "blinding glare," visual noise that interferes with the real image. The results can be uncomfortable or even hazardous. Only polarized lenses block blinding glare, providing both visual comfort and safety.




















Transitions Drivewear
A new lens category designed
                        with drivers in mind







  
 Today our lives are influenced by the automobile, which has changed the way we experience the outdoors. We need a third category of lenses in our modern, automobile-centered world.




















Trilogy
The future
                        of eye care







  
 Trilogy® is the first lens to offer impact resistance plus ultra lightweight and thinness without compromising optical performance.
















 


















Image
Award-winning progressive design
                        with the widest range of options







  
 The award-winning IMAGE® progressive has been rated favorably in recent independent studies. IMAGE boasts one of the widest distortion free distance zones in the industry, and is available in the widest range of materials, treatments and colors available.




















Transitions
Advanced performance
                        for healthy sight







  
 Clearer, darker, faster to activate and faster to fade back, Transitions Signature lenses offer significant improvements over previous generations. Younger Optics has a complete line of Transitions Signature, Transitions XTRActive and Transitions Vantage lenses, including many specialty products found nowhere else.




















Specialty Products
A wide variety of specialty products 
                        found only at Younger Optics







  
 With over 50 years of lens innovation, Younger Optics continues to provide many unique specialty and occupational lenses.
















 


















Camber
Digital progressive lens
                        with complex curves on both surfaces







  
 By utilizing the power of complex curves on both surfaces of the lens, Camber seems to offer something for everyone. Better optics, cosmetics, improved near and widened distance zones – Camber is truly a breakthrough for the laboratory, eyecare professional, and most importantly, the patient.




















NuPolar Gradient
Encapsulated Gradient - won't fade
 or discolor







  
 Gradient lenses are highly desired by wearers; however, most do not offer the high-efficiency glare blocking power of polarization. NuPolar Gradient lenses offer a 98% polarization coefficient, which means blinding glare is blocked almost entirely.
