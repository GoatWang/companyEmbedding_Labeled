The Good Prints fast; nice expansion options; compatible with many operating systems.
The Bad Poor graphics print quality; mediocre text-print quality; no USB or parallel cable.
The Bottom Line The LaserJet 1300 offers fast prints and a lot of expansion options for a home office or a small business. Unfortunately, its print quality fails to measure up to the rest of its attributes.

 Review summaryThe $399 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 1300 has some big shoes to fill, replacing one of our favorite personal monochrome lasers, the LaserJet 1200. The LaserJet 1300 keeps the same look and feel, right down to its sloped-front design and front-loading paper tray. It also offers a number of options unavailable in the earlier model, such as wireless networkability and more memory. But somehow, the excellent print quality of the LaserJet 1200 got lost along the way--along with a lot of our enthusiasm for this otherwise promising personal laser printer. Setting up and installing the LaserJet 1300 is simple. The printer's box includes nearly everything you need: a toner cartridge, a power cord, a printed setup guide, and an installation CD. Unfortunately, like most vendors these days, HP does not include a USB or parallel-port cable. The printed guide offers step-by-step instructions, with easy-to-follow illustrations. The CD includes an expanded user guide that covers most installation problems. It also offers complete descriptions of LaserJet 1300's improvements over the LaserJet 1200 and of many extracost options.
The design of the printer itself is straightforward. Weighing 19 pounds, the LaserJet 1300 is on the heavy side, though its dimensions of 16.3 inches wide by 19.1 inches deep and 9.5 inches high are about right for those of a personal laser printer. Most of the LaserJet 1300's basic maintenance functions are easy to do. It's easy to install the toner cartridge and the paper tray, as both are located in front. The toner cartridge fits behind a removable panel above the opening where the main paper tray sits.

/sc/30101765-2-200-DT3.gif" width="200" height="150" border="0" />The toner cartridge and the paper tray are both easy to install from the front.
The standard paper handling is sufficient but a little hard to use. In addition to the main paper input tray, you get a manual-feed tray that's located on top of the main paper tray. However, removing the main paper tray with a little too much force can dislodge the manual-feed tray.
One common and annoying feature of lower-priced laser printers is the array of usually apocryphal status lights that try to tell you what the printer is doing. Unfortunately, the LaserJet 1300 shares this shortcoming. You'll need to refer to the electronic manual to decipher the signals; there are no markings on the printer itself that explain the status.
The LaserJet 1300 is compatible with most major operating systems. HP provides drivers for Windows 95 and later, Mac OS X and later, Novell NetWare, Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, IBM AIX and MPE-iX. CNET Labs tested the LaserJet 1300 with Windows XP Professional. There are a number of excellent SOHO features in the LaserJet 1300, such as a 133MHz Motorola Coldfire processor chip and 16MB of built-in RAM, expandable to 80MB. This amount of horsepower should readily handle the mostly small-scale print jobs of SOHO users. The printer wakes up quickly, and in our informal tests, the first finished page appeared in less than 10 seconds. The LaserJet 1300 printer includes an expansion slot for an Ethernet print server (the LaserJet 1300N model comes with the $199 adapter). You can also add an HP JetDirect network adapter for fast Ethernet capabilities (JetDirect 175x 10/100 Base-TX is $159, and the JetDirect 310x is $249) or 802.11b capabilities (JetDirect 802.11b is $199, while the JetDirect 380x 802.11b is $239).
HP includes print-driver language options. The standard is HP PCL 6, but you also have the option of installing HP PCL 5e and PostScript level 2 emulation.

The use of smart devices is expanding in a wide range of business environments. In order to effectively leverage the convenience and versatility of smart-devices in the utilization of documents and images, users are looking for flexible and secure collaboration between smart devices and multifunction products and printers. RICOH Smart Device Print&Scan is a smart device app able to perform printing and scanning by easily and securely connecting smart devices and multifunction products and printers. It is also able to print data residing in cloud storage and upload scanned data to cloud storage. Supporting work styles not bound by the constraints of location, RICOH Smart Device Print&Scan will make your business even smarter. 











* Wireless Direct connections are only supported by models with Smart Operation Panel.
                                 Please see the "Wireless Direct-Capable Models" below for models which support Wireless Direct.
                                 Data from the "Print Web Pages", "Print from Cloud", and "Import with Scanner" functions cannot be stored to the cloud via Wireless Direct.
                                 An access point (Wi-Fi router) is required for all other models.










Features







Print from a variety of sources - easily with your smart device






Print photographs and documents





Using your smart device, you can accurately select and print photographs while previewing the selections. You can also print Microsoft Office* and PDF documents. Information that is hard to read on a smartphone (small characters, tables, etc.) can be easier to see in printed form. The ability to print directly from smart devices without using a PC will speed up office workflow.







Simply open the app, and then select "Print Photograph."




Select the file you want to print, and then select your print settings from print preview.




Confirm your print settings (choose the MFP/Printer that you want to print to, color, paper size, orientation, etc.) and then press "Print" to complete the operation.





You can easily enter various settings (b/w or color, paper size/type, amount of copies, etc.) as you would when printing from a PC. Security has also been considered with locked print, user authentication, and other functions, so the app can be used effectively in an office environment with shared Multifunction products/printers. The "Open In" function on iPad/iPhone and the "Intent" function on Android based devices are also supported for smooth printing operations.
* Only iOS. There may be cases where the print layout is not properly reproduced.

You can also easily print web pages found when doing Web searches with a smart device.






























* The "Print Web Pages" function is not available via Wireless Direct.






Print data from cloud storage





Via a smart device, it is possible to print documents and photographs saved in cloud storage.




























* The "Print from Cloud" function is not available via Wireless Direct.



















Print safely using the security functions








Locked print
For documents that should not be seen by others, you can define a password in advance, and temporarily store them on the Multifunction product/printer. When you are ready to print, you can release their job at the printer by using the locked print or authentication feature to ensure that the job will not be printed until they are ready to pick it up.
































Printing with user authentication
More secure print management is possible when combined with device user authentication. You can also reduce unnecessary printing and control the number of pages printed.

































Follow me style printing
Waiting time can be reduced since it is possible to print on an idle Multifunction product/printer when the designated device is being used.




















































Scan paper documents so they are always close at hand.






Save in smart device





Using the scanner of a multifunction product, it is possible to save paper documents on a smart device as scanned data, so documents are readily available.































Save in cloud storage
It is also possible to send scanned data to cloud storage. Since the data can then be accessed from PCs and other smart devices, it is available for use by a wide range of users.
* Data cannot be stored on the cloud via the "Import with Scanner" function via Wireless Direct.








Save from "Import with Scanner"








































Save from "Scan Data Folder"




































Use the scanned data which was saved
Data saved on the smart device can be accessed in the "Scan Data Folder"*. Scanned data can, of course, be printed, and by using the transmission function of another app, it is possible to send scanned data by email.
*In the case of iOS, for JPEG data it is possible to select the "Scan Data Folder" in the app or the standard "photo" folder.

Before printing







Register printing devices






In order to print using the RICOH Smart Device Print&Scan app, you need to first register the Multifunction products/Printers that you plan to print to from the smart device. The registration can be done using a Bonjour search, by specifying the host name or IP address, or by specifying the print server shared name.





When using a Bonjour search:





















*It is necessary for the MFP/Printer to be located in the same segment.
                                                        *It is necessary that the setting for multifunction product/printer use of the Bonjour protocol be already specified. 





When specifying the host name or IP address:
































*For settings using the host name, it is necessary to be in an environment in which name resolution is possible.





When specifying the print server shared name:





















*The share name must be entered in alphanumeric characters.

Publisher's Description+


                From  Page Technology Marketing: 


    PCLReader views, prints and converts PCL to PDF, PDF/A, TIF, BMP, JPG, PCX, PNG, PWG, PCLm, XPS and ASCII Text.  Once viewed, PCL or Text files can be printed to any Windows printer driver.  This is useful when you have a non-LaserJet PCL printer and need to print an invoice, loan, or other type of PCL document from legacy applications that require PCL4/5/5e LaserJet printers.  ASCII text can also be extracted from the PCL printstream for data migration and archiving purposes.

PCLReader was developed for non-commercial end-users with legacy applications that can only generate PCL output and generic Windows application users with very limited needs to print or convert PCL to PDF output file format. End-users with commercial needs should try PCLWorks Live Evaluation that is available for download from www.pclworks.com.

            

What's new in this version:

                                                    Version 15.10 includes enhanced abilities to generate raster and vector text searchable PDF's and new functions enabling end-users to generate Unicode/UTF8 maps for double-byte language text extraction from PCL.

"It works fine for me."

"Did the job for what I needed to do."

                                    February 02, 2010
                                                     |

                                    Version: PCLReader 8.895
                            

ProsThe software readily read the print file that was in PCL format. I was then able to save the file to a PDF format. Easy to install and uninstall.
ConsThe GUI interface could be a little more user intuitive.
SummaryNot a bad program to read print output files written in PCL format. However, I would hope using such files are rare.  In my case, a camp ground reservation person apparently did not know how to send files usable by most folks (ie: PDF) to send a reservation confirmation. Instead, they sent a print output file. PCLReader saved the day for this type of problem.

ProsI just tried your free PCL Reader program and it was just what I needed. The ability to view and print PCL to any Windows printer saved the day.

PCLReader Program
PCLReader is a commercial quality trialware PCL Viewer and Converter of PCL3 thru PCL6/XL. PCLReader was developed for non-commercial end-users with legacy applications that can only generate PCL output and generic Windows application users with very limited needs to print or convert PCL to PDF output file format.
PCLReader provides non-commercial end-users the ability to view, extract/normalize and print HP PCL print files. PCLReader also converts PCL files into PDF, PDF/A, TIF, BMP, JPG, PCX, PNG, PWG, PCLm, XPS and ASCII Text.
PCLReader V15.1
PCLReader Program: Release Note V15.1 
Program Features
Print PCL to any Windows Printer: This allows users to print PCL on any non_PCL printer, like inkjet, GDI or even PCL XL-only printers.
Convert PCL to PDF: Once in PDF format, you can send converted files as email attachments, post on the web or add to a document archival system for later retrieval. PCLReader also eliminates the need to purchase a PDF driver, which do not work on PCL files anyway.
PCL Form Converter: PCLReader can convert PCL forms into PDF, PDF/A, TIF, XPS, PNG and other file formats so they can be used as overlays in custom applications.
Extract ASCII Text from a PCL: PCLReader can extract text objects found in PCL file and convert them into PageTech's proprietary .TNX format. Then, with TNXDumpG.exe (included) you can format the extracted text into any of 9 different text reporting formats for data migration.
PWG and PCLm Raster Format Support: PCLReader can now convert PCL into PWG and PCLm raster format for Mobile Devices and the Cloud printing that will required inclusion of Job Ticketing metadata.
Job Ticketing: Convert PCL into PCLm and PWG formats while inserting required job ticketing metadata derived from PCL and PJL escape codes (Duplexing, tray commands, color, etc.). Includes the ability to view and edit job ticketing metadata found in these new cloud/mobile formats.
View / Email Interface: After converting files a prompt is provided to either view the output file directly or email the converted file.
PCL Optimizer: PCLReader can edit PCL printstreams for optimal viewing and faster printing.
Eliminate Cost and Requirements to "Stamp" PCL: With PCLReader, there is no need to "stamp" PCL with expensive, proprietary tools just so they can be viewed or converted by yourself or others.
Save Trees:  With PCLReader, you can preview print files to make sure they look right before you print them. And, you can re-print only selected pages - instead of the whole file.

                                    I really like how iSmartAlarm works on a daily basis. Arming/disarming and looking in remotely with a very intuitive Apple-like iPhone app is extremely easy.

                                    I love my iSmartAlarm! I have been a user since they first hit the market and I have been 100% pleased. From competitive pricing to easy setup to consistent upgrades, these folks know their stuff. The alarm is compact, but incredibly powerful. I am a long time user and I plan to stay one!

                                    The iSmartAlarm cameras are fantasic and give me total security when I'm not home. I get all the functionality I need without a hefty price tag like other companies.

PCL-812PG is a multifunction analog and digital I/O card that features the five most desired measurement and control functions for PC/AT and compatible systems: A/D conversion, D/A conversion, digital input, digital output and vounter/timer. This half-size card neatly packages 16 12-bit analog input channels, two 12-bit analog output channels, 16 digital input channels, 16 digital output channels and a programmable counter/timer.In addition to all the features listed above, PCL-812PG offers the convenience of programmable analog input ranges, where the analog input range can be switched by software commands instead of DIP switches. PCL-812PG also delivers convenience and maximum resolution for applications that need different gains for different channels or different gains for different stages of a process. Comprehensive software support, numerous I/O options and a wide range of available daughterboards make the PCL-812PG ideal for industrial applications that require a combination of analog and digital I/O.
