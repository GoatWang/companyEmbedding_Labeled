Since 1938, FENWAL has been dedicated to providing their clients 
                with solutions for, industrial temperature 
                controlling, thermal sensing and control equipment. With its customer 
                focused goal, FENWAL has grown in leaps and bounds and has recently 
                become a part of theWalter Kidde & Co. group. FENWAL’s
Engineering and Manufacturing system is certified to international 
                standard ISO9001.The FENWAL brand of temperature and gas ignition

                excellent performance in the most demanding applications.
Temperature 
                Controllers: 
Among 
                the variety of FENWAL, there are 3 main varieties: The AR44L digital 
                range, the AR24L and the economical FM range. The table below 
                gives a brief overview of the three.

As 
                can be noticed, the AR44L is a very dynamic product. Further, 
                the AR24L is very similar to the AR44L model but has a smaller 
                size.
Digital 
                Temperature Indicators:
The 
                HS FENWAL digital temperature indicator is very versatile and 
                is 96x48mm.When used with K-type thermocouples the range of temperatures 
                that can be measured is 0 to 1200C. When Pt 100 sensors are used, 
                the range can either be 0 to 400C or -100 to +100C.
FENWAL 
                temperature recorders are also available.
Thermocouples:
FENWAL 
                thermocouples for the above temperature controllers are also available
