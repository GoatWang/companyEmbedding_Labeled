	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete audited financial statements.




	 




	The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on its historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair presentation, have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	            Significant Accounting Policies:




	 




	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance. The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue. The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The standard and related amendments will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations, the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the Company’s customer, which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)", ("ASU 2015-11"). Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market value represented by replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2015-11 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.


	The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement and classification in the statement of cash flows were












	7







	 








	adopted prospectively and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards when they occur in determining compensation cost to be recognized each period. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements




	 




	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on it consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) ASU 2016-15 which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,


	“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.”


	This amendment is intended to improve accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. In accordance with this guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

	5.






	Revenue Recognition:




	 




	Revenue on product (software and hardware) and maintenance and subscription agreement sales are recognized once four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the price is fixed and determinable, (3) delivery (software and hardware) or fulfillment (maintenance and subscription) has occurred, and (4) there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenues from the sales of hardware products, software products and licenses, maintenance and subscription agreements are generally recognized on a gross basis upon delivery or fulfillment with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales.




	 




	Product delivery to customers occur in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from the Company’s warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. The Company leverages drop-ship arrangements with many of its vendors and suppliers to deliver products to customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouse, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. The











	8







	 








	Company generally recognizes revenue for drop-ship arrangements on a gross basis. Furthermore, in such drop-ship arrangements, the Company negotiates price with the customer, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers. Maintenance and subscription agreements allow customers to access software and obtain technical support directly from the software publisher and to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced by the software publisher during the period that the maintenance and subscription agreement is in effect. The Company generally serves as the principal with the customer and, therefore, recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped or the contract with respect to maintenance and subscription agreements has been fulfilled as the Company has no future performance obligation.




	 




	Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns.  Vendor rebates and price protection are recorded when earned as a reduction to cost of sales or merchandise inventory, as applicable.




	 




	Cooperative reimbursements from vendors, which are earned and available, are recorded in the period the related advertising expenditure is incurred. Cooperative reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-50 “Ac


	counting by a Customer (including reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor


	.”  Provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns and credit memo analysis which are adjusted to actual on a periodic basis.




	 




	Accounts receivable-long-term result from product sales with extended payment terms that are discounted to their present values at the prevailing market rates at the time of the sale. In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable are increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years. The amounts due under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable and are shown net of reserves.




	 





	6.






	Fair Value:





	 









	The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s accounts receivable long-term is discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates so the balances approximate fair value.

	Credit Facility:




	 




	On January 4, 2013, the Company entered into a $10,000,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) pursuant to a Business Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), Promissory Note (the “Note”), Commercial Security Agreements (the “Security Agreements”) and Commercial Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”).  The Credit Facility matures on January 31, 2019, at which time the Company must pay this loan in one payment of any outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest. The interest rate for any borrowings under the Credit Facility is subject to change from time to time based on the changes in an independent index which is the LIBOR Rate (the “Index”).  If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Citibank may designate a substitute index after notifying the Company.  Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note will be calculated using a rate of 1.500 percentage points over the Index.  The Credit Facility is secured by the assets of the Company.




	 




	Among other affirmative covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement, the Company must maintain (i) a ratio of Total Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth (each as defined in the Loan Agreement) of not greater than 2.50 to 1.00, to be tested quarterly and (ii) a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 2.00 to 1.00.  Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains negative covenants related to, among other items, prohibitions against the creation of certain liens, engaging in any business activities substantially different than those currently engaged in by the Company, and paying dividends on the Company’s stock other than (i) dividends payable in its stock and (ii) cash dividends in amounts and frequency consistent with past practice, without first securing the written consent of Citibank. The Company is in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2017.




	 




	At March 31, 2017, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.

	Earnings Per Share:




	 




	Basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities including unexercised stock option grants and nonvested shares of restricted stock.

	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has identified its federal consolidated tax return and its state tax return in New Jersey and its Canadian tax return as major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions it takes and expects to take on its tax returns, and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.

	Segment Information:




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires that public companies report profits and losses and certain other information on their “reportable operating segments” in their annual and interim financial statements. The internal organization used by the public company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to assess performance and allocate resources determines the basis for reportable operating segments. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.




	 




	The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments.  The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.  The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the United States and Canada.




	 




	As permitted by FASB ASC Topic 280, the Company has utilized the aggregation criteria in combining its operations in Canada with the domestic segments as the Canadian operations provide the same products and services to similar clients and are considered together when the Company’s CODM decides how to allocate resources.




	 




	Segment income is based on segment revenue less the respective segment’s cost of revenues as well as segment direct costs (including such items as payroll costs and payroll related costs, such as profit sharing, incentive awards and insurance) and excluding general and administrative expenses not attributed to an individual segment business unit.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.




	 




	The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of risk and uncertainties, including those set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this report and those set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	 




	Overview




	 




	We distribute software and hardware developed by others through resellers indirectly to customers worldwide. We also resell computer software and hardware developed by others and provide technical services directly to customers in the USA and Canada. In addition, we operate a sales branch in Europe to serve our customers in this region of the world. We offer an extensive line of products from leading publishers of software and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware. We market these products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, social media, direct e-mail, and printed materials.




	 




	The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments.  The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.  The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.




	 




	Factors Influencing Our Financial Results




	 




	We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel. In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.




	 




	We sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required. To date, we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering (“EDI”) and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined.




	 




	Selling general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees. We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business.




	 




	The Company’s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, level of extended payment terms sales transactions, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company’s product offerings. The Company’s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts. If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.




	 




	Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program.


	Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were











	14







	 








	$0.8 and $1.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, respectively. The payment of future dividends and share repurchases is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent on results of operations, projected capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors may find relevant.




	 




	Stock Volatility.


	The technology sector of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility. Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company’s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s Common Stock. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company’s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock.




	 




	Forward Looking Statements




	 




	This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Statements in this report regarding future events or conditions, including but not limited to statements regarding industry prospects and the Company’s expected financial position, results of operations, business and financing plans, are forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” and “continue” or similar words.




	 




	Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Substantial risks and uncertainties unknown at this time could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the continued acceptance of the Company’s distribution channel by vendors and customers, the timely availability and acceptance of new products, product mix, market conditions, competitive pricing pressures, contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs, including vendor rebates and discounts, as well as factors that affect the software industry in general and other factors generally. We strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in this report and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 




	The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.




	 




	Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.




	 




	The statements concerning future sales, future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward looking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products, product mix, pricing pressures, market conditions and other factors, which could result in a fluctuation of sales below recent experience.




	 




	Financial Overview




	 




	Net sales increased 21%, or $19.5 million, to $112.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $93.3 million for the same period in 2016. Gross profit increased 14%, or $0.8 million, to $6.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $6.0 million in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 11%, or $0.5 million, to $5.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $4.5 million in the same period last year.  Net income increased 28%, or $0.3 million, to $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1.0 million in the same period last year. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 5% from the prior year, primarily due to the Company’s shares repurchased. Income per share-diluted increased 36% to

	$0.30 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.22 for the same period in 2016, partially due to the decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding.




	 




	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	 




	Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Revenues from the sales of hardware products, software products, licenses, maintenance and subscription agreements are generally recognized on a gross basis upon delivery or fulfillment, with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales.




	 




	On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.




	 




	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.




	 




	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.




	 




	Allowance for Accounts Receivable




	 




	The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.


	Management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including:  historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, and specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers.


	If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience. If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.




	 




	Accounts Receivable – Long Term




	 




	The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates. In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors.




	 




	Inventory Allowances




	 




	The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

	Share-Based Payments




	 




	Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.




	 




	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific guidance. The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue. The new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The standard and related amendments will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations, the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the Company’s customer, which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)", ("ASU 2015-11"). Topic 330, Inventory, currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, with market value represented by replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2015-11 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.


	The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement and classification in the statement of cash flows were adopted prospectively and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards when they occur in determining compensation cost to be recognized each period. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on it consolidated financial statements.

	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) ASU 2016-15 which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,


	“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.”


	This amendment is intended to improve accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. In accordance with this guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

	Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 21%, or $19.5 million, to $112.8 million, compared to $93.3 million for the same period in 2016. Net sales increased in both our Lifeboat Distribution segment and our TechXtend segment.




	 




	Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased $18.1 million, or 21% to $104.5 million, compared to $86.3 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and distribution accounts due to competitive bid situations. We operate in a competitive market in which some sales agreements are subject to periodic competitive bidding processes, resulting in fluctuations from year to year based on the outcome.




	 




	TechXtend segment net sales increased $1.3 million or 19% to $8.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $7.0 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher sales to enterprise and public sector accounts.




	 




	During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we relied on two key customers for a total of 43.4% of our revenue. One major customer accounted for 21.8% and the other for 21.6%, respectively, of our total net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  These same customers accounted for 29.9% and 10.7%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2017.

	Gross Profit




	 




	Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 14% or $0.8 million, to $6.8 million, compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 13% to $5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $5.2 million for the same period in the prior year. TechXtend segment gross profit increased 15% to $0.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes somewhat offset by competitive pressures on gross profit margins as discussed below.




	 




	Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 6.0% compared to 6.4% for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 5.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 6.0% for the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was primarily caused by competitive pricing pressure and product mix. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been for gross profit margins to decline for the past several years. We attribute some of the decline to an increasing portion of our revenues coming from the sale of licenses, maintenance and service agreements that are not associated with a physical product. While our gross profit margin has declined on these products, we have instituted operational efficiencies such as electronic ordering and distribution through the use of EDI and other automation that increase our productivity and enable us to maintain profitability. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 11.0% compared to 11.5% for the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to competitive market pricing, particularly on larger enterprise and public sector sales. Sales of large enterprise licenses and related equipment typically carry a lower gross profit margin, and lower incremental selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue, than smaller account sales.




	 




	Vendor rebates and discounts for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $0.5 million compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year. Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors. The Company monitors vendor rebate levels, competitive pricing, and gross profit margins carefully. We anticipate that price competition in our market will continue in both of our business segments.




	 




	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses




	 




	SG&A expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million or 11% to $5.0 million, compared to $4.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased employee related expenses




	(salaries, commissions, and bonus) to support our growth. SG&A expenses were 4.4% of net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and 4.8% for the same period in 2016.




	 




	The Company expects that its SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, may vary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives. We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring SG&A expenses closely.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million or 32.0% of income, compared to $0.5 million or 33.9% of income for the same period in 2016.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in tax effects related to share based payments at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.




	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.4 million to $11.1 million at March 31, 2017 from $13.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily due to lower cash from operating activities and related changes in working capital, and increased cash used in financing activities related to stock repurchases and dividends.




	 




	Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $0.2 million, comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $1.7 million, offset by cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million.




	 















	19







	 












	The increase in cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net working capital (accounts receivable and inventory, less accounts payable) required to support our business. The increased working capital requirement is driven by increased sales levels and extended payment terms for one of our major reseller customers.




	 




	In the quarter ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million, compared to less than $0.1 million in the same quarter in prior year.




	 




	Net cash used in financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $2.5 million was comprised of $0.8 million of dividend payments on our Common Stock, and $1.7 million for the stock repurchases. 




	 




	On January 4, 2013. the Company entered into a $10,000,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) pursuant to a Business Loan Agreement, Promissory Note (the “Note”), Commercial Security Agreements and Commercial Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”). The Credit Facility, which is intended to be used for business and working capital purposes, including financing of larger extended payment terms sales transactions which may become a more significant portion of the Company’s net sales. On December 18, 2015, the Company signed an extension to this agreement, which extended the maturity date to January 31, 2019 with all other terms remaining the same (See Note 8 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility.




	 




	We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings on our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and  Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer , Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT




	THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the “


	Agreement


	”) is made and entered into as of [______, 20__], by and between Wayside Technology Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “


	Company


	”), and [_____________] (“


	Indemnitee


	”).




	WITNESSETH THAT:




	WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve corporations as directors, officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;




	WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “


	Board


	”) has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities.  Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions.  At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself. The Company’s  Certificate of Incorporation (as amended and/or amended and restated from time to time, the “


	Certificate of Incorporation


	”) and Bylaws (as amended and/or amended and restated from time to time, the “


	Bylaws


	”) require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company.  Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“


	DGCL


	”).  The Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification;




	WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;




	WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and that


















	 







	                                 







	the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;




	WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;




	WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and




	WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.  Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he or she be so indemnified.




	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee’s agreement to serve as an officer and/or director from and after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows:








	Indemnity of Indemnitee


	.  The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time.  In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the generality thereof:








	Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company


	.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this


	Section l(a)


	if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this


	Section 1(a)


	, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.








	Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company


	.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this


	Section 1(b)


	if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this


	Section 1(b)


	, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee, or on the Indemnitee’s behalf, in connection with such Proceeding if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company;


	provided


	,  


	however


	, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall determine that such indemnification may be made.







	Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful


	.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.  For purposes of this


	Section 1(c)


	and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.








	Additional Indemnity


	.  In addition to, and without regard to any limitations on, the indemnification provided for in


	Section 1


	of this Agreement, the Company shall and hereby does indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, he or she is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company), including, without limitation, all liability arising out of the negligence or active or passive wrongdoing of Indemnitee.  The only limitation that shall exist upon the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall be that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment to Indemnitee that is finally determined (under the procedures, and subject to the presumptions, set forth in


	Sections 6


	and


	7


	hereof) to be unlawful.








	Contribution


	.






	Whether or not the indemnification provided in


	Sections 1


	and


	2


	hereof is available, in respect of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee.  The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee.






	Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in


	Section 3(a)


	, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction or events from which such Proceeding arose;


	provided


	,  


	however


	, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the transaction or events that resulted in such Expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which applicable law may require to be considered.  The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.





	The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.






	To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, and without diminishing or impairing the obligation of the Company in the preceding subsections of this


	Section 3


	, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents, other than Indemnitee) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).








	Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness


	.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a witness, or is made (or asked) to respond to discovery requests, in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he or she shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.








	Advancement of Expenses


	.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, promptly after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced within thirty (30) days of a final determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.  Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this


	Section 5


	shall be unsecured and interest free and shall not be conditional on Indemnitee’s ability to repay such advances.







	Procedures and Presumptions for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification


	.  It is the intent of this Agreement to secure for Indemnitee rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the DGCL and public policy of the State of Delaware.  Accordingly, the parties agree that the following procedures and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement:






	To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Indemnitee to provide such a request to the Company, or to provide such a request in a timely fashion, shall not relieve the Company of any liability that it may have to Indemnitee unless, and to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the interests of the Company.






	Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of


	Section 6(a)


	hereof, a determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the Board:  (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the written request of Indemnitee following a Change in Control, the determination shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board.






	If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to


	Section 6(b)


	hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this


	Section 6(c)


	.  The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and written notice of such selection shall be delivered to Indemnitee; provided that following a Change in Control, the Independent Counsel will be selected by Indemnitee and notice thereof shall be delivered to the Company.  Indemnitee (or the Company, after a Change in Control) may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company (or the Indemnitee, after a Change in Control) a written objection to such selection;


	provided


	,  


	however


	, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “


	Independent Counsel


	” as defined in


	Section 13


	of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.  If a written objection is made and substantiated, (i) the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit, and (ii) the Company (or the Indemnitee), after a Change in Control) may, at its option, select an alternative Independent Counsel and give written notice to the Indemnitee (or the Company, after a Change in Control) advising the Indemnitee (or the Company, after a Change in Control) of the identity of the alternative Independent Counsel so selected, in which case the provisions of the two immediately preceding sentences, the introductory clause of this sentence and subclause (i) of this sentence shall apply to such subsequent selection and notice.  If applicable, the provisions of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to such successive alternate selections.  If, within 30 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to


	Section 6(a)


	hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Indemnitee (or the Company, after a Change in Control) to the Company’s (or the Indemnitee’s, after a Change in Control) selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under


	Section 6(b)


	hereof.  The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to


	Section 6(b)


	hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this


	Section 6(c)


	, regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.







	In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.  Neither the failure of the Company (including by its Disinterested Directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its Disinterested Directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.








	Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise (as hereinafter defined), including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise  in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise.  In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this


	Section 6(e)


	are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.







	If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under


	Section 6


	to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law;


	provided


	,  


	however


	, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and/or information relating thereto.








	Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any Independent Counsel or member of the Board shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding the Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement.  Any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.








	The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty.  In the event that any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such Proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration), it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such Proceeding.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.






	The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.








	Remedies of Indemnitee


	.







	In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to


	Section 6


	of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to


	Section 5


	of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification is made pursuant to


	Section 6(b)


	of this Agreement within the applicable time period set forth above after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor or (v) payment of indemnification is not made within thirty (30) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to


	Section 6


	of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of Indemnitee’s entitlement to such indemnification.  Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this


	Section 7(a)


	.  The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication.






	In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to


	Section 6(b)


	of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this


	Section 7


	shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of the adverse determination under


	Section 6(b)


	.






	If a determination shall have been made pursuant to


	Section 6(b)


	of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this


	Section 7


	, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s misstatement not materially misleading in connection with the application for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.






	In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this


	Section 7


	, seeks a judicial adjudication of his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, or to recover under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, the Company shall pay on Indemnitee’s behalf, in advance, any and all expenses (of the types described under the definition of Expenses in


	Section 13


	of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in such judicial adjudication, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance recovery.






	The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this


	Section 7


	that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery, as the case may be.





	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.








	Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Primacy of Indemnification; Subrogation


	.






	The rights of indemnification as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, a resolution of the Board or the Disinterested Directors, or otherwise.  No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.  To the extent that a change in the DGCL, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.






	To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy providing liability insurance for directors and officers of the Company and of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy in accordance with its terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director or officer under such policy.  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.






	In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.






	The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.





	The Company’s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.








	Exception to Right of Indemnification


	. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:






	for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision; or






	for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law; or






	in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation, or (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law.








	Duration of Agreement


	.  All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee is an officer or director of the Company (or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) and shall continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any Proceeding (or any proceeding commenced under


	Section 7


	hereof) by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status, whether or not Indemnitee is acting or serving in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), assigns, spouses, heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.








	Security


	.  To the extent requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company may at any time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the Company’s obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral.  Any such security, once provided to Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee.







	Enforcement


	.

	Except as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.






	The Company shall not seek from a court, or agree to, a “bar order” which would have the effect of prohibiting or limiting the Indemnitee’s rights to receive advancement of Expenses under this Agreement.

EATONTOWN, N.J., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Friday, July 28, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The dial-in telephone number is (844) 683-0552 and the pass code is “WSTG.”  This conference call will be webcast by NASDAQ OMX and can be accessed at Wayside Technology’s website at www.waysidetechnology.com/site/content/webcasts.






“We are pleased to report solid financial results. Our Lifeboat Distribution segment continued to deliver year over year sales growth, while our TechXtend division was down as compared to an exceptionally strong quarter last year. We see opportunities for growth in the remainder of this year,” said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “On a year to date basis, our earnings per share are up $0.04 or 7%.” 
Operating Results:
Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 2% to $103.0 million compared to $105.3 million for the same period in 2016 as growth in our Lifeboat Distribution segment was offset by a decline in TechXtend due to quarterly variability in enterprise account sales. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 7% to $95.7 million, compared to $89.7 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 53% to $7.3 million, compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a large enterprise sale of approximately $7.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016 which affects the comparability of results. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 6% to $6.6 million compared to $7.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 1% to $5.6 million, compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit for the second quarter of 2017 decreased 34% to $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million in 2016.
Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 6.4%, compared to 6.7% for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9%, compared to 6.2% for the same period last year. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 3.8 percentage points to 13.1%, compared to 9.3% for the same period in 2016.
Total selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 2% or $0.1 million over the same quarter last year to $4.8 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased employee related expenses to support our growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016 as a result of the lower TechXtend sales.
Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 16% to $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 12% to $0.30, compared to $0.34, for the same period in 2016. 
On July 25, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable August 18, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2017.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million.

Overall, revenue increased 14% to a record $105.3 million and income from operations increased 14% over the same period last year," said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.Net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 increased 14% or $13.3 million to a record $105.3 million compared to $92.0 million for the same period in 2015.

Total sales for the second quarter of 2016 for our TechXtend segment were $15.6 million compared to $10.7 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing an increase of $4.9 million or 46%.The 10% increase in net sales for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was mainly a result of the addition of several key product lines and our ongoing strategy of strengthening of our account penetration. This was offset in part by lower sales to one of our key accounts. The 46% increase in net sales in the TechXtend segment was primarily due to an increase of $5.6 million in extended payment terms sales transactions as compared to the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.Cash and long term receivables amounted to $30.5 million, representing 79% of equity as of June 30, 2016.

The decrease in gross profit margin for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was primarily caused by a program change by one of our main vendors, causing gross margins to decline by 1.8% for that line. Gross profit margin for our TechXtend segment for the second quarter of 2016 was 9.3% compared to 12.3% for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in gross profit margin for the TechXtend segment was primarily caused by the increase in extended payment sales transaction which carry lower margins.Total selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $4.8 million compared to $4.4 million for the second quarter of 2015, representing an increase of $0.4 million or 7%. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in stock compensation and amounts accrued for bonus expense in 2016 compared to 2015.

(WSTG) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Friday, July 28, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The dial-in telephone number is (844) 683-0552 and the pass code is “WSTG.”  This conference call will be webcast by NASDAQ OMX and can be accessed at Wayside Technology’s website at www.waysidetechnology.com/site/content/webcasts.“We are pleased to report solid financial results. Our Lifeboat Distribution segment continued to deliver year over year sales growth, while our TechXtend division was down as compared to an exceptionally strong quarter last year. We see opportunities for growth in the remainder of this year,” said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “On a year to date basis, our earnings per share are up $0.04 or 7%.” Operating Results:Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 2% to $103.0 million compared to $105.3 million for the same period in 2016 as growth in our Lifeboat Distribution segment was offset by a decline in TechXtend due to quarterly variability in enterprise account sales. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 7% to $95.7 million, compared to $89.7 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 53% to $7.3 million, compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a large enterprise sale of approximately $7.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016 which affects the comparability of results. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 6% to $6.6 million compared to $7.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 1% to $5.6 million, compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit for the second quarter of 2017 decreased 34% to $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million in 2016.Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 6.4%, compared to 6.7% for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9%, compared to 6.2% for the same period last year. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 3.8 percentage points to 13.1%, compared to 9.3% for the same period in 2016.Total selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 2% or $0.1 million over the same quarter last year to $4.8 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased employee related expenses to support our growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016 as a result of the lower TechXtend sales.Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 16% to $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 12% to $0.30, compared to $0.34, for the same period in 2016. On July 25, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable August 18, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2017.For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million.About Wayside Technology Group, Inc.Wayside Technology Group, Inc.

Wayside Technology Group, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results and Declares Quarterly DividendHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Wayside Technology Group, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results and Declares Quarterly DividendMarketwireOctober 25, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareSHREWSBURY, NJ--(Marketwire - Oct 25, 2012) -   Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  WSTG ) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Friday, October 26, 2012 at 10:00 AM Eastern time. The dial-in telephone number is (866) 961-5936 and the pass code is "WSTG." This conference call will be available via live webcast -- in listen-mode only -- at www.earnings.com. A replay will also be available on the company's website at www.waysidetechnology.com.Cash and marketable securities amounted to $15.3 million, representing 49% of equity as of September 30, 2012. Working capital amounted to $20.5 million, representing 66% of equity as of September 30, 2012.Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 increased 19% or $11.8 million to $75.5 million compared to $63.7 million for the same period in 2011. Net sales for the third quarter of 2012 for our Lifeboat Distribution segment were $56.0 million compared to $49.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, representing an increase of $6.9 million or 14%. Net sales for the third quarter of 2012 for our TechXtend segment were $19.5 million compared to $14.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, representing an increase of $4.9 million or 34%."The third quarter of 2012 has been our best quarter YTD in terms of revenues, gross profit, income from operations and net income. Our TechXtend division performed especially well in Q3 with our Lifeboat Distribution segment delivering solid results," said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We continued to increase our market share and grow our service offerings."The 19% increase in net sales in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly a result of strengthening of our account penetration, our continued focus on the expanding virtual infrastructure-centric business, our solution focus selling and the addition of several key product lines.Gross Profit for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 was $5.7 million, a 1% decrease as compared to $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2011. Gross profit for our Lifeboat Distribution segment for the third quarter of 2012 was $3.7 million compared to $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, representing a 10% decrease. The decrease in gross profit for the Lifeboat Distribution segment was due to lower vendor rebate attainment and competitive pricing pressure within this segment. Gross profit for our TechXtend segment was $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, representing a 21% increase. The increase in gross profit in the TechXtend segment was the result of the increased sales volume, at a lower gross margin as compared to 2011 and lower vendor rebates. Vendor rebates and discounts for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 amounted to $0.5 million compared to $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2011. Vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors. Vendors have been periodically substantially increasing their target revenues for rebate eligibility. Therefore, despite our increasing revenue, vendor rebates have declined.Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 was 7.5% compared to 9.0% for the third quarter of 2011. The attainment of gross profit dollars and the decrease in gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were primarily caused by the increased competitive pricing pressure and decrease in rebates in both segments and by winning several large bids based on aggressive pricing, which we plan to continue.Total selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the third quarter of 2012 were $3.6 million compared to $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2011, which was mainly the result of an increase in sales commissions for our TechXtend division, and the addition of employees in sales, finance and operations to support business growth. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses for third quarter of 2012 were 4.8% compared to 5.4% for the third quarter of 2011.On October 23, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.16 per share of its common stock payable November 16, 2012 to shareholders of record on November 6, 2012.About Wayside Technology Group, Inc.Wayside Technology Group, Inc.
