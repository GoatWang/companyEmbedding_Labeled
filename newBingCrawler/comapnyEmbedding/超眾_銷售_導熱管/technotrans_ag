Product designation
spray.xact

LUBRICATION SYSTEM FOR PUNCHING AND FORMING INDUSTRIES

A new generation for the precise and sparing application of oil without unwanted spray mist

spray.xact is a highly flexible, easily adaptable solution for the precise, non-contact application of oils and watery solutions on to board or coils. The spray jet is created using a high-frequency pulsing valve with a 1-substance nozzle. This eliminates the use of cost-intensive compressed air at  the nozzles, which is used in conventional units and causes spray mist.

Ink movement
INK AGITATORAn innovative, easy, and user-friendly solution for maintaining the stability of printing inks in the ink duct.
Especially developed for high-viscosity inks, including UV inks, which tend to “stand still“ in the ink duct. ink.mate can be used efficiently on all kinds of sheetfed, continuous and web offset presses.
ink.mate distributes via one or two rotating agitator cones the ink evenly over the entire width of the ink duct and keeps the viscosity of thixotropic links low over the entire width of the duct. This also keeps the edge areas constantly in motion. In addition, ink is applied to the ductor – a basic prerequisitefor good printing results.
The low-maintenance unit can be installed easily, even for retrofits. The compact design guarantees easy access to the ink duct. This allows uninterrupted cleaning of the ink duct and the agitator cone.
The ink.mate is switched on or off via the air valve. The speed of the cone is set via the control unit. This is how the ink.mate is adjusted to the requirements of the individual orders.
BASIC VERSION INK.MATE BASICBeyond the top technology technotrans provides with the ink.mate basic a compact solution to keep highly viscous colors - also UV / HUV - in motion. The agitator cone is replaced by a rigid stirring element, which is guided via a pneumatic cylinder back and forth – up in the fringe of the ink duct. The speed of the ink.mate basic is also adjustable. The ink.mate basic impresses by its extremely space-saving design. It is use used preferentially in combination with the automatic ink duct filling device auto.fill of technotrans and can simply be clipped onto the ink filling tube.

 Product category: Ink supply systems   
Central ink supply
technotrans ink supply systems help printing companies save significant amounts of time. Depending on the construction stage, beginning with supplying ink from 2kg cartridges for offset printing to the central ink supply from bulk containers of up to 20,000 litres for newspaper printing, this task becomes secondary for daily operations.
The continuous printing process is supported, there is order in the press room, and the printers have more time for their important jobs.
technotrans is among the world leaders with more than 25 years of experience in the development and construction of central ink supply systems for offset printing presses. You too can benefit from our innovative, proven concepts.

 Product category: Heat recovery   
Heat recovery
The productivity in the press room is continuously increasing. Modern presses reach output of 18,000 sheets per hour. This also changes the requirements for the machines peripheral equipment.
The dampening solution circulation, ink unit temperature control, dryer, blast feed and vacuum supply must perform better, but also generate significantly more waste heat.
Air-cooled equipment usually simply discharges this heat into the nearest surroundings. This releases energy that has great impact on relative humidity and the air temperature and makes maintaining stable production conditions significantly more difficult.
Central water cooling works against these effects. It channels all heat and energy that remains in the press room environment without impact and thereby supports a high level of process stability.
Advantages at a glance:

low and easily controllable air temperature in the printing room
no overload of existing ventilation and air conditioning systems
lower air velocity in the press room resulting in less distributed dust
reduced maintenance effort for peripheral units
lower heating energy requirements
horizontal or vertical installation
different capacities and sound pressure levels available
