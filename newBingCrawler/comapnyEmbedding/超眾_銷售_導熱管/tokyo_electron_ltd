Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: May 26, 2009

 To maximize their effectiveness, color cases should be printed in color.Tokyo Electron Ltd. operates in a constrained innovation environment, defined by modular boundaries that are long standing in the industry that it serves, the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. While the original motivation for these boundaries was division of labor and partitioning of a complex problem into manageable pieces, the company is now faced with a new innovation that crosses these boundaries and offers the opportunity to significantly improve the yield and performance of the manufacturing process. While the technical solution is straightforward, it is not clear that the company's customers are prepared to accept such a change because it would cross organizational lines that manufacturers have established for control purposes. The case frames the technical question and poses the organizational question.

Initiatives for improving quality








TEL is continually improving the quality of its products to win customer satisfaction and trust. An important statement from the quality policy is that “We build quality into every TEL product during the design phase by focusing on leading-edge technology. By bringing quality into our processes early and focusing on quality throughout all processes, we succeed in providing high quality products and services.” This is the foundation of our quality assurance activities.Specifically, we have adopted the front-loading approach. This involves identifying and solving problems early in the product development and design processes to enhance design quality. In addition, we have expanded our training programs and established a system to verify skill levels in order to improve individual skills and design quality, ultimately ensuring proper identification of problems and appropriate analysis.In addition, we implement in-process quality control1 during each process-from development and design to shipment. Semiconductor production equipment consists of various components and modules, and assembly involves multiple processes. Making each of the manufacturing processes responsible for component quality is very effective, significantly reducing production costs and defects. Each of our process teams constantly seeks improvement, helping to produce superior products by taking ownership of quality assurance within a given process.Because the quality of each component can affect the overall quality of the end product, we also focus on the quality of components early in the design phase. TEL’s development and quality assurance divisions exchange information among themselves and with suppliers in order to improve the quality of drawings and purchase specifications. This also enables early sharing of component information. As a result, the quality of components has improved, leading to fewer component defects.1 in-process quality control: The idea that, at each process, employees take responsibility to ensure product quality with no defects

To promote high-quality manufacturing in alignment with customer needs, TEL continually carries out cross-functional quality improvement activities with involvement of not only its development and design departments but also other departments such as planning, sales, administration and field service. As part of these efforts, we encourage TEL employees to obtain external quality certification. Administered by the Japanese Standards Association and the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers, the QM/QC Exam (Quality Management and Quality Control Examination) is a major quality certification, with more than 363,000 certification holders in Japan as of September 2015. The certification enables employees to improve their knowledge and skills in the area of quality control, improve the quality of their work, and provide customers with high-quality products. Starting in fiscal year 2012, this initiative has increased the number of certified employees each year to a total of 1,273 as of March 2016.In addition, we are also educating our employees in the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) cycle. Although PDCA is most frequently used to improve management of production and quality, we have chosen to employ this method in every aspect of our business, not just in production activities. PDCA is already being used in many areas, driving process efficiency and greater value for our customers.

Response to quality problems








Despite our efforts to produce high-quality products with the front-loading approach, in-process quality control, and employee education, unforeseen quality problems occur from time to time. When any such problem is reported by customers, the information is fed into our proprietary Q-VICS knowledge management system. This information is distributed to the departments concerned, enabling information sharing and quick problem resolution. If disclosure of defect information is deemed necessary based on our internal criteria, we issue necessary technical documents and inform our customers.For particularly serious problems, we employ the TEL 6-Step problem-solving model, a customized version of the eight discipline (8D) problem solving method1 widely used in quality management. The TEL 6-step model enables systematic and highly reliable analysis of a problem to determine the root cause, leading to quick implementation of countermeasures and preventing recurrence of similar problems. We are currently training our personnel to actively use this method.When a quality issue occurring in one business unit has the potential to affect other business units, we use a proprietary system called QABOX to prevent the problem from spreading. The system allows relevant information to be centrally managed on our secure network. The information is shared with quality assurance managers at TEL manufacturing companies and with the corporate quality division to discuss appropriate resolution. Following the discussion, critical information is reported to the corporate executive officer in charge of quality to quickly determine the future actions on the issue.1 8D problem solving method : A quality improvement method for solving problems through eight disciplines or processes TOKYO ELECTRON

Environmentally friendly products












The total CO2 emissions from the TEL value chain (including raw material procurement and product manufacture, transport, use, and disposal) was calculated according to the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol. Emissions arising from product use currently account for 90% of our total emissions. For this reason, TEL has made it a key corporate objective to promote environmentally friendly product design and has been striving to lower the energy consumption of its products. In fiscal year 2015, TEL established a goal to reduce energy and pure water consumption by 10% by fiscal year 2019 (using fiscal year 2014 consumption as the baseline). In fiscal year 2016, TEL expanded the scope of this program to include products produced by its overseas subsidiaries. TEL also monitored TEL’s global energy use while seeking to improve overall throughput. In addition, the percentage of sales of energy-saving models* increased to 84.8% of the total product sales.To reduce the overall environmental impact of our products at our customers’ sites, we must examine our primary equipment, peripherals, associated facilities, and management of our own factories. Increasing the operational efficiency of the entire production system is increasingly important, along with encouraging energy-efficient operations of our customers’ sites. We will continue to focus on monitoring and controlling our energy use. We also plan to demonstrate the importance of energy saving measures through compliance with SEMI S23, a semiconductor industry standard for assessing energy conservation.To meet our goals, we are promoting environmentally friendly manufacturing through development of new technologies, further reduction in the use of energy, water, and chemicals, and proactive measures to contain greenhouse gases.* Based on in-house standardsEnergy conservation features of TiN metallization systemThin film deposition is a key process in semiconductor manufacturing. Conventionally, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)1 was the technology of choice for this process; however, the need for continued semiconductor miniaturization from our customers called for development of new equipment based on the Advanced Sequential Flow Deposition (ASFD)2 process technology. This new technology not only enables deposition of nanoscale film with highly engineered properties, but can also be implemented at temperatures lower than those for CVD, making it a superior deposition technology in terms of energy conservation.TEL’s TiN metallization system was developed in response to this shift in process technologies. Due largely to its low temperature processing and idle-time energy conservation feature, the system achieved a 50% reduction in per wafer energy consumption in fiscal year 2014 as compared with its performance in fiscal year 2008.The latest Triase+TM EX-ⅡTM TiN Plus model features a newly developed reactor chamber and unique gas injection mechanism to attain significant improvement in throughput while reducing the energy consumption level to 40% of the previous model. As a result, the new model achieved the corporate target of reducing energy consumption per wafer by 10% from the fiscal year 2014 level. This is three years ahead of the fiscal year 2019 deadline.1 CVD: A method for depositing thin films on substrates by decomposing source materials using thermal and/or chemical processes.2 ASFD: Advanced Sequential Flow Deposition, a low-temperature processing method for forming nanoscale metal films with highly-engineered properties.

Management of chemical substances contained in products




To achieve our goal of manufacturing environmentally friendly products, TEL has set up a system for managing hazardous chemicals in our products. In addition, we proactively collect information on relevant laws and regulations in Japan and abroad to properly ensure compliance. For example, when any substance of very high concern (SVHC) is present in our products at a level of 0.1% or higher, we disclose the information appropriately, based on EU REACH1 regulations. We also provide safety data sheets (SDS) on the chemicals we use, in accordance with GHS2 requirements.To comply more effectively with regulations such as REACH and China RoHS3, in April 2015 we conducted a survey of our Japanese suppliers regarding the chemicals contained in their products based on the JAMP AIS4.In fiscal year 2016, we expanded the previous year’s Seminar on Design for Environmental Compliance and offered the course not only to managers but also to staff members from relevant departments. The seminar consisted of an overview of frequently revised environmental laws and regulations, lectures on target chemicals, and comprehension tests. About 5,000 employees took the course during the fiscal year.We will continue to closely monitor and appropriately respond to relevant laws and regulations worldwide, further increasing our global efforts to reduce hazardous chemical substances.1 EU REACH: EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. An EU regulation pertaining to the registration, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemicals.2 GHS: Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals3 China RoHS: Chinese regulation on materials including lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Businesses are required to provide customers with relevant information on the use of these materials.4 JAMP AIS: Article Information Sheet (AIS) promoted by the Joint Article Management Promotion-consortium (JAMP). This sheet is used to communicate basic information on regulated chemical substances contained in products.

Logistics initiatives




Environmental considerations in logisticsBecause of worldwide environmental concerns such as global climate change and the rising demand to reduce the environmental burden of logistics activities, transportation regulations are becoming more stringent. TEL continues to adjust its logistics operations to meet these demands.CO2 reduction initiativesTEL’s CO2 emissions from domestic logistics operations are monitored and calculated within the scope of regulation defined by the Act on the Rational Use of Energy. In our overseas logistics operations, CO2 emissions are monitored and calculated based on the data from our intra-company logistics and product shipments to customers. TEL has been implementing modal shifts1 to transportation methods that are less environmentally harmful, where applicable. For example, we have adopted ocean shipment for some semiconductor and FPD production equipment and are making efforts to reduce production lead time to compensate for the extra time it takes to ship by ocean rather than by air. We have extended the use of shelved trolleys from the shipment of FPD production equipment to semiconductor production equipment as well, thereby improving the load factor of trucks and reducing both CO2 emissions and cost. Our CO2 emissions in fiscal year 2016 were 65 kilotons, down about 11% year-over-year. This is primarily due to the increase in the ratio of outbound international ocean shipments.1 Modal shift: A change in the mode of transport; specifically, switching from conventional freight transport by truck or aircraft to a means that has a lower impact on the environment, such as rail or ocean. Resource-saving initiativesBecause TEL ’s products are precision equipment, they must be shipped with care and in clean conditions, requiring the use wooden crates and cardboard boxes. To conserve some of these resources, TEL uses recyclable cardboard boxes for packaging. After the equipment has been shipped and installed, casters and other specialized transport fixtures are collected and brought back to TEL factories for reuse. These are only a few examples of TEL’s resource-saving efforts.

Product reuse and recycling








With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), semiconductors are in greater demand and are becoming more diverse than ever. This has driven a corresponding rise in the need for more varied semiconductor production equipment. As a leading manufacturer of semiconductor equipment, TEL is strongly encouraging reuse and recycling of equipment and components by marketing refurbished TEL equipment and offering modification services to customers who already have TEL equipment installed. Our refurbished equipment operations start with procuring used equipment from the market, which takes place either directly or through leasing companies. This equipment is then properly tested and refurbished, before being offered to customers as TEL Certified Used Equipment. Our equipment modification services boost the productivity of installed equipment by maintaining and improving its quality and availability. Through these approaches, we address our customers’ cost, speed, and performance needs, while also contributing to waste reduction and resource conservation and utilization. These efforts help reduce the use of resources and CO2 emissions associated with procuring and manufacturing equipment and components. They are also effective in reducing the costs of production, logistics, and waste disposal.
