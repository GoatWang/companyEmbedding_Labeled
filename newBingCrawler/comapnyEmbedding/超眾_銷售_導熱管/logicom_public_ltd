ALSO continues international expansion of cloud marketplace platform
                2017-04-06
Swiss broadliner ALSO and Intcomex have signed a strategic partnership to bring a wide range of local and global vertical-focused cloud services to SMB and Enterprise customers in Latin America in 2017. Both companies are joining forces to make the ALSO Cloud Marketplace Platform as a Service (PaaS) available to more than 50,000 Intcomexs' channel partners in 14 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with plans to expand further in the region. ALSO enables Intcomex to expand their Software as a Service (SaaS) catalogue to their customers. Spearheaded by Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program (CSP), the platform assists local vertical-focused ISVs to expand towards channels.
"We generate additional growth opportunities through strategic partnerships like the one with Intcomex in new, dynamic regions. Combined with our strong presence in Europe and our partnerships in the UK and Ireland, the Middle-East and Southeast Asia, through the partnership with Intcomex the ALSO Cloud Marketplace platform is now reaching nearly 50 countries globally", said Gustavo Möller-Hergt, CEO of ALSO Holding AG. "Intcomex is a frontrunner of cloud services in its region, driving this paradigm change of the market. We are serving a fast-growing network of partners, including ISVs, hosters and managed service providers. The strategic partnership with ALSO will enable us to expand our SaaS portfolio further and to focus on an exceptional customer experience together", said Michael Shalom, Group Managing Director of Intcomex.
In October 2016, ALSO agreed on a strategic partnership with Innovix Distribution to make the ALSO Cloud Marketplace available to 5,500 of Innovix' channel partners starting in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, with plans to expand further in the region. Earlier in June the same year, ALSO signed a strategic partnership with Logicom to provide the marketplace platform to more than 10,000 Logicom partners in 13 countries in Southern Europe and the Middle East, with plans to expand further in the region. In December 2015, ALSO and Westcoast agreed on a strategic cooperation to bring the ALSO Cloud Marketplace platform to Westcoast customers in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Logicom sign several new partnerships
                2016-12-16
Broadliner Logicom has signed distribution agreements with TeamViewer (remote support, remote access, and online meeting software) and Microsoft. Through TeamViewer partnership, Logicom will distribute all TeamViewer software in the regions in which it operates (through its offices in Bahrain, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malta, Oman, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates) providing its specialized reseller network with the full range of products and support encompassing the TeamViewer platform. Logicom's Director of Distribution, Michael Papaeracleous, said: "We have been consistently focusing on creating programs and support mechanisms that accelerate the business of our partners and we believe that our coverage can offer unique value to leading Technology vendors that want to extend their channel capabilities. We welcome the addition of the TeamViewer solution set to our brand portfolio and we are very excited to enter areas of the market that we have not addressed until now." Konstantin Ebert, Director of Global Channel Sales at TeamViewer, adds: "we are thrilled about this agreement with Logicom because it allows us to significantly extend our presence in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Logicom certainly has superb expertise and the experience it takes to distribute technology solutions like ours."
The Microsoft contract has two sides. Through the first, Logicom is now the official distributor for Microsoft OEM and FPP software, devices, and services in Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Logicom's agreement with Microsoft has expanded rapidly to include all Gulf countries in under two years, and the company has now added Microsoft-dedicated resources to all its growing local teams. Peter Irinarchos, General Manager of Logicom UAE & Gulf, said of the agreement: "we are very pleased to further expand our regional Microsoft Business to include UAE, Kuwait and Oman. Less than a year ago, we began our OEM business in Qatar, quickly followed by an expansion in Bahrain. To be awarded the OEM and FPP distribution to cover the complete Gulf is a significant recognition of the service and value we provide to our ever growing partner network." Lance Thorp, Consumer Channels Group Lead at Microsoft, explains: "we are pleased to expand our partnership with Logicom in the Gulf region. Logicom has demonstrated a strong commitment towards bringing new business opportunities through excellent logistics, strategic marketing plans and stock availability, increasing Microsoft's reach to our customers and enabling them to achieve more."
The second side of the partnership with Microsoft covers the distribution of Volume Licensing in Palestine through Logicom office in Jordan. With this distribution agreement, Logicom will be able to offer partners in Palestine the full range of Microsoft Volume Licensing Products and Services. Logicom has also committed to bringing added value to its partners with the addition of Microsoft-focused resources to all its growing local teams. Murad Mutawi, General Manager of Logicom Jordan, said of the agreement: "we are very pleased to break new ground and further expand our regional Microsoft Business to include Palestine. We are also extremely proud to have broadened our client base, as this is a key part of our initiative to continuously and dynamically invest in Microsoft Business."

ALSO and Innovix form strategic partnership
                2016-12-02
Broadliner ALSO and Innovix Distribution have agreed on a strategic partnership to bring a wide range of local and global vertical-focused cloud services to SMB and Enterprise customers in South-East Asia and Hong Kong. Both companies are joining forces to make the ALSO Cloud Marketplace platform available to 5,500 of Innovix's channel partners starting in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, with plans to expand further in the region. The partnership provides ALSO with the opportunity to expand services from its catalogue to Innovix's customers. Right from the start, well-known international cloud service providers and local vertical-focused ISVs will have a new platform to offer a broad range of services.
"This partnership is an important milestone for ALSO in our strategic effort to expand business opportunities with our partners in dynamic new regions. We already serve 15 markets in Europe directly and 15 more through our partners in the UK (Westcoast) and the Middle-East (Logicom). Our partnership with Innovix will expand our footprint even further", said Gustavo Möller-Hergt, CEO of ALSO Holding AG.
"Innovix is accelerating its cloud services offering to serve an expanding list of partners, including ISVs, hosters and managed service providers. The strategic partnership with ALSO provides us with a world-class cloud marketplace platform that will enable us to provide exceptional customer experience to our partners. We look forward to working together with ALSO to expand our renowned service and product offerings", said Edmand Cheung, Group Managing Director of Innovix Distribution.

Logicom helps partners and their customers embrace the Cloud through Microsoft CSP program
                2016-09-05
Broadliner Logicom has been appointed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Program for Cyprus, Greece and Malta. The program is designed to strengthen customer relationships and expand cloud sales opportunities by enabling channel partners to provision, bundle, invoice, manage and support Microsoft Cloud offerings including Microsoft Office 365, Azure, Microsoft CRM Online and Windows Intune subscriptions with greater ease and efficiency. Through its participation in the CSP Program, Logicom will offer its partners monthly-based billing subscriptions along with monthly bills for other services, so that partners will receive only a single invoice each month. Logicom will also provide additional value-added services to its partners, including support and migration services. Partners will thus be able to accelerate their sales of Cloud Services by adding value to their own customer base and building their own bundles.
"The Cloud Solution Provider Program puts our partners at the center of the customer relationship", said Phil Sorgen, Corporate Vice President, Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "Through participation, these partners have demonstrated dedication to helping our mutual customers successfully move to the cloud."
Products and Services from the CSP Program will be integrated into the Logicom Cloud Marketplace, expected to roll out by the end of July 2016. The Logicom Cloud Marketplace is a result of Logicom's recent strategic partnership with ALSO Cloud, which offers an advanced cloud solutions environment that will cater for state-of-the-art customer experience. "The appointment of Logicom as a Microsoft CSP provider, enables us to offer advance cloud solutions to our partners and their clients through the Logicom Cloud Marketplace. This is another bold step and investment by Logicom for helping our partners and their clients advance in the new cloud world", said Varnavas Irinarchos, CEO of Logicom.

ALSO and Logicom form cloud partnership to serve Southern Europe and Middle East
                2016-07-22
Broadliners ALSO and Logicom have agreed on a strategic partnership to bring a wide range of local and global cloud-based software services to customers in Southern Europe and the Middle East. Both companies join forces to make the ALSO Cloud Marketplace platform available to over 10,000 Logicom partners in 13 countries, with a potential of 350,000 new seats on the platform: Bahrain, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malta, Oman, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This provides ALSO with the opportunity to offer services from its catalogue to Logicom's customers. Right from the start, well-known international cloud service providers and local ISVs will use the platform to provide a broad range of services.
"This cooperation is an important milestone for ALSO as we pursue promising business opportunities in exciting new regions of the world together with our partners. We already serve 15 markets mainly in Central as well as Northern and Eastern Europe on our own and we are constantly expanding our business", said Gustavo Möller-Hergt, CEO of ALSO Holding AG.
"Logicom is ramping up its cloud solutions offerings for serving its existing as well as new partners including ISVs, hosters and service providers. Our strategic partnership with ALSO provides us with an advanced cloud solutions environment that will cater for state-of-the art customer experience. Together with ALSO we are going to bring great value to our customers for their cloud journeys", said Varnavas Irinarchos, CEO of Logicom Public Ltd. This partnership is the second of its kind, ALSO having signed one similar with British broadliner Westcoast a few weeks ago.
