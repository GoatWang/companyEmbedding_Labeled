Vacuum Feedthrough Repairs

                                    A Ferrotec seal takes advantage of the response of a magnetic fluid to an applied
                                    magnetic field. The basic seal components include ferrofluid, a permanent magnet,
                                    two pole pieces and a magnetically permeable shaft. The magnetic circuit, completed
                                    by the stationary pole pieces and the rotating shaft, concentrates magnetic flux
                                    in the radial gap under each pole piece. When fluid is applied to this gap it assumes
                                    the shape of a liquid O-ring and produces a hermetic seal.  »

                                    of freedom and expansibility. In flexible manufacturing system environment, AGV
                                    can be used to connect many work stations together and perform repetitive tasks

Repurposing Magnetic Fluids to Solve a Need of a Vacuum Feedthrough


Ferrofluid technology first appeared on the technological scene in the 1960’s when a researcher at NASA tried to create a magnetic rocket fuel that could be manipulated under zero gravity by powerful magnets and fed into rocket engines. This concept was abandoned for other alternatives at the time, but the technology was licensed by the earliest founders of what is now Ferrotec Corporation, and since then Ferrotec has been the world leader in magnetic fluid technology, manufacturing and supply. By all modern standards, these first magnetic fluids were crude and would have no practical use in current technologies, but they laid the groundwork for the innovations that were to follow.

Magnetic fluid technology was first licensed by NASA to AVCO Corporation, Wilmington, MA in the 1960’s, under the direction of Dr. Ron Rosensweig. The name ferrofluid was first coined by Rosensweig et al in 1967 in a contract research report funded by NASA. Commercialization of ferrofluids began in 1968 with the founding of Ferrofluidics Corporation by R.E. Rosensweig and R. Moskowitz. The official name for the product was given as ferrofluid. Many possible applications were envisioned for ferrofluids. Loudspeaker technology was one of them, and continues to be one of the largest market segments, going into over 300 million loudspeakers each year at over 300 different companies. Since then, Ferrotec Corporation, formerly Ferrofluidics, has branched out into many areas of ferrofluid technology, becoming a world leader in products for domain detection, material separation and biomedical research, among others.
Ferrotec’s ferrofluid business operates out of our facilities in Bedford, New Hampshire in the United States and in Chiba, Japan.
