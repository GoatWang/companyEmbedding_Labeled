Precision laminating technology is essential for achievingbeautiful and safe display on flat displays

Various types of optical films are used in the display screens of digital products such as LCD monitors, smartphones, tablets, laptop computers, and car navigation systems. These films are essential for providing touch panel functionality, and achieving beautiful, safe display of images, so they play an extremely important role in determining product quality.

superior to conventional concepts and technology
Products called "optical filters" are manufactured by laminating together multiple functional films of different types, and precision laminating technology is critically important due to the complexity and high degree of precision required. Thanks to our superior quality, Fujipream has an overwhelming share in the display device market, which is primarily focused on flat panel displays. 










Difficulty of laminating large-screen flat displays
Today, flat panel displays have replaced CRTs to become the mainstream technology for monitors and televisions, and they are rapidly increasing in size and diversity. As a result, composite functionality has become a requisite for optical filters. Higher precision and technological innovation are in constant demand, from new materials to lamination using complex methods. To achieve a stable supply, in addition to efficiency and cost, yield is an important factor due to the expense of key materials. As a leading company in this field, we have pioneered technologies and know-how for cleanroom management. We meet user needs through high-quality manufacturing and contribute to the evolution of display devices by opening up new possibilities in precision lamination.




An integrated product system centered around "lamination"
for achieving world-class high quality and added value

At Fujipream we carry out the complete process—from material cutting to lamination and assembly—at our own plants. We offer strict quality control, and optimal process selection. 





Commitment to next-generation displays
We are strengthening our ability to handle a diverse range of next-generation display products by applying ultra-precision laminating technology only Fujipream can provide. 




[Large touch panels]
"Direct bonding" to achieve integration of the cover glass and display device
Laminating between hard materials is effective for products such as displays requiring touch panels or cover glass. This enables direct bonding through atmospheric lamination.












[3D displays]
"Stress-free lamination" exploiting outstanding material characteristics
Functional films are evolving in areas such as the medical and amusement markets. By laminating precisely along pixel lines, it is possible to suppress minute deformation caused by lamination, and prevent loss of material characteristics.  





[Small and medium touch panels]
"Multi-panel lamination" for simultaneously laminating multiple films
This lamination is effective for substrates with multiple patterns, as seen with small and medium products. This enables precision lamination on the micron scale of multiple films at one time. 







Processing technology and production equipment for the next-generation
By establishing new processing technologies and developing production equipment, we are further bolstering our capabilities in new fields. 




"Tape attachment lamination" for simultaneously laminating four edges
Laminating between hard materials is effective for products such as displays requiring touch panels or cover glass. This enables direct bonding through atmospheric lamination.









Cutting with alignment function
Cutting equipment with an alignment function enables precision punching out of patterned film. 






Autoclave treatment
Our autoclave treatment equipment can also handle large displays. In the case of small and medium displays, it achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of batches. 








ACF attachment, FPC pressure bonding
FPC pressure bonding is necessary for touch panels. Processing that accompanies lamination can also be performed.







Appearance inspection
Sensory inspection by personnel makes diverse filter inspection over short timeframes possible. We have human resources with extensive experience in the inspection of surface and base materials.

Light-weight Panels Realize Japan's Largest On-roof Solar Plant (page 2)

Facility overview


Cover glass thickness reduced by 75%

If the weight of a solar panel were reduced, the load capacity required to install solar panels could be lowered, and the number of roofs that can be equipped with panels would greatly increase. There would be the possibility of introducing an on-roof-type solar power generation system to buildings and houses on which the owners have, thus far, not been able to mount solar panels because of their poor load capacity. In addition, the density of installation can be raised on the roofs on which the density of solar panels was restricted.

Specifically, many roofs on which the solar panels were installed this time had a load capacity of 20kg/m2 or more. On these roofs, Mitsubishi Electric Corp's existing solar panel, which weighs 21kg per panel or 12.5kg/m2, was installed (Fig. 2). However, some roofs only had a load capacity of 10kg/m2. Due to the load capacity, the existing solar panel weighing 12.5kg/m2 could not be set up on these roofs. Accordingly, Fujipream Corp's solar panel, whose weight was cut by about half to 9.5kg per panel or 6.4kg/m2, was installed on these roofs.

Of the 70,000m2 roofs mounted with solar panels, light-weighted roofs account for about 13,000m2. The 20,906 crystalline silicon solar panels installed consist of 16,226 existing panels by Mitsubishi Electric (about 4MW) and 4,680 light-weight panels by Fujipream (about 1MW).

According to Asahi Glass, some roofs' load capacity was low depending on the purpose of the building, not when the building was constructed. The company had some reasons not to give priority to the load capacity, such as there being no need to attach a crane on the roof and the necessity to quickly complete the building.

The light-weight solar panel uses Asahi Glass' chemically enhanced glass "Leoflex" as cover glass. This product achieved a thickness of 0.8mm, a sharp reduction from the existing model's 3.2mm. The weight was 75% less than that of the existing model. But its features such as the cover glass strength were maintained.

The weight of the cover glass accounts for 70% or more of the overall weight of a crystalline silicon solar panel and, therefore, is a major factor when cutting the weight of a solar panel. Asahi Glass not only supplied glass but also offered other information including that on its optimum usage.

On the other hand, there is the problem that this new glass costs more than the existing cover glass. But the cost is expected to decline as its deployment increases because Leoflex is manufactured by the float process just like glass substrates for LCD panels and it can easily generate a volume-production effect.
