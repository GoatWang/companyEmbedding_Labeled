New Product Launching: Epson Acculaser M1400Thursday, 02 February 2012
	Sebagai distributor produk mesin cetak Epson, tim Epson Synnex Metrodata Indonesia (SMI) mengadakan gathering atas peluncuran produk baru Epson yaitu Epson Acculaser M1400 yang diadakan di Blitz Megaplex, Grand Indonesia, Jakarta (2/2/2012).

	Acara diawali dengan kata sambutan yang disampaikan oleh Andryanto C. Wijaya, Dept Head, Business Product Marketing PT. Epson Indonesia, kemudian dilanjutkan oleh Anwar Hadiyanto, Division Manager SMI.

	Epson Acculaser M1400 merupakan product mainstream dengan user price dibawah 1 juta rupiah. Kelebihan lain yang dimiliki Epson Acculaser M1400 adalah dari sisi teknologinya yang sudah menggunakan teknologi LED, yang menghasilkan pixel dalam hasil cetakannya menjadi lebih rapat. Selain itu, untuk photo cundoctornya tidak consumable, tetapi merupakan bagian dari sparepart sehingga untuk konsumsi pemakaiannya, pengguna hanya mengeluarkan cost di tonernya saja (untuk penggunaan rutin pada tinta), dibanding sebelumnya yakni harus mengganti tinta 2x, sementara photo conductor ganti 1x dengan yang baru. Berapapun penggantian tinta selama photo conductor tidak rusak, maka photo conductor tidak perlu diganti.

	Selain Epson Acculaser M1400, diperkenalkan juga Epson type yang lainnya yaitu produk C1700, C2310DN, MX14, MX14NF.

	Para mitra bisnis juga diberikan Product Update, Solution and Demo oleh Ronny Sasongko, Presales PT. Epson Indonesia dan Program & Promo oleh Kristian Wijaya, Product Marketing Manager SMI. Dalam setiap sesinya juga diadakan sesi tanya jawab yang interaktif.

	Acara pun diakhiri dengan undian doorprize 1 unit BlackBerry Mini dan nonton bareng film Contrabrand.
