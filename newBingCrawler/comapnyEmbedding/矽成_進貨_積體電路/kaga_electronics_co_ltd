Some questions for OEMs to ask electronics services providers
How do you differ from similar, low-cost providers serving identical markets?
How can I be certain our program tooling will be designed to specs?
What IP security do you have to protect my product?
How do you manage cost reductions? How do share ongoing savings?
What alternative to China manufacturing do you offer to enter Asian markets?
Can you reassure me key program personnel won't be pulled elsewhere?
Is all activity performed in-house or do you sub-contract some portions out?
