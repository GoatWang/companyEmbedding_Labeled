SK Hynix Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
2017.07.25



Seoul, July 25, 2017 – SK Hynix Inc. (or ‘the Company’, www.skhynix.com) today announced financial results for its second quarter 2017 ended June 30, 2017. The Company reported its best-ever quarterly revenue, operating profit and net income in two successive quarters.
 
The consolidated second quarter revenue was 6.69 trillion won while the operating profit amounted to 3.05 trillion won and the net income totaled 2.47 trillion won. During the second quarter, favorable market conditions continued to raise memory semiconductor prices. The Company benefited by dealing well with the market situation, elevating its revenue and operating profit by 6% and 24% each compared to the previous quarter.
 
Quarter-over-quarter, DRAM bit shipments increased 3% and the average selling price rose 11%. Both grew up, courtesy of strong demand from a server sector.
 
For NAND Flash, the bit shipments declined 6% but the average selling price rose 8%. The shipment decreased due to sluggish demand growth in smartphones but the ASP could increase thanks to ongoing strong chip prices in every NAND Flash product category.
 
In the latter half, SK Hynix is to consolidate its position in the memory market with the operation of the product portfolio centered on server and mobile applications, which are expected to persistently lead market demands. The Company will expand the mass production volume of a high-end mobile LPDDR4X and also start to mass produce 1Xnm DRAM in the second half as planned.
 
Plus, it will begin to manufacture 3D NAND Flash in a full scale on the upper floor of M14 FAB. Moreover, with its cutting-edge 72-Layer 3D NAND, SK Hynix plans to supply mobile solutions and cSSDs at the end of this year then eSSDs in the next year.


Please note that the financial results discussed herein are preliminary and speak only as of June 30, 2017.  Readers should not assume that this information remains operative at a later time. In addition, this information may include forward-looking statements that involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For further discussion of these risks and uncertainties, readers should refer to SK Hynix Inc.’s filings with the Korea Exchange. This document is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any security of SK Hynix Inc..

SK hynix Inc. () is a South Korean memory semiconductor supplier of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and flash memory chips. Hynix is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker (after Samsung Electronics)[3] and the world's fifth-largest semiconductor company.[4] Founded as Hyundai Electronic Industrial Co., Ltd. in 1983[5] and known as Hyundai Electronics, the company has manufacturing sites in Korea, the United States, China[6] and Taiwan. In 2012, when SK Telecom became its major shareholder, Hynix merged to SK Group[5] (the third largest conglomerate in South Korea). The company's shares are traded on the Korea Stock Exchange, and the Global Depository shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Hynix memory is used by Apple in some of their iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro computers. Apple's A9 chipset is onboard together with a SK Hynix RAM module believed to be "likely the same 2 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM found in the iPhone 6s".[7] Hynix memory is also used by Asus in their Google-branded Nexus 7 tablet (both 2012 and 2013 models, respectively), an OEM provider for IBM System x servers, and is used in desktop PCs and laptops as well as the Asus Eee PC. Dell and Hewlett-Packard (later split as HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise) have also used Hynix memory as OEM equipment.[3] Other products that use Hynix memory include DVD players, cellular phones, set-top boxes, personal digital assistants, networking equipment, and hard disk drives.[8]

1985 Started mass production of 256K DRAM
1986 The Hyundai-manufactured Blue Chip PC was sold in discount and toy stores throughout the US. It is one of the earliest PC clones marketed toward consumers instead of business.[10]
1993 Took over Maxtor (US HDD main factory)
1996 Initial public offering on the Korea Stock Exchange[9]

2002 Sold HYDIS, TFT-LCD Business Unit
2004 Signed System IC Business Transfer Agreement with System Semiconductor
2005 Emerged from Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act ahead of schedule
2006 Posted record the highest revenues since foundation
Established global manufacturing network with complete construction of Hynix-ST Semiconductor Inc.

2009 Company put up for sale by its lenders after it defaulted on loans and a subsequent debt-equity swap
2010 Fine of €51.47 million for illegally fixing prices with eight other memory chip makers.[11]
In January 2010, Hynix Semiconductor Inc was put up for sale in an auction valued at close to $3 billion.[12][13]
On August 31, 2010, HP announced collaboration with Hynix to bring memristor to high volume manufacturing step (targeted for 2013).[14]
2012 SK Group, the third-largest conglomerate in South Korea, acquired a 21.05% stake in Hynix.[15]
2013 Fab 1 and Fab 2 in China both suffered a massive fire which took the factories offline temporarily.[16]
2014 SK Hynix acquired the firmware division of Softeq Development FLLC to make it a part of its global R&D network alongside Italy-based Ideaflash S.r.l, Link_A_Media Devices and Violin Memory in the US, and Taiwanese Innostor Technology.[17][18]
