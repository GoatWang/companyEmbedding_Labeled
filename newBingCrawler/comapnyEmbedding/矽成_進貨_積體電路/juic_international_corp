History[edit]

Before the creation of the company, Jamba Juice was a "senior project" completed by Kirk Perron, an avid cyclist and healthy-lifestyle advocate, at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Jamba Juice was conceived and founded on March 31, 1990 by Perron,[2] who opened his first store in San Luis Obispo, California. He was joined in the business by three friends: Kevin Peters, Joe Vergara, and Linda Ozawa Olds.[3] It was incorporated in 1990 as Juice Club, Inc. in San Luis Obispo.[4][5][6][7]
Jamba Juice acquired all nationwide Zuka Juice, Inc. stores in October 2000.[8] Zuka Juice was founded in Orem, Utah, by Dave Duffin and also was a prominent smoothie company at the time. Since then, Jamba Juice has expanded to become a well known smoothie chain. The first location in New York was at Columbus Circle and 59th Street in the basement of the Time Warner Center and is part of the Whole Foods Market seating area. Other locations include one south of Union Square, Times Square, Tribeca, and one in the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
On August 14, 2003, Jamba Juice agreed to be acquired by Services Acquisition Corp. International for $265 million. A special purpose acquisition company, Services Acquisition is headed by Steven Berrard, former CEO of Blockbuster Inc. Upon the closing of the transaction, the publicly traded Services Acquisition changed its name to Jamba, Inc.[9]
In June 2006, Jamba, Inc. announced that it had completed a $35.0 million convertible preferred stock transaction. The convertible preferred stock becomes redeemable by Jamba, Inc. at the election of the purchasers in June 2016 unless converted earlier and includes an 8% annual dividend. The preferred stock is convertible into common shares at a price of $1.15 per share.
The funding was led by a $19.55 million investment by Mistral Equity Partners, a private equity fund focused on consumer products and services companies, with the remaining $15.45 million investment made by a company controlled by the Serruya Family, a successful entrepreneurial Canadian-based family who founded the Yogen Früz frozen yogurt and smoothie chain. “We are very excited about Jamba and the potential growth opportunities available to the company as it extends the brand through licensing and franchising opportunities,” said Andrew Heyer, managing partner of Mistral Equity Partners. “This transaction complements our focus exclusively on investing in consumer businesses with strong management teams that capitalize on emerging demographic or psychographic trends.”
In December 2008, Jamba began a strategic move to transform the company from a smoothie shop to include a line of wraps, sandwiches, salads, and flatbreads.[10] Jamba currently has over 750 locations in 26 states across the U.S. and a small number of international outlets.
In July 2009, in promoting its new line of products, Jamba Juice was criticized for running an advertising campaign which was described as a "ripoff" of the work of cartoonist David Rees.[11] The ad campaign looked similar to Rees' "Get Your War On" series. Rees was informed of the Jamba Juice ads by a fan who sent in a letter. Rees stated that "Jamba Juice bit my style, with no credit, and it's kind of disrespectful."[11]
In May 2016, Jamba Juice announced the move of its corporate headquarters from Emeryville, California to Frisco, Texas, over a 6-month period and affecting 120 employees, citing the high costs of living and of conducting business in the San Francisco Bay Area.[12][13]
Product range[edit]
In December 2007, it was announced that Jamba would be partnering with Nestlé to lend its name to a line of healthy, ready-to-drink beverages under the Jamba brand; they would offer two different products: smoothies and juices.[14] On December 19, 2008, a press release from Nestle USA and Jamba Juice announced suspension of Jamba ready-to-drink products due to "...challenges...with manufacturing on a consistent basis, resulting in inventory and out-of-stock issues."[15]
In 2014 Jamba Juice launched its expanded Fresh Juice menu, and began making juices blends to order with fresh ingredients such as kale, beets and ginger.

Innovation Bar


On November 16, 2015, Jamba, Inc. announced the construction of their first concept store,[17] called the Jamba Juice Innovation Bar. Located in the center of Old Pasadena, the Innovation Bar replaced their nineteenth store,[16] which was roughly double to triple the size of a typical Jamba Juice store.[16][18] Alongside the usual serving of smoothies, this location also sold many other foods, including quinoa bowls, artisan hummus toast with vegetables, homemade potato chips, and various vegan foods.[16] It was also the first location to house a WiFi-enabled dining area where customers can watch as their beverages are prepared, or meet up with other customers.[19] Matt Kafka, who is the Senior Director of Operations at Jamba, explained it as a "cool and hip place in Southern California".[16] Inside, the customer is greeted with mirrored wall art with photographs of various fruits, a set of television screens showing various motion video greetings, and what Barbara Bestor, the store architect, explains as "contemporary design".[16] Jamba opened the Innovation Bar on July 14, 2016, during a ceremonial ribbon cutting at 10:00 am PDT.[20] In early January 2017, the store was abruptly closed to the public. Jamba has not made any comments relating to the store closure.

History[edit]
The company was founded as Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1971 for $38 million ($224,721,446 today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from Unilever in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed (NASDAQ: RDEN). The company is located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami.[4] The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.
Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were Vendela Kirsebom during the 1980s, Amber Valletta to the mid-1990s, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. On 2 December 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.[5]
Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to Britney Spears fragrances, as well as the Hilary Duff, Elizabeth Taylor and Mariah Carey fragrance collections. Juicy Couture's "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift's fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.[6]
In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on Pinterest, Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.
Sale to Revlon[edit]
In June 2016, US cosmetics company Revlon announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (£611m). When the deal is concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.[7]
On September 7, 2016, Revlon completed its acquisition of Elizabeth Arden. At the time of the merger, it was expected that E. Scott Beattie would join Revlon, Inc.’s board of directors as non-executive Vice Chairman and serve as a senior advisor to Fabian Garcia, Revlon’s President and Chief Executive Officer.[8] [9]
On November 3, 2016, Revlon’s Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Arden’s former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlon’s Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.[10]

The Company

 

StatusHistoryVision




YIANNIS INTERNATIONAL CORP. is an international fruit trade company that deals with fresh fruit import and export, as well as direct sales. The company operates in mainland China and Taiwan, having customers in several primary fruits and vegetables wholesale markets. Every year, a large amount of shipments is delivered by means of Yiannis to various markets of Asia, with numerous types of fresh fruits originating from all continents of the world.

 

The company was formed in early 90’s in Taiwan, focusing mainly on the import of tropical fruits of Thailand to Taiwanese wholesalers. Thanks to the passion and dedication of its members, Yiannis soon developed an intercontinental collaboration network. With the beginning of the new millennium, the company started trades with mainland China through Guangzhou’s Jiangnan Fruit and Vegetable Market, and has expanded to several other provinces and countries since then.

 

In Yiannis, we regard our work as a mission to deliver the highest quality of products to the markets and, in extension, to our customers and end consumers. We believe that the more effort is invested the better results will be achieved. Having accumulated rich knowledge and experience in international trade and fruit markets during the past two decades, our vision is to carry on with the successful hard work and to further thrive in this challenging and ever changing region of Asia.

 – Aristotle (Greek philosopher)

“Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny.”
 – Lao Tzu (Chinese philosopher)


 
 
 
 







Import
For nearly two decades, we have been importing fresh fruits originating from all continents to wholesale markets of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The freshness and quality of the shipments has long been a characteristic attribute of our company.

 
 
 




Export
Besides import, a large variety of renown tropical fruits of Taiwan and Southeast Asia are exported by us to mainland China and Hong Kong markets. Our customers are privileged to enjoy the unique taste of fruits from the best local producers.

 
 
 




Market assessment
The Asian fruit markets are in the nature unique, promising, but also with numerous challenges and peculiarities. Being an intrinsic part of this region, and with firm knowledge accumulated from more than 20 years of experience, we see these highly demanding markets as an opportunity for growth and success.

 
 
 




Sales network

Our main fresh import & export fruits

 
 
 



 

 

 
 


 

 

 
 


 

 

 
 
 








Cherry

Probably the most prestigious product of Yiannis’ fruits fleet. These nice and juicy fresh cherries are making a long way from North and South America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe to their destination in Asian markets!

 

 
 





PLUM

Plum fruit is well-known for its juicy, aromatic, firm and flavorful taste. Plums are produced around the world, and China is the world’s largest producer with over 6 million tonnes annually.

 

 
 





GRAPES

Grapevines have been reported in ancient civilizations and its cultivation can be traced to thousands of years ago. Its cultivars are mainly distinguished by the fruit color into white/green, red/purple and blue/black varieties.

 

 
 





APPLE

Originated from Central Asia, the apple tree has been grown for thousands of years. The largest producer worldwide is China, with the US and Poland following. The 2015/16 annual global trade is forecast to reach 6.7 million tons.

 

 
 





KIWI

Native to North-central and Eastern China, where fruit bearing trees grew in the wild, the national fruit of China has only been commercially cultivated since mid-60s. Italy, Greece, Chile and New Zealand are the leading producers of kiwifruit.

 

 
 





PINEAPPLE

Perhaps the most distinctive tropical fruit! The ananas tree were originally cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs in South America before spreading to tropical countries worldwide.

 

 
 





BLUEBERRY

Apart from cultivation, blueberries are often picked from bushes in the wild. Significant production and export of cultivated blueberries occurs in Canada, U.S., Chile, Australia and New Zealand.

                                    Week in Review July 28, 2017 The major U.S. equity indexes finished mixed for the second week in a row, although this time the Dow registered a gain while the other two finished in the red. The Dow gained 1.2% for the week, closing at an all-time high of 21830. NASDAQ lost 0.2% and the […]

                                    Week in Review July 21, 2017 U.S. stocks and bonds closed mostly higher last week as investors absorbed a bevy of corporate earnings reports and awaited this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, at which the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged for now. Despite a small loss on Friday – which ended its […]

                                    Week in Review July 14, 2017 Stocks had their best week in two months last week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed may not be quick to raise interest rates again in the near future in the light of lower than expected inflation and economic growth.

                                    Week in Review July 7, 2017 A stronger than expected June jobs report pushed stock prices higher on Friday, enough to boost the major indexes into the green for the week. NASDAQ gained 1% on Friday to end the week with a 0.2% gain. The Dow rose 0.4% on the week after rising 0.4% Friday, […]

                                    Week in Review June 30, 2017 Stocks were mostly lower last week but finished the first half of 2017 with strong gains.
