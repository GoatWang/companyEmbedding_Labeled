                    High-Performance 1Gb-8Gb NAND Flash Aims to Accelerate Expansion into the Automotive Market        



 
Thursday, July 20th, 2017 



 
By D.Peter Kim (info@koreaittimes.com) 


HSINCHU, Taiwan, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ Korea IT Times-- Macronix International Co., Ltd. (TSE: 2337), a leading integrated device manufacturer in the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) market, today announced that it has launched its AEC-Q100 Grade 2/3 compliant NAND Flash memory product. With over 27 years of experience and capabilities in semiconductor design and fabrication, Macronix NAND Flash memory has passed all the stringent AEC-Q100 reliability standards, and becomes the first AEC-Q100 full compliant NAND Flash product supplier for Automotive applications.
The Automotive Electronics market has been advancing rapidly, from past applications such as the vehicle's entertainment system, smart dashboards and clusters, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), to new technologies such as smart cars, Internet of Vehicles, and the autonomous car. Extending these trends in the future, each vehicle may resemble an individual artificial intelligence server and the demand for high reliable memory products will increase.
Macronix's newly launched NAND Flash adopts its own patented 36nm semiconductor manufacturing technology that overcomes the short life cycle deficiency of NAND flash, which typically occurs with shrinking semiconductor technology nodes, or technology with multiple bits stored in each cell. Testing results indicate that the more bits stored within a single memory cell, the lower the number of P/E Cycles (program/erase cycles), in addition to decreasing the product's reliability. Nevertheless, with patented manufacturing technologies and reliable circuit design IP (Intellectual property), Macronix's series of NAND Flash memory are very efficient.  The single bit per cell floating gate technology used thereof is not only fast but also reliable, which meets the requirements of high memory capacity, fast transmission rates as well as the highest reliability for automotive use.  In general, Macronix's NAND Flash memory is capable of storing data for at least 10 years or 100,000 programming times, surpassing current JEDEC standards.
Macronix NAND Flash family is offered in 1Gb to 8Gb densities, supporting both SPI and Parallel interface, with operation temperature range from -40°C to +105°C, with significantly improved reliability as compared to the conventional +85°C chip specification currently available in the market. Due to the stringent limitations of NAND Flash memory's temperature compensation and work voltage, the extended operation temperature range of Macronix's Automotive NAND Flash memory provides extra flexibility towards the NAND Flash memory's data retention and full function operation capabilities, giving it a notable advantage in fanless applications, which is becoming increasingly common in space constrained Automotive applications.
In addition, to satisfy various power consumption requirements, Macronix's NAND Flash is offered in both 1.8V and 3V power supply solutions.  Macronix also offers 4-bit ECC and ECC-free solutions to satisfy different specifications and functional requirements.
This series of new products is produced in Macronix's 12-inch Fab (Fab 5) located in the Hsinchu Science Park. The high quality and dependable delivery are two necessary conditions to gain an edge in the Automotive Electronics markets; with its own 12 inch Fab facility, Macronix is able to closely and directly monitor its production capacity and manufacturing progress in real-time, which are the key elements for earning and maintaining customer trust.
Macronix has been the world's largest ROM manufacturer, and in recent years, it has been expanding rapidly in the NOR and NAND Flash memory markets, and is now the largest manufacturer of NOR Flash globally. Macronix's other Automotive Flash memory product lines include Serial NOR Flash and Parallel NOR Flash.
About Macronix 
Macronix, a leading integrated device manufacturer in the non-volatile memory (NVM) market, providing a full range of NOR Flash, NAND Flash, and ROM products.

                     Macronix designs and manufactures 3V, 2.5V and 1.8V Serial NOR Flash products from 512Kb to 2Gb. We also offer backward-compatible, high-performance Serial NOR Flash, MXSMIO® (Multi-I/O) family and MXSMIO® Duplex (DTR) family.
                 







Standard Serial Interface: MX25xxx06 Series

The MX25xxx06 series provides Standard Serial Interface x1 or x2 I/O [Single I/O or Dual I/O] at a single 3V or 2.5V power-supply voltage. These products are offered with 4KB sectors and 64KB blocks.



Default Lock Protection: MX25xxx26 Series

The default lock protection series is optimized for Parameter Protection applications. These products utilize the BP volatile protection bits to protect selected boot areas of memory against misuse of programs, and to erase instructions in the protected area.



MXSMIO®(Multi-I/O): MX25/66xxx33/35/36/39 Series

The MXSMIO® Family provides two kinds of Multi-I/O interfaces: the MX25/66xxx33/35/39 series, which offers a Multi-in / Multi-out interface, and the MX25xxx36 series, which offers a Single-in / Multi-out interface. Both series are available on Quad I/O operation, which quadruples the read performance of systems for high-end consumer applications.



MXSMIO®(Multi-I/O) Duplex (DTR): MX25/66xxx45/85 Series

The MX25xxx45 series offer Quad I/O interface with DTR (Double Transfer Rate) mode operation, featuring the industry’s fastest data transfer rate up to 800MHz.

        To extend MXSMIO® Duplex family I/O selection, we also provide Dual Quad I/O interface with DTR (Double Transfer Rate) mode operation, MX66xxx85 series, featuring data transfer rate of up to 1600MHz. The MXSMIO® Duplex family offers independent block lock protection on the boot sector.



MXSMIO®(Multi-I/O), Quad I/O Permanent Enable: MX25xxx73 Series

The MX25xxx73 series provide Multi-I/O default enable solution. The Multi-I/O interface is available without any setting in Flash side, and it provides user more convenient way to experience the Multi-I/O performance.



Permanent Lock: MX25/66xxx55/56 Series

The MX25/66xxx55/56 series with permanent lock feature provide extreme write protection mechanism. This security feature could permanently set block or sector of a flash to be read only. Our flash memory is available to protect system operation from intentional tampering.

High-Performance 1Gb-8Gb NAND Flash Aims to Accelerate Expansion into the Automotive Market
HSINCHU, Taiwan, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Macronix International Co., Ltd. (TSE: 2337), a leading integrated device manufacturer in the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) market, today announced that it has launched its AEC-Q100 Grade 2/3 compliant NAND Flash memory product. With over 27 years of experience and capabilities in semiconductor design and fabrication, Macronix NAND Flash memory has passed all the stringent AEC-Q100 reliability standards, and becomes the first AEC-Q100 full compliant NAND Flash product supplier for Automotive applications.








The Automotive Electronics market has been advancing rapidly, from past applications such as the vehicle's entertainment system, smart dashboards and clusters, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), to new technologies such as smart cars, Internet of Vehicles, and the autonomous car. Extending these trends in the future, each vehicle may resemble an individual artificial intelligence server and the demand for high reliable memory products will increase.
Macronix's newly launched NAND Flash adopts its own patented 36nm semiconductor manufacturing technology that overcomes the short life cycle deficiency of NAND flash, which typically occurs with shrinking semiconductor technology nodes, or technology with multiple bits stored in each cell. Testing results indicate that the more bits stored within a single memory cell, the lower the number of P/E Cycles (program/erase cycles), in addition to decreasing the product's reliability. Nevertheless, with patented manufacturing technologies and reliable circuit design IP (Intellectual property), Macronix's series of NAND Flash memory are very efficient.  The single bit per cell floating gate technology used thereof is not only fast but also reliable, which meets the requirements of high memory capacity, fast transmission rates as well as the highest reliability for automotive use.  In general, Macronix's NAND Flash memory is capable of storing data for at least 10 years or 100,000 programming times, surpassing current JEDEC standards. 
Macronix NAND Flash family is offered in 1Gb to 8Gb densities, supporting both SPI and Parallel interface, with operation temperature range from -40°C to +105°C, with significantly improved reliability as compared to the conventional +85°C chip specification currently available in the market. Due to the stringent limitations of NAND Flash memory's temperature compensation and work voltage, the extended operation temperature range of Macronix's Automotive NAND Flash memory provides extra flexibility towards the NAND Flash memory's data retention and full function operation capabilities, giving it a notable advantage in fanless applications, which is becoming increasingly common in space constrained Automotive applications.
In addition, to satisfy various power consumption requirements, Macronix's NAND Flash is offered in both 1.8V and 3V power supply solutions.  Macronix also offers 4-bit ECC and ECC-free solutions to satisfy different specifications and functional requirements.
This series of new products is produced in Macronix's 12-inch Fab (Fab 5) located in the Hsinchu Science Park. The high quality and dependable delivery are two necessary conditions to gain an edge in the Automotive Electronics markets; with its own 12 inch Fab facility, Macronix is able to closely and directly monitor its production capacity and manufacturing progress in real-time, which are the key elements for earning and maintaining customer trust.
Macronix has been the world's largest ROM manufacturer, and in recent years, it has been expanding rapidly in the NOR and NAND Flash memory markets, and is now the largest manufacturer of NOR Flash globally. Macronix's other Automotive Flash memory product lines include Serial NOR Flash and Parallel NOR Flash.
