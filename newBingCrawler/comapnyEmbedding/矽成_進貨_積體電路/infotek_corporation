	Company Profile



Altek Corporation was established in 1996, with corporate executive officer Alex Hsia joining force with renowned corporation and major bank. From day one, Altek strived to achieve excellence in the R&D and manufacture of digital camera. At one point, Altek Corporation became one of the world’s top DSC ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) of the world. In the recent years, Altek expanded into the smartphone imaging, medical Imaging, autotronic Imaging, and other new businesses. Over the years, Altek demonstrated its ability as an entrepreneur solution provider for various imaging technologies, as to fulfill its corporate motto: “To deliver innovated imaging solution to help people for a better life.” Year 2013 is the year of transformation for Altek corporation, where businesses in emerging new technologies have achieved fifty-percent of total corporate earnings.
Altek is an international corporation with substantial human and monetary resources abroad and at home. Altek Corporation’s Headquarter is located in Hsinchu Science Park (Taiwan), with its Research & Development Center in Taipei / Neihu (Taiwan) and branch office in Los Angeles, United States. Altek Corporation has a total of NT$2.74 billion in capital. Approval was secured in 2000 to open a global production center in Kunshan, near Shanghai, China. In order to expand manufacturing capability due to increasing orders in the fields of smartphone imaging technology, autotronic technology, medical technology and emerging imaging solutions, Altek has set up a second factory in Kunshan in 2011.

Altek was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) in 2002. Performance in recent years has continued to set records and impress industry watchers. The success of Altek has made it the leader in the image solution industries and number 3 on the annual listing of Taiwan’s top 100 most innovative and competitive technology companies on “Info Tech 100”.。Altek is the first manufacturer in Taiwan to develop digital cameras delivering megapixel quality and resolution. Because digital camera requires thin and delicate features, it is essential to integrate productions of system chips along with other components. Therefore, we have fostered exceptional in-house R&D skills and a solid inventory of proprietary technologies, which has become our core technologies (imaging processing technology, image solution IC and optic technologies). Furthermore, Altek Corporation is always on the lookout for emerging imaging and optical technologies as to better serve its diverse customers and maintain its production edge.Altek is currently the only digital image product design house with an in-house team dedicated to the design and development of core system chips. Self-designed application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) deliver the qualitative differences that place us solidly ahead of competitors. Exceptional control of product development processes and unmatched expertise in integrating into products a wide range of popular functions helps us respond quickly to market demand and leverage fully our competitive strengths.Over a decade of experience in researching and developing digital camera products give Altek significant depth in every aspect of our products. In addition to chip design, we have expertise in electro-mechanical systems integration, software design, optoelectronics, precision mechanisms and product casing and industrial design work. Always striving for improvements, we will increasingly leverage the advantages of our vertically-integrated subsidiaries to extend competitive advantages in R&D further into the realms of production and manufacturing.To grow with the ever-changing market, Altek has not only set its eyes on the viewing market, but also the sensing market. With its core technology and vertical integration tactic, Altek is equipped to provide one-stop-shop solution to its customers.Since 2006, Altek has worked to diversify its product offering into fields such as automobile electronics, GPS and medical. In the few years that Altek has penetrated into the field of automobile electronics, we have successfully developed a series of “Advanced Driver Assistance Systems”, including: “Eagle View System”, back-up-view camera, etc., and won license to be an OEM for automobile production. From consumer electronics to automotive technology, Altek has proved its competitive edge with its core imaging technology and business model.In 2008, Altek started research and development of medical-related imaging solution products. As a result, Altek released its first glucometer product in 2011. Fulfilling the highest standards of safety and stability, Altek’s products have successfully entered the next level of sophistication. Altek is also the only corporation in Taiwan that has the abilities to develop consumer electronics and medical technology. A milestone in Altek product development, these products signal the start of a strategic initiative to integrate more functions into digital imaging products; delivering practical, useful products to customers and transforming Altek into a market-oriented solutions provider.Ever since its establishment, Altek has worked towards mobile phone’s imaging solutions, and invested heavily in developing related technologies and products. From early on, we have plotted our moves and overcame our obstacles and persisted on the path of mobile phone’s imaging solutions. In 2013, Altek successfully entered the smartphone’s market and provided imaging solutions (Single camera module, Dual camera module, Altek Image Signal Processor(ISP) and software) and higher profits for major smartphone providers.
