Company Description                    




                        Zentel Electronics Corp. was established by Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. (PSC) in December 2002 to enrich its product portfolio by designing dynamic random access memory (DRAM) using its advanced fabrication process technology. The products designed by Zentel were licensed to PSC for its manufacturing and sales to the computation and consumer electronics market. Its product portfolio covers SDRAM, DDR-1, DDR-2, GDDR and mobile SDR/DDR, from 64Mb to 512Mb. The applications include hard drives, ADSL routers, cable modems, digital cameras, digital TV, set top box, and many others in the consumer electronics, computer peripheral and communication areas. Starting 2006, PSC has decided to focus on manufacturing and foundry business, and Zentel has assumed the business owner of consumer DRAM and started to market the products with Zentel logo. The company launched IPO in TWSE in October 2008 and passed the certification of ISO9001:2008 and ISO14001:2004 in March 2009. Zentel has its headquarters in Hsin Chu Science Park and a design center located in Amagasaki Japan. Combing the multi-national design talents and strong support from PSC, Zentel stands out as the consumer DRAM supplier with a comprehensive product lineup utilizing most advanced technology.

Zentel rounds up SDRAM portfolio with 4Gb DDR3(L)
Zentel Electronics Corp. announces the availability of a new series of 4 Gigabit-DDR3-SDRAMs also with a low power option in the commercial temperature range (0..+95°C). The low power version, with a typical 1.35V supply voltage, is backward compatible with the basic version with typical 1.5V supply if timing parameters are adjusted appropriately. All versions are available for effective internal clock rates up to 1600 MHz in the FBGA78 package with 8 bit I/O configuration as A3T4GF30ABF or in the FBGA96 package with 16 bit I/O configuration as A3T4GF40ABF. This opens up applications such as high resolution digital video as well as high resolution display or imaging solutions in  signal acquisition or processing with increased demand in high speed data communication or the integration in mobile systems.
