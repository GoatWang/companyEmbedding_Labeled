NXP’s Microcontroller Business Reinforces Market Commitment with Extended Product Longevity of Key LPC Products







NXP's Microcontroller Business Reinforces Market Commitment with Extended Product Longevity of Key LPC Products

NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI), today announced it will extend the longevity of LPC1700 and LPC2000 microcontrollers (MCU) by an additional five years in response to the continued demand and broad market usage of these products.


More than a decade ago, NXP laid the foundation for today's MCU market with the introduction of the industry's first truly integrated flash MCU, based on ARM technology - the LPC2106. By combining the ARM7TDMI-S processor with on-chip FLASH, SRAM, general purpose peripherals in a low pin-count package, the LPC2106, followed quickly by LPC2138 and LPC2148 MCUs, set the stage for what eventually turned into hundreds of breakthrough MCU devices from NXP.


'NXP has maintained its leadership because we understand behind every embedded application are engineers that need a trusted supplier,' said Geoff Lees, senior vice president and general manager of the Microcontroller Business Line at NXP, 'Commitment to longevity, ongoing investment and local support is critical to this trust, which is why we are extending the longevity of two of the world's most popular ARM-based MCU series.'


Building on our history of innovation - to include flash-less MCUs that execute in place from external memory, expanding with ARM Cortex-M-based devices, and now providing integrated security, protection, and a range of options including ultra-low power to high performance - NXP has always found a way to differentiate its products in market.


'We have long been a partner to NXP's LPC microcontroller portfolio,' said George Zhou, founder of Guangzhou ZLG MCU Technology Co., Ltd. 'We appreciate their commitment to longevity, but it is their unwavering focus on breakthrough innovations that reassures my company is aligned with the market leader.'


'We're proud of our accomplishments thus far and this just sets the stage for more to come,' said Lees. 'Most exciting is our unique scale - from microcontrollers to microprocessors - enabling us to deliver the latest advances in ultra-low power process technology and design. This is further strengthened by our comprehensive software and solutions offering that help make up NXP's powerhouse portfolio, ensuring our customers are always in a position to solve ever more challenging problems.'
