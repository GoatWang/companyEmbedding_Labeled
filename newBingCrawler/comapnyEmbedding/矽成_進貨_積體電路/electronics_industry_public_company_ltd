Chin Nan is just right for you. We are an experienced RF product supplier for decades, and our wide product range can offer you one-stop-shopping.



 2.92mmChin Nan 2.92mm connectors are precision connectors for microwave applications up to 40GHz. Optimum results are achieved with the use of a 2.92mm outer conductor diameter and air dielectric. Chin Nan 2.92mm series is mechanically compatible with SMA and 3.5mm connector series.

 SMPMThe SMPM connector is a blind-made connector by push-on connection. Its size is about 70% smaller than standard SMP connectors. SMPM connectors are mainly used in high-packaging-density and tight-spaced applications. It has high reliability and excellent electronic performance from DC to 65GHz.

 HERMETIC CONNECTORSChin Nan hermetic connectors are designed for use in harsh application environments.  The sealing (helium leak) rate for our hermetic connectors can achieved to 1X10-8 cc/sec.News and Eventselectronica 2016
