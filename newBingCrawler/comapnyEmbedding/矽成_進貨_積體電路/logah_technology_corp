You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Research and Markets has exceptional standards in terms of customer service. Stephen was my contact since

                         an initial enquiry last October. He never failed to reply promptly and efficiently. The information provided has always been clear and to the point. This quality of service extends to Thomas at the Orders Department. I will be happy to order publications from Research and Markets again if the situation arises.
