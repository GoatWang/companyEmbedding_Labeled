  The S5L8030B also includes the following components: a 16-bit MCU with 24-bit 
  audio DSP coprocessor, 4-channel timers, I/O ports, audio PWM processor, 1-channel 
  UARTs, SPI, and PLLs for clock generation. Especially, The S5L8030B micro-architecture 
  makes the solution more cost effective.

  The CalmADM3 is a cost effective MCU+DSP solution based on Samsung's 16-bit 
  MCU (CalmRISC16) and 24-bit audio DSP (CalmMAC24), which is conducting system 
  management and high quality audio processing like decoding MP3 and WMA.
