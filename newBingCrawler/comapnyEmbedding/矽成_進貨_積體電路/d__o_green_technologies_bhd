This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on September 23, 2015.
D&O Green Technologies Bhd (+ve)
SHARES of LED-manufacturer D&O Green Technologies Bhd (Fundamental: 0.75/3, Valuation: 0.60/3) surged 16.4% on heavy volume to close at 35.5 sen last Friday.
For 1H2015 ended June, profits surged to RM4.5 million compared to a loss of RM0.1 million from a year earlier. This was despite a 9% drop in revenues to RM204 million. The improved performance was attributed to the stronger US dollar and shift towards higher margin products. 
Although the company appears to be turning around, investors should note that its 68.7%-owned subsidiary, Dominant Opto Technologies Sdn Bhd, lost a court case on Aug 28, 2015. As a result it has to pay RM21.7 million to the plaintiff, Geepar Enterprise Sdn Bhd. 
D&O estimates that this ruling, which it intends to appeal, will cause its FY2015 earnings and net asset per share to drop by 0.85 sen. This is nearly double the company’s current half-year earnings.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
