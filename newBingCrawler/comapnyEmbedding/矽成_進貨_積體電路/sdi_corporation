Samsung SDI Completes EV Battery Plant Construction in Hun..
 ◇ Starts production of high-power and high-efficiency batteries designed using state-of-art technology… Early completion from second half to second quarter of 2018◇ Innovative construction methods used to build cutting-edge line and meet European customer needs betterSEOUL, South Korea--Samsung SDI (President: Jun Young-hyun) hosted a completion ceremony for the state-of-art electric vehicle (EV) battery plant scheduled to open in second quarter of 2018 in Hungary.Samsung SDI celebrated the completion of construction of its EV battery plant in Goed, 30 kilometers north of Budapest, Hungary, on May 29 (Hungarian time). The ceremony was attended by about 150 officials, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Samsung SDI President Jun Young-hyun, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto and Korean Ambassador to Hungary Yim Geun-hyeong. Sitting on a 330,000 square-meter site in Goed, the plant is capable of producing batteries for 50,000 electric vehicles annually with operations expected to begin in the second quarter of next year. The company will be able to not only save logistics costs, but also improve customer service in Europe. Samsung SDI’s former plasma display panel (PDP) plant has been transformed into a plant equipped with state-of-art technology of Samsung SDI to produce high-power and high-efficiency EV batteries. Through construction of Hungary plant, Samsung SDI sets up a global electric vehicle batteries production tripod with plants in Ulsan, South Korea and Xian, China.Europe is leading the global EV market with its environment-friendly policy. The market for batteries, one of core parts of electric vehicles, is expanding fast alongside the EV market. “For the first time, state-of-the-art technology of Samsung SDI will be applied to batteries to be made in this plant in Hungary. Batteries are one of the most important parts supplied to global car makers. I expect the plant to contribute much to the growth of the European electric vehicle market,” Samsung SDI President Jun Young-hyun said.​​ ​

Samsung SDI Launches New Lineup of High-capacity and High-..
 ◇ The Company Debuted High-capacity E2 Model, and High-power P3 Model at Energy Storage Europe 2017◇ Showcased High-volt Residential ESS, a Perfect Alternative to Lead-acid BatteriesSEOUL, South Korea--Samsung SDI (KRX:006400) launched its new ESS products that adopted innovative design technology.   Samsung SDI presented new lineup of its comprehensive ESS solutions at the Energy Storage Europe 2017, an international exhibition held for three days from March 14, 2017 in Dusseldorf, Germany.      Being an exhibition dedicated to ESS batteries and renewable energies, the Energy Storage Europe 2017 was taken part by more than 100 companies in ESS-related front and rear industries from around 50 countries, including major ESS companies such as ABB, Siemens and Younicos that have operations in Europe and Global Market.      The company showcased new ESS products at the exhibition, high-capacity E2 and high-power P3 models, whose energy density is sharply increased.E2 model is a high-capacity ESS battery that substantially increased the number of cells integrated in the container by adopting innovative design technology. Samsung SDI dramatically raised intensity of space in the ESS container by upgrading module design and rack arrangement technology.The company designed a compact module by reducing its size from 42 liter to 35 liter, while configuring it to increase the number of integrated cells in the module by 10% from 20 in previous modules to 22 cells. Its design is innovated to integrate larger number of cells in a smaller space. And the container is designed to enclose larger number of ESS modules by adopting a new rack arrangement method that removed passages in the ESS container. The company prevented any problem in managing ESS by adopting improved cooling technology and installing gates on both sides of the container while removing passages.         As a result, E2 model realized the high-capacity ESS battery by enclosing the capacity of 9.1MWh in the container, nearly twice larger than previous products.  E2 model is developed targeting utility ESS market that requires large capacity. Needed for storing energy during low-demand hours and using it in high-demand hours, utility ESS batteries are widely used in recent years in connection with renewable energies such as solar photovoltaic power and wind power. As a utility ESS with larger capacity can store more energy, it can supply energy to larger number of facilities.    Samsung SDI also unveiled P3, a further upgraded high-power model. P3 is designed to maintain high-power for longer time by using 78Ah high-power and high energy density cells with 15% increased capacity without changing the size of 68Ah battery cells adopted for previous models. P3 model can be used for power stabilization that requires high-power ESS. An ESS for power stabilization plays the role of stabilizing quality of power at the substation by maintaining power of the generator at a certain value. ESS allows supplying high quality power by storing power when it exceeds standard value and discharging power when it is in shortage. And when power is insufficient, it needs high-power ESS that can supplement strong energy in an instant.     The common feature of E2 and P3 is that their energy density is improved by increasing capacity while retaining the size of previous ESS containers. ESSs with increased energy density can save construction and facility management costs by reducing scale of ESS facilities. Eventually, this will lead to reduction in investment on the part of customers.  In addition, Samsung SDI displayed two new residential ESS modules. One of them is an advanced lithium-ion ESS battery that can replace previous lead-acid battery by adopting a technology of delivering 48V, the same voltage as the lead-acid battery. The other is an ESS product that can reduce cost of ESS system by providing high voltage.  “The new lineup further sharpens competitive edge of our ESS products. We will lead the world market by developing advanced ESS technologies ahead of others,” said Sewoong Park, vice president for ESS Team, Samsung SDI.Navigant Research expects that the world ESS market will grow by around 50% to 4.3GWh in this year, and sharply increase by around 60% annually by 2020 to 14.8GWh. In its report on the world ESS market for 2015, B3, a market research institution, announced that Samsung SDI ranked first in the market by taking 18% of its share.  ​

Very Special Korean Experience by Employees of Samsung SDI..
 ◇ Hungarian employees who are currently receiving battery facility training at Ulsan Plan went to experience traditional Korean culture such as Korean archery, rice cake soup, traditional clothes, and ancient palaces during the Lunar New Year holiday.◇ Hungary Office, founded in 2001, is the foothold for Samsung SDI’s expansion into the European market. Beginning with the production of Braun tube in 2001, the Hungarian plant manufactured PDP in 2007 and batteries in 2018.◇ Employees who worked when the plant manufactured PDP returned to work for the renewed plant now producing batteries.◇ CEO Cho Nam Seong encouraged the employees to have “a healthy sense of crisis and passion about our future vision.​​Employees from Samsung SDI Hungary Experience Korean Culture Hungarian employees working at the Samsung SDI’s local outpost in Europe, who are currently in training in Korea, went to experience traditional Korean culture. The employees come from Hungary, a country that was selected as the European hub for Samsung SDI’s main business of automobile battery manufacturing. They are currently being trained to operate battery manufacturing facilities. These workers who are new to Korea went on an excursion to Jongno in Seoul for the Lunar New Year’s Day on the weekend to visit Hwanghakjeong Traditional Archery Museum and Gyeongbokgung Palace and experience Korean traditional culture. The employees hopped on KTX, a bullet train, from Ulsan to arrive at Seoul. They then were transported to Hwanghakjeong Traditional Archery Museum located in Sajik-dong, Jongno-gu. The Hungarian employees continued to shift their position while sitting on the floor, clearly unfamiliar with the Korean culture of sitting on the floor. “Hungary also has a tradition of archery. We used to be a country with a strength in horseback riding archery. I like ancient weapons, and it’s a great pleasure to view and make traditional Korean bows here,” said Mr. George, who showed the most interest in the bow making activity.After the employees shot several arrows at the shooting range in Hwanghakjeong with the bows they made, they visited a restaurant in Gwanghwamun Gate area to try traditional foods such as rice cake soup and noodles. The Hungarian employees, who have been in training at Ulsan Plant for three months, used chopsticks proficiently to eat the rice cake soup.  “In Hungary, we don’t eat chicken or duck dish because we are afraid of fortune flying away. Instead, we eat dishes made with lentils, because the beans remind us of money, people believe that they will bring wealth. Another food we eat at New Year’s is young pork meat because it is thought to bring fortune,” said Mr. Daniel who says his new year’s resolution is to quit smoking. The Hungarians talked about their hopes for the new year as they ate the rice cake soup.  As the last stop of the excursion, the employees visited Gyeongbokgung Palace in traditional Korean clothes. Some even wore gat, a traditional broad-brimmed hat, and made a traditional pigtail hairdo, in addition to beautiful Korean clothes, to which they expressed much satisfaction. Ms. Bernedette, the only woman to participate in the event on the day, said that she came to respect the Korean traditional fashion which is so beautiful, and wearing the clothes made her love the clothes even more. After taking a look around the palace, the employees gathered in front of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion to share their feelings about the excursion. They also showed a great enthusiasm for the start of working at Samsung SDI Hungary in the new year. Mr. Chuber said, “Today’s experience was very special. I felt that the foundational mission of Hwanghakjeong, in particular, was relevant to our situation because we are preparing for the new start of the Hungary Plant.” He also asked other Korean participants to provide much emotional support for the Hungarian Office of the company in the new year. Hwanghakjeong, the place the employees visited first during this excursion, was founded by Korean Emperor Gojong in the late 19th century to pass down the art of traditional archery, which was on the course of being forgotten. The name of the pavilion means, “Bull’s-eye can be hit when the archer has good intentions inside and upright body on the outside.” It is a place that harbors the dreams of Emperor Gojong who dreamt of his country’s revival by setting himself upright and practicing archery. The five Hungarian employees returned to Ulsan after the series of activities, and pledged to contribute to the new beginning of Samsung SDI Hungary. ​    Hungarian Employees Who Led the Golden Age of PDP Come to Ulsan Plant At the beginning of the new year, a group of foreign employees are eagerly learning the operation of battery manufacturing facilities at Samsung SDI’s Ulsan Plant. These are employees from the company’s Hungary Plant, dispatched to Ulsan, Korea from November of last year until February of this year to learning how to set up a battery plant in Hungary. The Hungary Plant of Samsung SDI was first established in 2001, beginning Braun tube production in 2002 and transformed into a PDP manufacturing plant in 2007. For the next seven years, the factory produced PDP modules before ceasing production due to the advent of LCD and OLED technologies in 2013. In August 2016, Samsung SDI selected the site of Hungary Plant as the hub for manufacturing automobile batteries that will give the company a foothold in the European market. Hungary Plant is in the process of being set up, with the preparation of employee training and facility installations for the kick-start in later half of 2018. “Most of us have not lived in a dormitory before, and we were most shocked by the communal showers, which was difficult to get used to,” said a Hungarian employee being trained at Ulsan, laughing and talking about this culture shock.  It is newsworthy that these Hungarian employees came all the way to Korea to learn battery manufacturing process, but what is more special is that some of the visitors are making a renewed relationship with Samsung SDI. After its announcement in August 2016 that the Hungary PDP Plant will be renovated to manufacture automobile batteries, the company employees 97 people, 39 of whom used to work at Braun tube and PDP production line in the same factory. A returning employee cited the bright future prospect of the business to explain why he came back, saying: “Europe has a growing interest in eco-friendly vehicles, with a high possibility of growing electric vehicle market. I was looking at this new prospect in the market when I came across the news that Samsung SDI was repurposing the old factory into a battery plant and that new jobs were available there. That is why I returned.  Kovacs Zsuzsanna, who worked on Braun tube and PDP manufacturing from 2003 to 2008, feels much more specially attached to Samsung SDI, because she met her fiancé while working at the company. She fondly remembers her long time at the company for kind and good colleagues with whom she collaborated. She says that Samsung SDI “is a good working place with an excellent working environment.” Most of all, to Ms. Zsuzsanna, the company is especially special because she met her fiancé there. She said, “I am daunted by doing something new in automobile battery, but I am very happy because I can be with the company working on an industry with an infinite possibility.” Bolla David Sandor, who worked for Samsung SDI for ten years until its Hungary Plant ceased PDP operations in 2014, worked with Samsung Electronics Hungary Office after he parted with the manufacturing plant. He came back after hearing the news that the manufacturing plant will begin again as an automobile production plant. About why he came back to Samsung SDI from Samsung Electronics, Mr. Sandor said, “Samsung SDI, where I worked for ten years, is like a home for me. Although automobile is an industry that I had not experienced before, I wanted to nurture professionalism in a new promising area. I want to improve the company with my know-hows from various experiences from the past.” Karosi Laszlo, who worked in a facility technology department of Hungary Plant from 2002 to 2014, said, “I always had challenging goals because I began working from the setup of the factory. I enjoyed my work, which never ceased to change without staying stagnant.” Mr. Lazlo worked for a French automobile company after separating with Samsung SDI in 2014, said that he returned to his old company because of good memories there, and that he would like to work with his colleagues like those days when the factory manufactured PDP modules. The Hungarian employees are to finish training in mid-February, and return home to begin working on setting up the facilities at the renewed Hungary Plant. During the first half of this year the facilities will be ready, and in the later half it will begin the preparations for manufacturing to commence supply automobile batteries for the European market within this year. Samsung SDI CEO Cho Nam Seong visited the Ulsan Plant on January 12 to meet with the Hungarian employees receiving training. There, Mr. Cho said that the company chose Hungary Plant for battery production because of the outstanding record of labor-management relationship and excellent manufacturing competitiveness. He also explained that the Hungary Plant will be the foundation for Samsung SDI’s expansion into the European automobile market. Later, he urged the employees to have a healthy sense of crisis for the future vision and continue on in one direction together, also promising to continue to increase opportunities to communicate with employees.  ​
