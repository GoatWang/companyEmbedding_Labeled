                Hanyang Digitech has started its business independently on April 19th of 2004 after a spin-off from Hanyang ENG to specialize in manufacturing with world's best technology and to actively prepare for fast-changing economic conditions.

Hanyang Digitech is composed of three divisions (Module, Mobile, IP communication), and each division is promoting introduction of new technologies and R&D.

Hanyang Digitech shares technologies with Samsung in manufacturing Dram Memory Module which includes electrical quality test and wrapping. Hanyang Digitech also manufactures car DVD player and VoIP Modem which enables transferring sound and visual data through internet connection.

Hanyang Digitech obtained ISO9001 certification in August 1997, Single PPM in November 1998, and ISO14001 in July 1998 to produce better products with identical quality. Hanyang Digitech is trying to obtain OHSAS18001 in November to meet customers' need for a safe construction site.
