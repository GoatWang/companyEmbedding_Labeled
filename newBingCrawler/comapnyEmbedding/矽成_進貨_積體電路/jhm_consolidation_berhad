JHM Consolidation Bhd
(June 9, RM5.50)
Change to neutral with a higher target price (TP) of RM4.92: We change our recommendation to “neutral” for JHM Consolidation Bhd with a higher TP of RM4.92 (ex-bonus TP: RM2.46) based on a revised target price-earnings ratio multiple of 24 times, consistent with the target valuation of the Malaysian tech sector. The sector (and the stock) has been rerated substantially since the beginning of this year amid positive industry data and positive sentiments lifting valuations. The stock has performed well, with its share price considerably exceeding our upgraded TP of RM3.33 in March. Following aggressive rallies, we believe JHM’s current valuation has broadly priced in near-term growth prospects.
We continue to like JHM, given favourable demand in the global automotive LED lighting market, its penetration into other LED applications (for examples, the aerospace industry, professional architectural lighting and horticultural lighting), barriers to entry due to a tough qualification process, and a hands-on management team. Nevertheless, we are mindful of: i) unfavourable currency movements; ii) competition; iii) volatility in orders versus expectations; and iv) dependence on major automotive customers in the US where vehicle sales may be levelling off. We are keeping our earnings estimates largely unchanged.
Stripping off exceptional items, JHM registered a net income of RM7.1 million (+66.2% year-on-year, +20.7% quarter-on-quarter) for the first quarter of financial year 2017 (1QFY17). Earnings were broadly in line with our expectations, accounting for about 28% of our full-year projection. The solid quarterly results, as reported in the annual report 2016, were mainly due to higher contributions from favourable demand conditions for automotive LED lighting as well as industrial products and a new product mix with higher average selling prices launched in 4QFY16. Margins were slightly lower than in the previous quarter by 3% due to higher administrative expenses incurred during the period. — Inter-Pacific Research, June 9

Company Announcement Archive Availability Update:
Bursa Malaysia had on 20 April 2015 replaced the announcement dissemination system known as Bursa LINK. As we have over 1 million records of announcements made by listed issuers over a span of 15 years, the data migration and verification has to be carried out progressively to ensure data integrity and reliability. During the initial period of migration, only announcements for a period of 5 years from 1 January 2010 are made available on the website. Thereafter, the remaining past announcements on Bursa Malaysia website will be progressively increased to 15 years within 3 months from 20 April 2015.
