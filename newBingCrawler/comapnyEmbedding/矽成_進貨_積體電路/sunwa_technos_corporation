I was looking everywhere with no luck for an important research publication called World Retail Data

                         & Statistics 2014. Eventually, I gave up but found a 2012 edition of the same publication at Research and Markets. I then emailed customer support to see if they could get me the 2014 edition and within hours, I had the 2014 edition - even at no additional charge.Wow, that was truly impressive customer service by you guys.Thanks a ton to Research and Markets.
