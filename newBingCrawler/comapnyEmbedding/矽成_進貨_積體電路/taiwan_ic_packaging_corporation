King Yuan Electronics Corp. (KYEC) is the largest professional tester of back-end integrated circuit (IC) packaging and conducts testing for the semiconductor industry worldwide.
Founded in May 1987, KYEC has become a leading testing company in upstream and downstream IC design, manufacturing, packaging, and testing in the global semiconductor industry. The headquarters of KYEC is located near the Gongdaowu Rd., in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The primary production factory is situated in Miaoli County.
The KYEC subsidiaries King Long Technology and Zhen Kun Technology are situated in the Suzhou Industrial Park in China. Both subsidiaries package and test semiconductor products and serve as the production and marketing bases of KYEC in China, providing immediate services to the Chinese market. KYEC also established regional offices in North America, Japan, Europe, and Singapore to provide immediate business services for customers worldwide.
The factory area of KYEC in Taiwan is approximately 108,000 m2. The floor area of the factory is approximately 316,000 m2. The clean room area is 126,000 m2. The factory area and clean room area in Suzhou are 44,561 m2 and 10,223 m2, respectively. The total production capacity of wafer probing is approximately 460,000 pieces per month. The final test amount of IC products reaches 600 million pieces per month. At the end of 2013, the total assets value of KYEC was approximately NTD37.3 billion. This large-scale professional testing operation has caused KYEC to become an international semiconductor product tester.
KYEC provides packaging and testing services in the back-end process of semiconductor production globally. The provided testing services include wafer probing (approximately 43%), final testing (approximately 50%), and preassembly services (approximately 7%). The production line covers memory, logic and mixed-signal, system on chip, contact image sensor/charge-coupled device, liquid crystal display driver, radio frequency/wireless, and microelectromechanical system test solutions. KYEC has over 2000 test platforms in total. KYEC provides packaging services for thin small outline packages, small outline packages, complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensors, quad-flat no-leads packages (radio frequency), land grid arrays/system-in-package (radio frequency), chip-scale packages, and memory cards.
The ratio of overseas KYEC customers has increased annually to 49%. The primary customer groups are fabless firms (approximately 76%), foundry firms (approximately 2%), and other integrated device manufacturers (approximately 22%). As the world’s largest professional IC tester, KYEC has received certificates and orders from leading manufacturers in various markets, such as those for mobile phones, wireless communication, liquid crystal display driver ICs, graphics cards, special dynamic random access memory, NOR flash, ICs for consumer electronics, and microelectromechanical systems. Consequently, KYEC’s revenue grows rapidly, creating new high records in corporate performance and gradually stabilizing the production line structure.
Quality, delivery, engineering support, technology, and the provision of costs and prices that enhance competitiveness have been the consistent focus of KYEC. The major competitive advantages of KYEC originate from automated devices, improved performance, customized testing machine components, test platform conversion and development, and the ability to commit to consistent investment in device requirements by customers. The competitiveness of KYEC is increasing and the company becomes increasingly secure over time.
Performance, innovation, excellence, and sharing are the core values of KYEC. With approximately 6000 talented personnel worldwide, KYEC has become a leading global enterprise that provides professional outsourced IC testing. KYEC has earned numerous awards for providing a harmonious employee-employer relationship and friendliness to local communities. KYEC intends to become the closest partner of upstream and downstream customers in the global semiconductor industry and establish the benchmark for the IC packaging and testing service industry globally.
