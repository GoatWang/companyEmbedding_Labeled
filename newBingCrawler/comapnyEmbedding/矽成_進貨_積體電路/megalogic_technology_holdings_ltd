Company Description                    




                        The Company and its subsidiaries is specialised in the provision of integrated circuit solutions and is principally engaged in the design, development and sales of integrated circuits. Currently it outsources the production process to specialist semiconductor subcontractors,namely wafer foundries (commonly known as ‘‘fabs’’), wafer testing houses and IC packaging factories. The Group has its own engineering expertise to develop intellectual properties for IC solutions, as well as testing software and tools to ensure product quality. It is neither an OEM nor an ODM as it does not have production facility to carry out manufacturing activities. It sells IC under its own brand name ‘‘MiniLogic’’ and provides ASIC Service in design and development of tailor-made IC to its customers.
