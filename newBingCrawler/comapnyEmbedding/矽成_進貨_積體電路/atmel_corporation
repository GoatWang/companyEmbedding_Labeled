What’s New in Atmel Studio 7
Say hello to a cleaner, more modern user interface.
Atmel® Studio 7 has been updated to use the 2015 version of the Visual Studio Shell, enhancing not only the look and feel of the integrated development environment (IDE) but also the performance when working with large projects. An improved Help system enables better integration of Atmel documentation in the online as well as the offline help systems. The start page has been revamped to always contain relevant and up-to-date information on the devices you are using to create designs. An updated Visual Assist plug-in included free in Atmel Studio also brings several improvements and productivity enhancements to the editor.

Low-power Application Design Has Never Been Easier
The Atmel Data Visualizer plug-in now captures and displays run-time power data from your application when used with the Atmel Power debugger, or a supported Xplained-PRO board. You can now profile the power usage of your application as part of a standard debug session. Sampling the program counter during power measurements makes it possible to correlate power spikes with the code that caused them. 
From Makerspace to Marketplace — Enabling a Seamless Transition to Production-ready Tools
Atmel Studio 7 features seamless one-click import of projects created in the Arduino development environment. Your sketch, including any libraries it references, will be imported into Studio 7 as a C++ project. Once imported, you can leverage the full capabilities of Studio 7 to fine-tune and debug your design. Atmel Studio 7 fully supports the powerful embedded debugger on the Arduino Zero board. For other Arduino boards, shield-adapters that expose debug connectors are available, or switch to one of the many available Xplained-Mini/PRO boards to fully leverage the Atmel HW eco-system. Regardless of what you choose, you will surely make something amazing.


Device-Specific Help at the Touch of a Button
The Help system in Atmel Studio 7 has been extended to support on-line as well as off-line access, meaning that you will always get the latest documentation when you are connected, and that it will stay with you when you are mobile. Device aware context sensitivity and an IO-view have been added to the editor, allowing you to look up register-specific information from the datasheet of the part you are using without leaving the editor. The AVR-Libc documentation further enhances the context sensitive Help system, allowing you to look up function definitions easier than ever before.
Studio 7 is the preferred IDP for developing and debugging all AVR and Atmel ǀ SMART applications. It gives you a seamless and easy-to-use environment to write, build and debug your applications written in C/C++ or assembly code.

 

    More than 1600 ready-to-use project examples
  Atmel Studio 7 is free of charge and is integrated with the Atmel Software Framework (ASF)—a large library of free source code with 1,600 project examples. ASF strengthens Atmel Studio by providing, in the same environment, access to ready-to-use code that minimizes much of the low-level design required for projects. Standard IDEs are suited for creating new software for an MCU project. In addition to this, the Atmel Studio 7 IDP also:
					Facilitates reuse of existing software and, by doing so, enables design differentiation.Supports the product development process with easy access to integrated tools and software extensions through Atmel Gallery.Reduces time to market by providing advanced features, an extensible software eco-system, and powerful debug integration.
 

Software Libraries and Device Support
The Atmel Software Framework is a collection of production-ready source code such as drivers, communication stacks, graphic services and touch functionality. Tap into 1,600 project examples with source code to accelerate development of new applications.

 
Atmel GalleryYou can now download and securely purchase both Atmel and third-party compilers, advanced debugging tools, real-time operating systems, communication systems and other extensions and plug-ins straight from the Atmel Studio 7 development platform and via gallery.atmel.com. The Atmel Gallery app store provides development tools and embedded software for MCU-based application design.When you encounter a need for a tool in the midst of your development process, or are seeking some basic source code, you won't have to leave your environment to search for your solution. From Atmel Gallery, you can also download a plug-in that will give you direct access to Atmel Spaces, our new collaborative workspace.
 
Atmel Spaces Collaborative WorkspaceWith embedded applications easily topping tens of thousands of lines of code—often written by designers dispersed around the globe—efficient collaboration is critical for a project's success. Atmel Spaces provides a cloud-based workspace where you can securely share and track open-source, community-developed embedded design projects with your peers.With access control, version control, bug and feature trackers, mailing lists and wikis, Atmel Spaces provides a secure and efficient place for sharing design tips, tricks and resources and for tracking progress of projects with your peers.You can access Atmel Spaces at spaces.atmel.com or directly from Atmel Studio with an extension available in Atmel Gallery.
 
Atmel Data VisualizerTrack your applications run-time and power behavior using the powerful Atmel Data Visualizer plug-in. It provides an oscilloscope view of signals such as GPIO, SPI, UART, etc.and also provides live power measurements when used together with a supported probe or board. Having full control of your codes run-time behavior has never been easier.

 
QTouch Composer - Fully IntegratedThe Atmel QTouch® Composer, formerly called QTouch Studio, is coming to Atmel Studio 7 in early December, allowing you to seamlessly develop capacitive touch functionality for your application. This simplifies the design process by tying together the tools required to edit the code in Atmel Studio 7 and tune the touch design in QTouch Composer.More about QTouch Tools						 
						
 
Editor and C/C++ CompilerAtmel Studio 7 includes a powerful editor with visual assist, a GNU C/C++ Compiler and a New Project Wizard to jump-start as well as ease your application code development.
More about the Editor Debugging and SimulationAtmel Studio 7 connects seamlessly to all Atmel debuggers, programmers and the simulators for both ARM-based and AVR devices. The IDE presents MCU status in nicely formatted views, giving you fast access to critical system parameters.More about Atmel debuggers

History[edit]




Logo from 1984 to 2012


Founding and 1980s growth[edit]
Atmel Corporation was founded in 1984, by George Perlegos.[5] Atmel was an acronym for “advanced technology for memory and logic”. Perlegos had worked in the memory group of Intel in the 1970s and had co-founded Seeq Technology to manufacture EPROM memory. Using only US$30,000 in capital, Atmel was initially operated as a fabless company, using Sanyo and General Instrument to make the chip wafers.[6] The first Atmel memory products used less power than competitors. Customers included Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson. In 1987 Intel sued Atmel for patent infringement.[7] Rather than fight the patent claim, Atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property. These had better performance and even lower power consumption. In addition, Atmel then entered the flash memory business that Intel had focused on. Atmel used US$60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from Honeywell in Colorado Springs.[7] Atmel then invested another US$30 million in manufacturing technology.
1990s expansion[edit]

In 1991, Atmel expanded the Colorado facility after acquiring Concurrent Logic, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) manufacturer. The company made its initial public offering (IPO) in 1991 which yielded more than US$65 million. 1994 saw Atmel enter the microprocessor market. The first Atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the Intel 8051.[8] The controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle, as opposed to the 12 cycles that legacy 8051 parts required.[9] In 1994, Atmel purchased the EEROM assets of Seeq Technology (LSI Corporation acquired the rest of Seeq in 1999) . In 1995 Atmel was among the first companies to license the ARM architecture, creating initially its AT91 family of devices, followed by the SAM family, and more recently a full selection of Cortex-based solutions, including ones based on the ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M4.[10] Atmel now has dozens of families of ARM-based devices. In 1995, Atmel opened a fabrication facility in Rousset, France. Atmel acquired European Silicon Structures and Digital Research in Electronic Acoustics and Music (DREAM) in 1996. Atmel formed a design team in Trondheim, Norway to develop the Atmel AVR line of RISC microcontrollers. This team combined technology of former students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with Atmel's expertise in flash memory. These 8-bit Harvard architecture chips were first developed in 1996. The AVR chip is the basis of most Arduino open-source development boards. In 1998, Atmel purchased part of TEMIC from Vishay Intertechnology, which provided them with a fab in Germany as well as part of MHS from Vishay that gave them a fab in Nantes, France.[11]
In September 2000, Atmel acquired a fabrication plant in North Tyneside, England, from Siemens, via a £28 million grant from the UK government and paying Siemens around US$35 million.[12]
Streamlining[edit]
Atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called "fab-lite". This started in 2005 when Atmel sold the MHS fab in Nantes France to Xbybus. In February 2006, Steven Laub became a director and in August president and chief executive officer.[1] Under Laub Atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines.[13] Atmel announced the sale of its North Tyneside facility (Fab9) on October 8, 2007. The manufacturing equipment was sold to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) and the property and associated land to Highbridge Business Park Limited. In 2008 Atmel sold their fab in Germany to Tejas semiconductor. In 2010 Atmel received approval from the French government to sell its fab to Germany-based LFoundry GmbH, while retaining their design center there.[14] Atmel completed the sale of their Secure Microcontroller Solutions smart card business to INSIDE Secure. In February 2011, Atmel sold its Digital Research in Electronics, Acoustics and Music (DREAM) business, which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines, for US$2.3 million. Atmel's DataFlash serial interface flash memory products were sold to Adesto Technologies in October 2012.[15]
Acquisitions[edit]

As Atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines, Laub also oversaw acquisitions. One strategy was to participate in the touch screen market, both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves. In 2008 Atmel purchased Quantum Research Group Ltd. (now known as Atmel Technologies Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary), a supplier of capacitive sensing technology.[16] Work done at Quantum, led to the 2012 release of Atmel's XSense product line, a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes.[17]
Atmel moved into Internet of things technology. They completed the acquisition of Advanced Digital Design S.A, a Spanish company that develops power line communication. Ozmo Devices, which developed products for Wi-Fi Direct, was acquired by Atmel in December 2012. Ozmo was founded in 2004 as H-Stream Wireless by Kateljin Vleugels and Roel Peeters, and was based in Palo Alto, California.[18]
In 2012, Atmel had approximately US$1.4 billion in annual revenue, with over 60% of their revenue from microcontrollers, and net income of US$30 million.[1]
Atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of IDT Corporation in March 2013.[19]
Atmel purchased Newport Media in July 2014. This will provide Atmel further capability in wireless Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.[20]
Acquisition by Microchip Technology[edit]
In 2016, Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for $3.6 billion.[3][4] JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst Partners served as financial advisers to Microchip and Atmel, respectively. The company had previously heard offers from Cypress Semiconductor and Dialog Semiconductor in 2015,[21][22] and the deal with Microchip is expected to be finalized at the end of Q2 2016.[23]
Previously in October 2008, Atmel received an unsolicited offer from Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor, estimated at US$2.3 billion.[24][25] The offer was eventually rejected and the companies gave up on their hostile takeover attempt.[26][27]
Atmel merged with Microchip Technology on July 2016 after prolonged negotiations for US$3.56 billion.[28][29]

A large part of Atmel's revenue is from microcontrollers. These include the AVR 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers, ARM architecture microprocessors, and ARM-based flash microcontrollers. In addition Atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the 8051 architecture, albeit improved to do single-cycle instructions. Supporting the microcontrollers is the Atmel Studio 7 integrated development environment which Atmel offers for free. They also provide an Atmel Software Framework.[30]
Wireless / RF[edit]
To provide for the Internet of Things (IoT), Atmel offers dual-band 2.4 GHz/5 GHz a/b/g Wi-Fi chips from its Ozmo acquisition. Also, Atmel offers 2.4 GHz b/g/n Wi-Fi chips WILC1000/WILC3000 and WINC1500 from its Newport Media, Inc acquisition. WINC1500 provide a full 802.11 b/g/n network controller with full ip stack TCP/IP, UDP with upper layer protocols as DHCP, DNS, HTTP, SNTP, TLS etc. Also, Atmel makes wireless transceivers using regional 700/800/900 MHz, as well as global 2.4 GHz frequency bands, Some chips are standalone transceivers while others are integrated with a microcontroller. They also sell the Zigbit module that comes with FCC certifications. Atmel also makes remote control RF products using the license-free ISM band (industrial scientific medical) frequencies (5.8 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 868 to 928 MHz, 433 MHz, and 315 MHz). The wireless segment also provides RFID chips for tracking, access and identification. Finally, Atmel offers a line of IR controllers that can support infrared as well as RF wireless.[citation needed]
Touchscreen[edit]




Atmel XSense is a flexible touchscreen film that uses a copper mesh instead of indium tin oxide (ITO).


Atmel makes both touchscreen controller ICs and its XSense flexible touchscreen.[17] The company makes sensor hubs that manage accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units and magnetometers. These sensors give consumer products and embedded systems context awareness. The sensor hub offloads the main application processor and allows product functionality without the need to power the main processor. Atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons, sliders, and wheels used on industrial and consumer products. The touch wheel interface became popularized by the Apple iPod. To support the application of its touch controller chips, Atmel provides a free QTouch library of software routines.[citation needed]
Memory[edit]
Atmel's original business was in memory, and it still sells several memory products. It offers serial and parallel EEPROM, as well as one-time programmable (OTP) EPROM. In addition, it offers secure memory with its CryptoMemory product line of EEPROMS in capacities from 1 to 256 kbits.[citation needed]
Security[edit]
In addition to the secure memory mentioned above, they have the CryptoAuthentication product lines that provide hardware authentication capability with both symmetric and asymmetric-key algorithm authentication. These ICs are used in many applications, including secure access, communications, control, and to prevent cloned products like batteries or ink cartridges not approved by the product manufacturer. Atmel's CryptoRF products add hardware encrypted security to RFID applications. Finally Atmel offers a trusted platform module that gives strong hardware-based public key (RSA algorithm) security for both personal computers and embedded processors on a single chip.[citation needed]
Analog[edit]
Atmel makes LED driver chips. It also has a line of digital-output temperature sensors. The company also makes power management and analog companions (PMAAC) that combine a group of discrete ICs often used in handheld or battery-powered products. Integrated functions include audio codecs (compressor-decompressor), lithium-ion battery chargers, and stereo digital-to-analog converters.[citation needed]
Custom[edit]
These products include custom integrated circuits designed to meet specialized single-customer requirements. Products include FPGAs, products with military and aerospace applications, and application-specific standard products (ASSP) for space applications, power management, and secure cryptographic memory products.[citation needed]
Automotive[edit]
Atmel modified or specialized many of its products for the automotive market. These products often have a wider temperature range or are specially qualified for automotive applications. These products include car access, touch control, radio, CAN, VAN, and LIN Bus networking, battery management, high-temperature drivers, and serial EEPROMs.[citation needed]
Smart energy[edit]
Atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets. These chips combine microprocessors with tamper-proof hardware security and power line communication modems. The parts also integrate analog front-ends for accurate metrology.[citation needed]

History[edit]

Founding and 1980s growth[edit]
Atmel Corporation was founded in 1984, by George Perlegos.[5] Atmel was an acronym for “advanced technology for memory and logic”. Perlegos had worked in the memory group of Intel in the 1970s and had co-founded Seeq Technology to manufacture EPROM memory. Using only US$30,000 in capital, Atmel was initially operated as a fabless company, using Sanyo and General Instrument to make the chip wafers.[6] The first Atmel memory products used less power than competitors. Customers included Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson. In 1987 Intel sued Atmel for patent infringement.[7] Rather than fight the patent claim, Atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property. These had better performance and even lower power consumption. In addition, Atmel then entered the flash memory business that Intel had focused on. Atmel used US$60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from Honeywell in Colorado Springs.[7] Atmel then invested another US$30 million in manufacturing technology.
1990s expansion[edit]

In 1991, Atmel expanded the Colorado facility after acquiring Concurrent Logic, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) manufacturer. The company made its initial public offering (IPO) in 1991 which yielded more than US$65 million. 1994 saw Atmel enter the microprocessor market. The first Atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the Intel 8051.[8] The controller executed an instruction for every clock cycle, as opposed to the 12 cycles that legacy 8051 parts required.[9] In 1994, Atmel purchased the EEROM assets of Seeq Technology (LSI Corporation acquired the rest of Seeq in 1999) . In 1995 Atmel was among the first companies to license the ARM architecture, creating initially its AT91 family of devices, followed by the SAM family, and more recently a full selection of Cortex-based solutions, including ones based on the ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M4.[10] Atmel now has dozens of families of ARM-based devices. In 1995, Atmel opened a fabrication facility in Rousset, France. Atmel acquired European Silicon Structures and Digital Research in Electronic Acoustics and Music (DREAM) in 1996. Atmel formed a design team in Trondheim, Norway to develop the Atmel AVR line of RISC microcontrollers. This team combined technology of former students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with Atmel's expertise in flash memory. These 8-bit Harvard architecture chips were first developed in 1996. The AVR chip is the basis of most Arduino open-source development boards. In 1998, Atmel purchased part of TEMIC from Vishay Intertechnology, which provided them with a fab in Germany as well as part of MHS from Vishay that gave them a fab in Nantes, France.[11]
In September 2000, Atmel acquired a fabrication plant in North Tyneside, England, from Siemens, via a £28 million grant from the UK government and paying Siemens around US$35 million.[12]
Streamlining[edit]
Atmel streamlined operations with a strategy called "fab-lite". This started in 2005 when Atmel sold the MHS fab in Nantes France to Xbybus. In February 2006, Steven Laub became a director and in August president and chief executive officer.[1] Under Laub Atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines.[13] Atmel announced the sale of its North Tyneside facility (Fab9) on October 8, 2007. The manufacturing equipment was sold to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) and the property and associated land to Highbridge Business Park Limited. In 2008 Atmel sold their fab in Germany to Tejas semiconductor. In 2010 Atmel received approval from the French government to sell its fab to Germany-based LFoundry GmbH, while retaining their design center there.[14] Atmel completed the sale of their Secure Microcontroller Solutions smart card business to INSIDE Secure. In February 2011, Atmel sold its Digital Research in Electronics, Acoustics and Music (DREAM) business, which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines, for US$2.3 million. Atmel's DataFlash serial interface flash memory products were sold to Adesto Technologies in October 2012.[15]
Acquisitions[edit]

As Atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines, Laub also oversaw acquisitions. One strategy was to participate in the touch screen market, both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves. In 2008 Atmel purchased Quantum Research Group Ltd. (now known as Atmel Technologies Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary), a supplier of capacitive sensing technology.[16] Work done at Quantum, led to the 2012 release of Atmel's XSense product line, a flexible touch screen based on copper mesh electrodes.[17]
Atmel moved into Internet of things technology. They completed the acquisition of Advanced Digital Design S.A, a Spanish company that develops power line communication. Ozmo Devices, which developed products for Wi-Fi Direct, was acquired by Atmel in December 2012. Ozmo was founded in 2004 as H-Stream Wireless by Kateljin Vleugels and Roel Peeters, and was based in Palo Alto, California.[18]
In 2012, Atmel had approximately US$1.4 billion in annual revenue, with over 60% of their revenue from microcontrollers, and net income of US$30 million.[1]
Atmel purchased the smart metering product lines of IDT Corporation in March 2013.[19]
Atmel purchased Newport Media in July 2014. This will provide Atmel further capability in wireless Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.[20]
Acquisition by Microchip Technology[edit]
In 2016, Microchip agreed to buy Atmel for $3.6 billion.[3][4] JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst Partners served as financial advisers to Microchip and Atmel, respectively. The company had previously heard offers from Cypress Semiconductor and Dialog Semiconductor in 2015,[21][22] and the deal with Microchip is expected to be finalized at the end of Q2 2016.[23]
Previously in October 2008, Atmel received an unsolicited offer from Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor, estimated at US$2.3 billion.[24][25] The offer was eventually rejected and the companies gave up on their hostile takeover attempt.[26][27]
Atmel merged with Microchip Technology on July 2016 after prolonged negotiations for US$3.56 billion.[28][29]
Products[edit]
Microcontrollers[edit]




Atmel AT90S2333 microcontroller






Atmel ATMEGA32 microcontroller


A large part of Atmel's revenue is from microcontrollers. These include the AVR 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers, ARM architecture microprocessors, and ARM-based flash microcontrollers. In addition Atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the 8051 architecture, albeit improved to do single-cycle instructions. Supporting the microcontrollers is the Atmel Studio 7 integrated development environment which Atmel offers for free. They also provide an Atmel Software Framework.[30]
Wireless / RF[edit]
To provide for the Internet of Things (IoT), Atmel offers dual-band 2.4 GHz/5 GHz a/b/g Wi-Fi chips from its Ozmo acquisition. Also, Atmel offers 2.4 GHz b/g/n Wi-Fi chips WILC1000/WILC3000 and WINC1500 from its Newport Media, Inc acquisition. WINC1500 provide a full 802.11 b/g/n network controller with full ip stack TCP/IP, UDP with upper layer protocols as DHCP, DNS, HTTP, SNTP, TLS etc. Also, Atmel makes wireless transceivers using regional 700/800/900 MHz, as well as global 2.4 GHz frequency bands, Some chips are standalone transceivers while others are integrated with a microcontroller. They also sell the Zigbit module that comes with FCC certifications. Atmel also makes remote control RF products using the license-free ISM band (industrial scientific medical) frequencies (5.8 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 868 to 928 MHz, 433 MHz, and 315 MHz). The wireless segment also provides RFID chips for tracking, access and identification. Finally, Atmel offers a line of IR controllers that can support infrared as well as RF wireless.[citation needed]
Touchscreen[edit]




Atmel XSense is a flexible touchscreen film that uses a copper mesh instead of indium tin oxide (ITO).


Atmel makes both touchscreen controller ICs and its XSense flexible touchscreen.[17] The company makes sensor hubs that manage accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units and magnetometers. These sensors give consumer products and embedded systems context awareness. The sensor hub offloads the main application processor and allows product functionality without the need to power the main processor. Atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons, sliders, and wheels used on industrial and consumer products. The touch wheel interface became popularized by the Apple iPod. To support the application of its touch controller chips, Atmel provides a free QTouch library of software routines.[citation needed]
Memory[edit]
Atmel's original business was in memory, and it still sells several memory products. It offers serial and parallel EEPROM, as well as one-time programmable (OTP) EPROM. In addition, it offers secure memory with its CryptoMemory product line of EEPROMS in capacities from 1 to 256 kbits.[citation needed]
Security[edit]
In addition to the secure memory mentioned above, they have the CryptoAuthentication product lines that provide hardware authentication capability with both symmetric and asymmetric-key algorithm authentication. These ICs are used in many applications, including secure access, communications, control, and to prevent cloned products like batteries or ink cartridges not approved by the product manufacturer. Atmel's CryptoRF products add hardware encrypted security to RFID applications. Finally Atmel offers a trusted platform module that gives strong hardware-based public key (RSA algorithm) security for both personal computers and embedded processors on a single chip.[citation needed]
Analog[edit]
Atmel makes LED driver chips. It also has a line of digital-output temperature sensors. The company also makes power management and analog companions (PMAAC) that combine a group of discrete ICs often used in handheld or battery-powered products. Integrated functions include audio codecs (compressor-decompressor), lithium-ion battery chargers, and stereo digital-to-analog converters.[citation needed]
Custom[edit]
These products include custom integrated circuits designed to meet specialized single-customer requirements. Products include FPGAs, products with military and aerospace applications, and application-specific standard products (ASSP) for space applications, power management, and secure cryptographic memory products.[citation needed]
Automotive[edit]
Atmel modified or specialized many of its products for the automotive market. These products often have a wider temperature range or are specially qualified for automotive applications. These products include car access, touch control, radio, CAN, VAN, and LIN Bus networking, battery management, high-temperature drivers, and serial EEPROMs.[citation needed]
Smart energy[edit]
Atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets. These chips combine microprocessors with tamper-proof hardware security and power line communication modems. The parts also integrate analog front-ends for accurate metrology.[citation needed]
