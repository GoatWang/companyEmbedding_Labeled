Nasdaq RigaAnnouncement from the exchangeAS HansaMatrix announcement on recent private placementAdditional details on recent private placementJuly 8, 2016, 2016-07-08 13:13 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
	During the month of June 2016 AS HansaMatrix (’The Company’) undertook a private placement of both primary and secondary shares. Key aspects of the transaction:

·         A total of 377,335 shares were allocated, of which 94,334 were secondary. 

·         Pricing was fixed at EUR 6.53 per share.  

·         The shares were placed with various investors, including certain Baltic pension funds.  

Existing investor “FlyCap Investment Fund I AIF” also participated and it now has a higher post-transaction shareholding percentage in the Company.
	 

The largest present shareholder, SIA “MACRO RĪGA”, a company linked to the CEO and founder, sold some existing shares during the transaction. This is in line with the long-term strategy of the founder to gradually return to their previous shareholding level of around 25% prior to the management buyout (MBO) several years ago. The MBO was undertaken to ensure the Company’s strategy to develop in-house technology by incorporating an original design manufacturing (ODM) business model into the operations. This is where meaningful growth and profitability is expected to be found rather than retaining only a standard contract manufacturing business, which typically carries lower margins.

	 

The Company’s shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Main List by Nasdaq Riga as of July 12, 2016. In light of this AS HansaMatrix is organizing a webinar on July 11, 2016 at 15:00 (EET).

HansaMatrixInterim report (Q1 and Q3)AS HansaMatrix Consolidated Interim Report for Q1 year 2017.During the period of Q1 of the Year 2017 AS HansaMatrix unaudited consolidated net turnover has increased by 35% and reached 4.495 million EUR; reported EBITDA result was 176% higher, and reached 0.968 million EUR, net profit was substantially higher and was 0.412 million EUR in comparison with period of Q1 2016.Riga, 2017-05-25 07:26 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
	During the first quarter (“Q1” further in document) of 2017 the Company reported sales volume increase by 35% compared to the same period of 2016 and reached 4.495 million EUR. This is considerably good achievement considering typically weak demand from some of customers at a beginning of year. The 2017 Q1 sales results showed 10% sales volume decrease in comparison with previous quarter – 2016 Q4 which reflects usual seasonality pattern.

During Q1 2017 the Company reported substantially increased quarterly EBITDA result of 0.968 million EUR and quarterly net profit result of 0.412 million EUR. The reported EBITDA result demonstrate 176% increase in comparison with Q1 2016 and 73% increase from previous – Q4 2016. The quarterly net profit results for Q1 2017 demonstrate increase in comparison with Q1 2016 when net loss of 0.04 million EUR was reported and 195% increase from previous – Q4 2016. Results represent quarterly EBITDA margin of 22% and net profit margin of 9%.

Substantially increased levels of quarterly result margins to large extent can be explained of increased market demand for higher margin products that have been manufactured and sold during Q1 2017 as well as increased utilization of recently invested new production capacities in production fulfilment.

During rolling 12 month period which started on April 1, 2016 and finished on March 31, 2017, the Company reported sales revenue increase of 7% and revenue result of 18.12 million EUR, EBITDA increase by 28% and result of 2.832 million EUR, in comparison with 12 month period ending on December 31, 2016.
