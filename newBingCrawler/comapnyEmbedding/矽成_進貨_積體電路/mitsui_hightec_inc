                                    Mitsui High-tec, Inc. has been contributing to development of the electronics, automobile and industrial machinery. We produce, exports, and sells IC leadframes, motor cores, mold dies, trim and form dies, IC assemblies, precision tooling and parts, stamping dies, precision machine tools, and other type of stamping tools in Japan and internationally. The company was founded by Takaaki Mitsui in 1949 and is headquartered in Kitakyushu, Japan.
Products:

Precision Tooling / Precision Parts
    Since its foundation, Mitsui High-tec, Inc. has produced a wide range of tooling (kanagata), specializing in those for motor cores and IC leadframes. Electric motor cores (rotors and stators), automobile components, coins, IC leadframes, resin injection molding and so on: Mitsui’s stamped products and precision tooling are used all over the world.
    Precision tooling for motor core is cost efficient as well as helps environment by conserving energy and natural resources. Our mission is to provide products useful to people all over the world.
    In fact you will find Mitsui motors in various products such as air conditioning systems compressor, hybrid vehicle drive motors. We also newly built a precision tooling factory as an effort for improving product quality under clean, controlled environment. 
Leadframe
    A leadframe is a thin layer of metal that connects the wiring from tiny electrical terminals on the semiconductor surface to the large-scale circuitry on electrical devices and circuit boards. Leadframes are used in almost all semiconductor packages.
    Mitsui High-tec accomplished the production of IC leadframes by precision-die-stamping for the first time in the world and, at present, we are producing leadframes not only by stamping but also by chemical etching. 
IC Assembly
    Mitsui High-tec Inc. is tackling the development and mass production of IC package and has prepared abundant product lineup backed up by our ultra-precision technology base having been polished since its foundation in order to respond to customers’ demand.
    We are internally producing IC leadframes that are the most important components among IC Assembly materials. In addition, by own development of dies, machine tools and jigs, based on our long-accumulated manufacturing technology, we can flexibly respond to the diversified needs arising form development to mass production and supply products in a short delivery term and at a low price.
Motor Core
    A large motor is used in a hybrid car as a driver. The motors of this type are for driving a large device but they are manufactured in full consideration of efficiency and economy so as to be ecological and to ensure the performance of comfortable drive.
    Furthermore motors are used in many places where electricity works such as personal computers, household electrical appliances, electrical equipment and robots.
    We are producing many products deeply related to our daily life such as the parts constituting a motor and the dies for producing rotors and stators, and also offering stamping service as a comprehensive supplier of dies.

About Mitsui High-Tec


Mitsui High-tec, Inc. (formerly Mitsui Mfg.), is the world's foremost supplier of leadframes for integrated circuits. We also make and sell dies unrivaled anywhere for durability and precision. We have put the same expertise to work in a successful lineup of machine tools.

Today, more than 50 years after starting operations as a tiny die-making shop with only two employees, Mitsui High-tec boasts annual sales in excess of $350 million US. Since July 1991 our stock has been listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We count manufacturers in more than 30 countries among our customers, serving them through an international network of manufacturing and marketing bases.

This impressive growth has arisen from the strength of one innovative advance after another, always in advance of a rising demand. We have improved on the work of others and achieved revolutionary technological advances on our own. In every way, we have continually managed to provide customers with products offering better performance at lower cost. This also reflects our dedication to the "umbrella theory," which systematically demonstrates that lower prices will deepen and broaden demand.

Founded in 1957



The Mitsui High-Tec Approach

At Mitsui High-tec, we reject easy, cost-based rationalizations for price increases. And we do not condone dumping tactics for building or clinging onto market share. Neither approach is in the long-term interests of any company or its customers.

The only sure formula for corporate vitality is to furnish customers with the quantity and quality of goods they require, when they need them, and at prices they can afford. This simple formula is anything but easy to implement, demanding strong, yet flexible, management and a genuine commitment to technological innovation.

We believe that our 50 years of phenomenal growth evidence the validity of our premise. Putting sound principles into practice has enabled us to increase sales volume dramatically, and we fully intend to sustain similar progress in the years ahead.
  
Mitsui High-Tec Engineering

Technological refinements and innovations have earned business for Mitsui High-tec by minimizing product prices while maximizing quality and performance. Sophisticated engineering, however, is no longer enough in today's economic environment to ensure the kind of spectacular growth our company has enjoyed to date. We will step up and broaden our programs to sustain our steady expansion as a truly international corporation.

Work in this direction is already paying off in more effective management. A new generation of managers is learning to run an increasingly comprehensive, technology-intensive company. The office automation equipment we are installing throughout our organization makes us more efficient, as does the computerization of design and manufacture, where our computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems enhance the quality of work and expedite operations dramatically.





We also share our expertise with customers through services conveniently offered by our international network. For instance, our ongoing research and development extends to materials technology and machining techniques, and we often make helpful recommendations in this regard.
Manufacturing Highlights
We have built our market share by continually upgrading our production facilities to minimize costs and maximize quality.

Mechanization
Machines, including automated machines we developed for use in production lines, do 95 percent of manufacturing work at Mitsui High-tec.

CAD/CAM
Computer-aided design and manufacturing not only speed up production but also help us match products perfectly to the individual requirements of customers. This is a critical advantage in consideration of the growing diversity of tooling needs.

Tungsten Carbide Dies
Mitsui High-tec precision dies minify costs in stamping, and our new dies maximize versatility via interchangeability for flexible manufacturing systems. The broad implications of our superiority in die manufacturing are clear when one considers the central role of stamping in sectors ranging from the automobile industry, where more than half the parts that go into a car are stamped, to electronics, where leadframes stand as the epitome of stamping precision.

Ultrahigh-speed Stamping
Quality, performance, durability, and price are what draw customers to Mitsui High-tec stampings, but our ultrahigh-speed stamping machinery is what helps us meet demand for these products. Stamping at 1,000 strokes a minute, in two and four rows, also contributes to lower costs.
