NEC Provides Design Tool to Faraday Technology Corporation in Taiwan
- Synthesizing Low Delay and Low Latency Circuits -  



 

  
Tweet 

  


  

Tokyo, January 19, 2017 - NEC Corporation (NEC; TSE: 6701) today announced that it provided Faraday Technology Corporation, a major fabless IC vendor in Taiwan, with CyberWorkBench®, a design tool capable of synthesizing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)/Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) circuits from the C programming language.
Faraday is utilizing CyberWorkBench (CWB) to design FPGA for communication control. The FPGA are designed as an ASIC prototype for communication control, with the scope of the product's application scheduled to be extended to ASIC. Sales of CWB to Faraday were conducted by NEC's partner, Avant Technology Inc.
CWB is an integrated design environment consisting of a high-level synthesis tool, as well as dynamic and static verification capabilities that shorten the design period by automatically converting the Large Scale Integrated Circuit (LSI) functions written in C language into circuits that satisfy both the circuit size (area) and performance needs. CWB has been used for design control LSI for equipment that requires high reliability such as satellites, communications equipment and backbone servers. Since its launch in 2006, CWB has been introduced internationally to more than 100 companies in the manufacturing industry.
The physical communication layer is required to have low delay (high frequency) and low latency (short operation cycle) circuits. Due to the complex functions, including error correction, it is not easy even for an experienced Register Transfer Level (RTL) designer to design a circuit that meets these two strict conditions. This product offers a variety of synthesizing options to synthesize low delay and low latency circuits from the functions written in C language. The use of these options facilitates  Faraday to synthesize a circuit that satisfies the low delay and low latency specifications in the physical layer of high-performance communications equipment. 
The function to be implemented in the circuit is written in C language in the initial design phase. When designing a low latency circuit, it is necessary to change the function written in C language into the contents that implement high-performance processing. In conventional manual RTL design, these changes require a great deal of fixing work and pose difficulties in terms of preventing errors from occurring. As the use of this product facilitates Faraday to automatically reflect the changes made in the functions written in C language in the circuits, the company is now able to reduce the manual hours for design to one sixth and to help prevent errors from occurring.
"NEC has been focusing on the Solutions for Society business, and it will contribute to the enhancement of corporate competitiveness by leveraging its experience in providing CWB to Faraday and by increasing the sales of the product to the diverse manufacturers involved in LSI design," said Aritomo Ishikawa, General Manager, Embedded Business Sales Division, NEC Corporation.

Faraday Introduces Configurable DSP IP


 Using the configurable feature of Faraday's FD230 DSP IP, customers can easily modify the DSP core for specific applications   HSINCHU, TAIWAN – January 23, 2003 Faraday Technology Corporation (TAIEX: 3035), a leading company in ASIC design service and IP development industry, announced that after a big success of its 16-bit embedded DSP core, FD216, the company released the next promising DSP core on its product roadmap. "Faraday Draco 230 (FD230) DSP IP" is a 16/20/24-bit configurable embedded DSP IP core with a superior flexibility letting users creatively tailor the DSP resolution.   "The new architecture allows the FD230 DSP core to be used across a wide-ranging product line from mid-performance to high-speed applications, while offering extendibility for product differentiation," said Frankwell Lin, Sales VP and Spokesman of Faraday. "The FD230 DSP core will expand Faraday's market presence from present MP3 player, digital voice recorder, photo printer, to new applications such as cable modem, multi-channel VoIP home gateway, and AC3 functions in DVD players."   The configurable architecture of FD230 DSP core enables customers to set the data paths of ALU, MAC, and SHT. Other features include an up to 16-MB addressable memory range and instruction cache, which can significantly speed up DSP operation performance and adopts the industry standard AHB bus interface. On the other hand, the flexibility of FD230 doesn't sacrifice its performance, which makes it more competitive. In UMC 0.18 um process, the FD230 DSP performs in excess of 200MHz in the worst case, while the power consumption is only 0.4mW/MHz. Faraday believes these features will enhance the design flexibility, shorten time-to-market, boost product efficiencies and reduce production risks.   To ensure an easy start, Faraday provides DSP customers with a complete developing environment which includes EV Boards, development tools and detailed documentation. Faraday also has a highly experienced team establishing DSP function library, which could greatly shorten customers' design cycle.

Faraday Announces Highly-Integrated Programmable SerDes-Based Communication Platform ASIC


HSINCHU, Taiwan and SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Oct. 3, 2006 -- Faraday Technology Corporation (TAIEX: 3035), a leading ASIC, Structured ASIC and IP provider, today announced NC Express(TM), the most state-of-the-art member of its flagship Composer(TM) Structured ASIC product line targeting communication, networking and enterprise applications. The device is a highly integrated SoC platform that combines Faraday's industry leading Metal Programmable Cell Array (MPCA(TM)) Structured ASIC technology with a high- performance low-latency data path architecture. Semiconductor and system companies can use Faraday's NC Express to serve as a foundation platform for architecting a cost-effective merchant SoC/ASSP device or system-level ASICs. With 60% of the final design already completed using silicon-proven IP blocks, NC Express enables complex networking chips to be developed with 1/2 the engineering resources, a fraction of the NRE costs, while offering a minimum of 3x faster time to market advantage to SoC design teams. The device solves real SoC challenges by reducing IP verification and evaluation time, mitigating physical design and signal integrity risks associated with high-speed I/O integration, while future proofing the device with metal programmability. Launched as the follow-on to the company's successful NetComposer-1 (NC-1) platform, NC Express is the first in a family of SerDes-based platform ASIC products broadening Faraday's reach into networking, data center, security, and enterprise end markets, with built-in intelligence for dual-core SoC designs. The device includes a number of pre-diffused communication controllers, eight programmable multi-protocol SerDes channels supporting PCIe, GbE, 10GbE/XAUI, SATA/SAS, FC, and sRIO date rates (1.25 - 3.125 Gbps), a 400/533 MHz DDR-2 memory controller with ECC, and a high-speed ARM(TM)v4 compatible CPU running Linux O/S with associated peripherals. Additionally, the chip includes 4x GbE MACs, a10GbE/XAUI MAC, and a complete PCI Express controller with associated SerDes PCS layers. The metal programmable flexibility combined with advanced system-level IP integration in NC Express make the device suitable for a variety of SoC designs targeting high-performance, low-cost, and yet power-sensitive applications including various AdvancedMC(TM) I/O blades for ATCA and MicroTCA(TM) platforms (AMC.x); NICs for server, storage and data centers; networking protocol bridges; and single-chip enterprise, NAS, and home gateway designs. "The NC Express is a result of several years of market research and R&D cooperation with our key customers and IP partners," said H.P. Lin, President of Faraday Technology Corporation. "The product demonstrates our commitment to the platform ASIC market as a vehicle to enable our customers to significantly reduce development costs and risks." "With increasing cost to develop an ASIC, the NC Express product offers a timely, cost-effective and flexible alternative for medium-volume market segments," said Jag Bolaria, Senior Analyst at the Linley Group. "The product's metal programmable technology enables companies to apply a common architecture across multiple applications." "NC Express builds on our successful application-oriented and market- focused Platform ASIC strategy," said Christopher Moezzi, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development for Faraday's International Business Unit. "Our differentiated approach in architecting Platform ASICs has enabled our ASSP customers to concentrate their design efforts on portions of the SoC where they add the most value, resulting in rapid portfolio expansion, faster time to market, and earlier ROI." Pricing and Availability: The FPGA EVB board for the NC Express is available now for customer evaluation, and Faraday is ready to accept customer Netlists for NC Express designs for samples in 2007. Unit volume pricing and NRE charges are available upon request. Faraday will be demonstrating the NC express FPGA evaluation board during Oct 17-19th at the ATCA Summit in Santa Clara, CA. http://www.advancedtcasummit.com/ About Faraday Technology Corporation Faraday Technology Corporation is a leading silicon IP and fabless ASIC vendor.
