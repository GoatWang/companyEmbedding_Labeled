公司簡介



聯華電子身為半導體晶圓專工業界的領導者，提供先進製程與晶圓製造服務，為IC產業各項主要應用產品生產晶片。聯電完整的解決方案能讓晶片設計公司利用尖端製程的優勢，包括28奈米Poly-SiON技術、High-K/Metal Gate後閘極技術、14奈米量產、超低功耗且專為物聯網（IoT）應用設計的製程平台以及具汽車行業最高評級的AEC-Q100 Grade-0製造能力，用於生產汽車中的IC。 聯電現共有十一座晶圓廠，遍及亞洲各地，每月可生產超過60萬片晶圓。聯電在全球超過19,000名員工，在台灣、日本、韓國、中國、新加坡、歐洲及美國均設有服務據點，以滿足全球客戶的需求。
業界的領導者
聯電成立於1980年，為台灣第一家半導體公司，引領了台灣半導體業的發展，是台灣第一家提供晶圓專工服務的公司，也是台灣第一家上市的半導體公司（1985年）。聯電以策略創新見長，首創員工分紅入股制度，此制度已被公認為引領台灣電子產業快速成功發展的主因。聯電同時也透過MyUMC線上服務，讓客戶能在線上取得完整的供應鏈資訊，此服務於1998年上線，亦為業界首創。
完備的解決方案
聯電承諾即時提供尖端的解決方案，以滿足客戶在面對今日先進應用產品上特殊以及獨特的需求。聯電與客戶以及協力夥伴在整個供應鏈上緊密合作，包括生產設備、電子自動化工具與IP廠商，以確保每一個客戶的系統單晶片生產成功。同時聯電也擁有整合客戶設計與先進製程技術以及IP所必備的系統設計及架構知識，更能使今日的系統單晶片設計達到首次試產即成功的結果。
聯電的解決方案從一個邏輯平台開始，在這裡設計公司可以選擇最適合他們產品的製程技術和電晶體選項。從邏輯平台之後，客戶可以根據個別需要，進一步選擇RFCMOS與嵌入式快閃記憶體等技術來微調製程。此外，隨著IP已經成為今日系統單晶片的關鍵資源，藉由合作夥伴或是內部自行研發，我們也提供經過最佳化、符合可攜帶性和成本需求之基本系統單晶片設計區塊以及更複雜的IP。
聯電擁有尖端的製程技術，涵蓋廣泛的IP組合，完備的系統知識以及先進的12吋晶圓製造技術，能在最有效的時間內提供完整解決方案，以確保客戶的成功。
世界級的生產製造
聯電擁有數座營運中的先進12吋晶圓廠。位於台南的Fab 12A於2002年進入量產，目前已運用先進28奈米製程為生產客戶產品。研發製造複和廠區由三個獨立的晶圓廠，P1＆2，P3＆4，以及P5＆6廠區組成，產能目前超過75,000片/月。第二座12吋廠Fab 12i為聯電特殊技術中心，提供客戶多樣化的應用產品所需IC，於12吋特殊製程的生產製造。廠址位於新加坡白沙晶圓科技園區，目前產能達50,000片/月的水準。最新的12吋晶圓廠是位於中國廈門的Fab 12X，已於2016年第4季度開始量產。其總設計產能為50,000片/月。除了12吋廠外，加上聯電擁有的七座8吋廠與一座6吋廠，每月總產能超過600,000片8吋約當晶圓。 
全方位的服務
純晶圓專工業務為聯電的核心服務，除了透過先進的研發能力提供尖端技術外，同時也提供優異的製造能力，包括量產的28奈米高介電金屬閘極（High-K / Metal Gate ）的後閘極技術製程，以及位於台灣、新加坡與中國廈門的12吋晶圓廠。此外，聯電採用全方位的IP方案，並以安全政策保護我們客戶與協力廠商的智慧財產權。請參考聯電完整的解決方案，而關於其他晶圓專工服務與一般客戶接洽流程，請參考本公司的服務流程圖。

聯華電子為世界一流的晶圓專工公司，成立於1980年，是台灣第一家上市的半導體公司，更在台灣半導體業發展史上扮演舉足輕重的角色。旗下現有一座6吋、七座8吋與二座12吋晶圓廠，先進製程技術涵蓋電子工業的每一應用領域，並率先採用嶄新的製程技術及材料，其中包括銅導線技術、低介電值阻絕層、嵌入式記憶體、混合訊號及射頻元件製程。領先全球，首先導入銅製程及量產；發展先進製程，使90奈米製程量產及12吋晶圓快速量產。聯電同時也是首先產出65奈米製程晶片給客戶之晶圓專工公司，並與數家國際大廠緊密合作，積極投入45及32奈米製程的研發，並獲得卓越成就。

聯華電子自1999年於南部科學工業園區台南園區投資三十億美元，建立國內第一座的十二吋晶圓廠 Fab12A，並將研發團隊南移，以加速先進技術於產品生產上的移轉及量產。聯電南科研發大樓亦於2007年正式啟用，這座南台灣唯一的半導體奈米製程研發中心，將為客戶提供先進製程及研發的完整服務方案，並預期成為南部半導體人才培育的重心。


 
 





 
聯華電子成立於1980年，並於1995年由自有產品的公司型態轉型為晶圓專工公司後，陸續於1998年併購日本新日鐵半導體，2001年於新加坡興建十二吋晶圓廠，逐步建立全球化佈局及全方位供應鏈。從海外生產基地的佈置、業務行銷、客戶服務、技術研發、人才引進、資本運作、到智慧財的專利申請，全球化佈局之於聯電，是一個累積的過程，是一系統化、持續性、多面向的長遠工作。

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  18.23 (08/03/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.12      Market Cap $5.71 B     Shares Outstanding 2.52 B     Public Float N/A     Yield 3.73% (08/03/17)      Latest Dividend $0.082729 (08/17/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 07/11/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 10.78 M     Change from Last  -44.22%      Percent of Float N/A       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.39      Net Money Flow ($)  32,773    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
