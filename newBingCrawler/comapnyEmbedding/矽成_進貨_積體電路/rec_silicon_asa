REC Silicon warns of Q3 revenues below expectation
Friday, 23 Sep 2016 
REC Silicon  said: Due to ongoing negative effects from the trade war between the U.S. and China and the recent decline in PV market conditions, lower sales than previously anticipated have occurred in the third quarter . As a result, third-quarter polysilicon sales volumes (excluding fines and powders) are now expected to be approximately 1,800 MT . Negotiations continue between the US and China towards a resolution of the trade war, but timing and outcome of such a resolution remain uncertain . Third quarter revenues are currently expected to be USD 45-50 million, compared to USD 71.1 million in the previous quarter .

The company is taking measures to maintain a healthy cash position and manage inventory levels . The company will adjust production capacity utilizationaccording to market demand and currently anticipates running at approximately 50% of full capacity at Moses Lake by October 1, 2016 .

REC Silicon warns of Q3 revenues below expectation
Friday, 23 Sep 2016 01:18am EDT 
REC Silicon  said: Due to ongoing negative effects from the trade war between the U.S. and China and the recent decline in PV market conditions, lower sales than previously anticipated have occurred in the third quarter . As a result, third-quarter polysilicon sales volumes (excluding fines and powders) are now expected to be approximately 1,800 MT .

Third quarter revenues are currently expected to be USD 45-50 million, compared to USD 71.1 million in the previous quarter . The decrease in revenue can be mainly attributed to lower FBR sales volumes . Q3 total polysilicon production volumes are forecasted to be roughly 3,900 MT, compared to guidance of 4,490 MT . The company is taking measures to maintain a healthy cash position and manage inventory levels . The company will adjust production capacity utilizationaccording to market demand and currently anticipates running at approximately 50% of full capacity at Moses Lake by October 1, 2016 .

REC Group (REC) is the leading European brand of solar panels and a vertically integrated solar energy company. REC manufactures silicon, wafers, cells, high-quality solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, and also provides turnkey Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) solutions. REC’s renowned product quality is supported by the lowest warranty claims rate in the industry.[1][2]
REC was founded in Norway in 1996 and has since come a long way; from hand-washing its first wafer to producing a cumulative total of 26 million panels in its history at end-2016.[3] REC is headquartered in Norway, with operational headquarters in Singapore. The company employs 2,000 people worldwide, with regional offices, local representatives, and partnerships in Europe, USA and Asia-Pacific regions to help meet the world’s growing energy needs.
Initially, the letters R-E-C stood for "Renewable Energy Corporation". Today, the company is known simply as "REC".

REC Group vs. REC Solar in the USA[edit]
REC Group (REC) is a leading manufacturer and brand of solar panels. REC panels are distributed and installed all over the world. REC’s sales operation is divided into four regions: EMEA (headquartered in Munich, Germany), APAC (headquartered in Singapore), the Americas (headquartered in San Mateo, California, USA), and Japan (headquartered in Tokyo). In some regions, REC is referred to as “REC Solar”.
In the USA, a company named REC Solar, Inc. operates as an installer of solar energy systems for commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications.[12] REC Group and REC Solar, Inc. are two separate companies with similar names in the same industry but have no direct relation to one another beyond REC Group being a supplier to REC Solar, Inc.
REC Solar, Inc. has used REC Group panels for many of its installations. In the USA, REC (the panel manufacturer) is known as “REC Americas”.
REC Group vs. REC Silicon[edit]
The former Renewable Energy Corporation ASA had two divisions: REC Silicon and REC Solar. In October 2013, these were split into two entirely separate entities, each focusing on its own core business.[13]
For REC Silicon, this was polysilicon and silane gas for the solar and electronics industries with manufacturing facilities in Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana, USA.[14]
REC Solar continues to manufacture wafers, solar cells, and solar panels at its fully automated integrated manufacturing facility in Singapore, plus EPC services and solutions in select markets.[15]
Both companies continued to be headquartered in Norway (with different management, separate organization setup, operations, etc.), and both were listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange; REC Silicon kept the ticker symbol “REC” and REC Solar was spun off and newly listed with the ticker symbol “RECSOL” in 2013. REC Solar was de-listed from the Oslo Stock Exchange shortly after being acquired in 2015 by the Elkem Group in Norway.[16]
As part of the split, REC Solar maintained the “REC Group” name, logo, and all other brand elements.
Today, REC Group and REC Silicon have no direct relation other than REC Silicon being a supplier to REC Group.
