News About Dynex Products
07 June 2011


Dynex Semiconductor Limited (“Dynex”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynex Power Inc. CSR Times Electric Co Ltd acquired a majority share in Dynex Power Inc in October 2008. CSR Times Electric also has a power semiconductor business, the Power Electronics Business Unit (“PEBU”), based in China. 
Since 2008, Dynex and PEBU have been jointly working to rationalise their product offerings in order to enhance the business opportunities offered through synergy. It is envisaged that the consolidated product and market strategy will allow both companies to be more responsive to customer requirements. In this context, we would like to advise that in the market outside China mainland the following changes will take place in the forthcoming months: 1. Brand Integration
From the 1st July 2011, products from Dynex and CSR Times Electric will be marketed with a common nomenclature under the Dynex brand. The two companies are co-operating on quality assurance and quality control with a regular exchange of information on quality monitoring. In this way, the products of both manufacturing operations will be enhanced.
2. Product Rationalisation on Rectifier Diodes and Phase Control Thyristors
CSR Times Electric will, in future, manufacture its existing range of rectifier diodes and phase control thyristors below 3.5kV and Dynex will produce its portfolio of devices above this rating. Both ranges will be branded as Dynex.
3. Sales Channel Integration
CSR Times Electric USA will be responsible for sales and marketing for products from both CSR Times Electric and Dynex in the Americas. All enquiries and orders should be addressed there from 1st June 2011. Dynex will be responsible for sales and marketing of products from both CSR Times Electric and Dynex for the rest of the world (excluding China mainland). All enquiries and orders from this region should be addressed there from 1st June, 2011.
CSR Times Electric will continue to be responsible for selling and marketing the products of both CSR Times Electric and Dynex in mainland China.

Dynex Power Inc.
To view and obtain financial information and documents please visit the Dynex Power Inc. website at http://www.dynexpower.com/
Introduction to the Dynex Group
Dynex Power Inc. was formed in Ottawa, Canada on June 15th, 1999 and is quoted on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol DNX. The Company has one subsidiary, Dynex Semiconductor Limited, which is wholly-owned and based in Lincoln, England. The Company and its subsidiary are engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of industrial power equipment. Apart from a few administrative activities carried out by Dynex Power Inc., all the business of the Group is carried out by Dynex Semiconductor Limited. In 2008, Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric Co., Ltd (“CSR Times Electric”) acquired approximately 75% of the share capital of the Company and thus became the Company’s immediate parent company. In 2016 CSR Times Electric changed its name to Zhuzhou CRRC Times Electric Co., Ltd. CRRC Times Electric is itself majority owned by CRRC Corporation Limited which is, therefore, the Company’s ultimate parent company. Both CRRC Times Electric and the CRRC Corporation Limited are established in the People’s Republic of China and are themselves quoted companies.
Dynex’s Business and Strategy
The Group also provides advice and assistance, primarily to CRRC Times Electric, on matters relating to semiconductor design and manufacture.
All the activities of the Group described above take place in a single factory in Lincoln, England often using common facilities and shared staff. Consequently, the Group regards bipolar discrete, power modules and die, power electronic assemblies, and the provision of advice as separate product groups for revenue analysis but does not regard them as separate operating segments for reporting purposes. The Group does not analyse gross margins, expenses, taxation, net profit or assets by product group.
Due to the nature of silicon wafer fabrication, there is a relatively high level of fixed costs in the business. Consequently, the profitability of the business is particularly responsive to the volume of production and, therefore, the overall level of revenue.
Management does not regard the business as seasonal. In the case of Power Assemblies, small numbers of large contracts drive revenues. The delivery of a large contract in a particular quarter can cause revenue to fluctuate significantly, giving the appearance of seasonality.
