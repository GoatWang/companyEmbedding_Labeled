1988年在微芯科技成為獨立公司前，內建蘋果桌上型匯流排協定可預先程式化功能的微晶片科技舊型PIC16CR54，使用於麥金塔第二代電腦中。


微芯科技股份有限公司（英语：Microchip Technology Inc.，英文簡寫：Microchip），是一個美國微控制器、記憶體與類比半導體製造商。它的產品包含微控制器（PIC微控制器、dsPIC / PIC24、PIC32）、序列式EEPROM、序列式SRAM、KEELOQ元件、無線電頻率（RF）元件、熱元件、功率與電池管理類比元件，也有線性、介面與混合信號元件。還有一些介面元件包含USB、ZigBee/MiWi，CANbus與Ethernet。
公司總部位於亞利桑那州錢德勒，晶圓廠則分別位於亞利桑那州坦佩及奧勒岡州格雷斯罕（英语：Gresham, Oregon）。
主要的競爭者有亞德諾半導體、愛特梅爾、飛思卡爾（分拆自摩托羅拉）、英飛凌、美信整合產品、恩智浦半導體（分拆自飛利浦）、瑞薩電子、意法半導體與德州儀器。
歷史[编辑]
1987年，通用儀器將其微電子部門分拆出來，並成立一個獨資擁有的子公司。[2]1989年，此子公司被一群創業投資者併購後，微芯科技就成為一家獨立公司，並且於1993年上市。[3]
2009年4月，微芯科技發表了微瓦XLP微控制器（世界最低睡眠電流）。[4]
2009年時，微晶片科技已經賣出超過60億顆微控制器。[5]
2010年4月，微芯科技併購硅存储科技（SST），[6]同年5月，將若干SST快閃記憶體的資產售予綠色鏈接系統（英语：Greenliant Systems）。[7]
截至2011年，每年微晶片科技賣出超過10億顆處理器。
2011年9月，微芯科技賣出第100億顆PIC微處理器。[8]
2012年8月，微芯科技併購標準微系統公司（英语：SMSC）（SMSC）。[9]
2016年1月，微芯科技宣布以35.6億美元收購Atmel。[10]

1988年在微芯科技成為獨立公司前，內建蘋果桌上型匯流排協定可預先程式化功能的微晶片科技舊型PIC16CR54，使用於麥金塔第二代電腦中。


微芯科技股份有限公司（英语：Microchip Technology Inc.，英文簡寫：Microchip），是一個美國微控制器、記憶體與類比半導體製造商。它的產品包含微控制器（PIC微控制器、dsPIC / PIC24、PIC32）、序列式EEPROM、序列式SRAM、KEELOQ元件、無線電頻率（RF）元件、熱元件、功率與電池管理類比元件，也有線性、介面與混合信號元件。還有一些介面元件包含USB、ZigBee/MiWi，CANbus與Ethernet。
公司總部位於亞利桑那州錢德勒，晶圓廠則分別位於亞利桑那州坦佩及奧勒岡州格雷斯罕（英语：Gresham, Oregon）。
主要的競爭者有亞德諾半導體、愛特梅爾、飛思卡爾（分拆自摩托羅拉）、英飛凌、美信整合產品、恩智浦半導體（分拆自飛利浦）、瑞薩電子、意法半導體與德州儀器。
歷史[编辑]
1987年，通用儀器將其微電子部門分拆出來，並成立一個獨資擁有的子公司。[2]1989年，此子公司被一群創業投資者併購後，微芯科技就成為一家獨立公司，並且於1993年上市。[3]
2009年4月，微芯科技發表了微瓦XLP微控制器（世界最低睡眠電流）。[4]
2009年時，微晶片科技已經賣出超過60億顆微控制器。[5]
2010年4月，微芯科技併購硅存储科技（SST），[6]同年5月，將若干SST快閃記憶體的資產售予綠色鏈接系統（英语：Greenliant Systems）。[7]
截至2011年，每年微晶片科技賣出超過10億顆處理器。
2011年9月，微芯科技賣出第100億顆PIC微處理器。[8]
2012年8月，微芯科技併購標準微系統公司（英语：SMSC）（SMSC）。[9]
2016年1月，微芯科技宣布以35.6億美元收購Atmel。[10]

1988年在微晶片科技成為獨立公司前，內建蘋果桌上型匯流排協定可預先程式化功能的微晶片科技舊型PIC16CR54，使用於麥金塔第二代電腦中。


微晶片科技股份有限公司（英語：Microchip Technology Inc.，英文簡寫：Microchip），是一個美國微控制器、記憶體與類比半導體製造商。它的產品包含微控制器（PIC微控制器、dsPIC / PIC24、PIC32）、序列式EEPROM、序列式SRAM、KEELOQ元件、無線電頻率（RF）元件、熱元件、功率與電池管理類比元件，也有線性、介面與混合信號元件。還有一些介面元件包含USB、ZigBee/MiWi，CANbus與Ethernet。
公司總部位於亞利桑那州錢德勒，晶圓廠則分別位於亞利桑那州坦佩及奧勒岡州格雷斯罕（英語：Gresham, Oregon）。
主要的競爭者有亞德諾半導體、愛特梅爾、飛思卡爾（分拆自摩托羅拉）、英飛凌、美信整合產品、恩智浦半導體（分拆自飛利浦）、瑞薩電子、意法半導體與德州儀器。
歷史[編輯]
1987年，通用儀器將其微電子部門分拆出來，並成立一個獨資擁有的子公司。[2]1989年，此子公司被一群創業投資者併購後，微晶片科技就成為一家獨立公司，並且於1993年上市。[3]
2009年4月，微晶片科技發表了微瓦XLP微控制器（世界最低睡眠電流）。[4]
2009年時，微晶片科技已經賣出超過60億顆微控制器。[5]
2010年4月，微晶片科技併購矽儲存科技（SST），[6]同年5月，將若干SST快閃記憶體的資產售予綠色鏈接系統（英語：Greenliant Systems）。[7]
截至2011年，每年微晶片科技賣出超過10億顆處理器。
2011年9月，微晶片科技賣出第100億顆PIC微處理器。[8]
2012年8月，微晶片科技併購標準微系統公司（英語：SMSC）（SMSC）。[9]
2016年1月，微晶片科技宣布以35.6億美元收購Atmel。[10]

A History of Innovation
Microchip's desire for continuous improvement has led to several industry firsts that have moved embedded design forward.

Streamlined Product Development – With its innovation in graphical configuration tools such as MPLAB® Code Configurator and Atmel® Start, Microchip has worked to significantly shorten our customers' development times.

Analog Integration – Recognizing the opportunity to eliminate componentry on our customers' PCBs, Microchip began offering the first general-purpose MCU family with commonly used analog modules integrated on chip to reduce size and cost.

Core Independence – The Event System and Core Independent Peripherals were developed around the concept that repetitive embedded tasks can be handled more efficiently and deterministically with highly configurable on-chip hardware modules.  This allows our 8-bit MCUs to outperform 32-bit MCUs when handling common tasks, while offering our customers a simple configuration experience.
