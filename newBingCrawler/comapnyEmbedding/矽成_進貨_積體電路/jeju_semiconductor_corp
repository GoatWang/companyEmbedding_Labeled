Since EMLSI made a debut to the SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) market in 2001 with 4M SRAM, EMLSI continued implementing full lineup of low power SRAM products through 1M, 2M, 4M to 8M SRAM.
EMLSI's SRAM is built on robust 6-transistor memory cell technology that enables fast access time at very low power consumption. EMLSI's SRAM products have been recognized as the most robust low power memory solutions that can steadily operates under any rigor of the environment a mobile cellular handset may go through. EMLSI has been recognized by world leading cellular handset manufacturer as one of the most reliable SRAM manufacturers. In addition to the handheld mobile applications, EMLSI provides SRAM products for the entirety of SRAM applications over the world.
In 2004, EMSLI has further expanded SRAM product lineup to 16M and 32M PSRAM (Pseudo Static Random Access Memory). As cellular communications become widely popular over the globe, sophistication of cellular phone functions pushes the memory size demand beyond the traditional SRAM densities. EMLSI has developed and successfully introduced DRAM technology based SRAM products called PSRAM.

Product Detail Information
Features
Armed with world-class competitiveness, EMLSI has gained its prestige as a company specialized in memory chips. Now, we focus more on mobile memory chips based on successful advancements.
High Speed, High Density, and Low Power TechnologyUnlike a DRAM requiring accumulated electric charge in capacitor, an SRAM consists of Flip-Flop circuits and two transistors only, hence no need for "Refreshment" and electricity for "Refreshment" process.
Therefore, an SDRAM eats up less electricity to retain data, an ideal quality for mobile phones. Since active diodes in SRAM memory cells allow fast data transfer, they can also be aptly used as cache memory for high-capacity, high-powered computers such as engineering workstations or super computers.
Technical reliability of our power-saving SRAMs has already been proven in many field tests by major clients. EMLSI has a production system that can provide customers with complete line-up of 1M ~ 8M Low-Power SRAMs armed particularly with full CMOS process technology, which excels in low-power activation and saving electricity. We also adopt BGA, Ball Grid Array, method to our chips to shorten data transfer routes, cut down on power-consumption even further, increase transfer speed, and thus cater customer demands for lighter, thinner, shorter and smaller devices.
