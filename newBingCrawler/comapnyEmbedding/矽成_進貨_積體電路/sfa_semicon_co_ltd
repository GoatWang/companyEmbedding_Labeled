	SFA Semicon Co Ltd operates in the Semiconductors and related devices sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares SFA Semicon Co Ltd with three other
	
			companies in this sector in South Korea:
		
	Nepes Corporation
	
		(2016
	sales of 254.54 billion Korean Won [US$227.30  million]
		of which 66%
		was Semiconductor),
	
	S-Energy Co Ltd
	
		(304.64 billion Korean Won [US$272.04  million]
		of which 100%
		was Solar Cells), and
	
	Lumens Co Limited
	
		(402.84 billion Korean Won [US$359.74  million]
		of which 130%
		was LED Segment).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	SFA Semicon Co Ltd reported sales of 429.21 billion Korean Won (US$383.29 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 16.9%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 516.48 billion Korean Won.
	
		The sales level in 2016 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2011, SFA Semicon Co Ltd had sales
		of 463.51 billion Korean Won.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 19.6% decline
		in Package Segment, from 463.90 billion Korean Won to 373.08 billion Korean Won.
		.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Card Segment (up 6.8% to 56.13 billion Korean Won)

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
