Server Management
In the rapidly emerging Internet era, the underlying building blocks are formed by vast amount of servers. Hence, the management necessities for these servers become fundamental requirement. The goal in implementing server management strategy is simple, which is to minimize and prevent issues that lead to extensive downtime, and reduce IT maintenance costs. The means to do so will require autonomous monitoring and recovery with remote management capabilities. In order to fulfill the needs of server management, Intel leads the IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) specification, which the core of management is provided by base board management controller. 
ASPEED Server Management product lines are designed to enrich the basic feature set with 2D graphic controller, hardware monitoring capabilities, and iKVM function.  Customer can select and implement from our Graphics & Remote Management Processors to best fit their design needs. 
PC/AV Extensions
Evolving from monochrome display to  High Definition, multimedia information delivery is transforming our lives in every aspect. From office to factory floor, home to in flight entertainment. All of which now requires display connections and extensions. With the increasing usage scenarios that demands distance extension with multimedia information delivery, our PC/AV Extension solutions are design to address the market demands. 
Our core technology includes 
Display over IP
USB over IP
Audio over IP
With our core technologies, we are able to support PC Extensions for application scenario such as PC-to-TV, PC centralization for Internet Cafe, and Enterprise PC over IP.
Also, our support for AV Extensions not only includes 1-to-1 AV Extenders, but also multi-input to multi-output AV extension with High Definition content.
Desktop Virtualization
Nowadays more and more corporates are building their own desktop virtualization infrastructures (VDI) in order to ensure information security, reduce IT management efforts, better utilize hardware resources, save electricity, etc. For VDI application, it’s very important that the responses of the thin or zero clients are quick enough so that the users feel like using personal computers.
To realize the seamless transition to VDI, Aspeed brings to the world the revolutionary thin/zero client SoC. The solution is particularly designed with hardware accelerators to fortify performance while still achieves low power consumption and low costs from the benefits of ARM architecture. On the other hand, Aspeed provides total solutions in terms of chip, firmware, and reference design, which can help customers shorten the time to the market.

With today’s powerful PCs, much of the computing power is wasted. Not only is a waste of money, but also leaving a big footprint in the environment. Sharing the computing resource of one desktop PC by multiple users has become highly feasible and smart. Enabling by Microsoft’s latest RDP7.1, and the new RemoteFX compression technology, ASPEED is designing a powerful Remote Fx Client Processor, AST3100. AST3100 can be design to work in the “Windows Enterprise Server” domain. It will be a complete system solution with Microsoft OS support, to bring enterprise/personal cloud computing within everyone’s reach. AST3100 will be a full featured Ultra Thin Client replacement and a new revolution standard for Zero client. Enterprise/Personal Users, can virtualized the power of a single server to many Virtual Machines, and increase overall productivity without the extensive cost.AST3100 is ASPEED's first virtual desktop processor to support Microsoft Remote FX 7.1 standard hardware decode. With pure hardwired hardware decoder, it can support up to 1920x1200 resolution at 30 frame per second with single DDR3 DRAM configuration. By integrating powerful hardwire hardware decoder, it is embedded with 400MHz CPU to reduce power consumption so no heat sink nor fan is needed. The chip power consumption is optimized to less then 1.5W when running full-HD decode and can be reduced to 100mW when power saving mode is on. ASPEED AST3100 can provide the best performance, cost effective and low power consumption for Microsoft RemoteFX 7.1 client solution.FeaturesRemoteFX 7.1 decoderUp to 1920x1200 resolution Support USB redirectionSupport audio redirectionSupport 10/100/1000M bps MACDDR2/DDR3 800Mbps 16-bit bus SupportCPU ARM9 @ 400MHz.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
