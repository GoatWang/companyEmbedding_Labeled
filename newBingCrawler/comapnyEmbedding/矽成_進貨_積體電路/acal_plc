     ACAL Acquires Plitron Manufacturing | Plitron Manufacturing                                               1-416-667-9914 sales@plitron.com   Terms of Sale Noratel Contacts E Catalog                 Select Page                      ACAL Acquires Plitron Manufacturing Mar 3, 2016   Trading Update and North American Acquisition 12 Feb 2016 Acal plc (LSE: ACL, “Acal” or “the Group”), a leading international supplier of customised electronics to industry, today issues a trading update for the year ending 31 March 2016, covering the 4 months period from 1 October 2015 to 31 January 2016, and announces the acquisition of Plitron Manufacturing Inc (“Plitron”). Trading update During the 4 months ended 31 January 2016, the Group performed in line with our expectations. In the Design & Manufacturing division, sales increased by 26% CER. Like-for-like2 growth continued at levels similar to the first half of the current financial year. In the Custom Distribution division, ongoing sales3 were flat, with Continental Europe growing at levels similar to organic rates in the D&M division while the UK remained in decline. As indicated at the time of our first half results announcement, overall sales growth in Custom Distribution was impacted by the strong prior year comparator arising primarily from a few large one-off customer orders. Gross margin remains firm and ahead of last year. Flux A/S, which was acquired on 5 November 2015 for an initial consideration of £3.7m, and Contour Electronics, which was acquired on 8 January 2016 for an initial consideration of £17.0m, are performing as expected. Whilst mindful of the current uncertain economic and market conditions, we maintain our earnings forecast for the full year. Acquisition of Plitron Manufacturing Inc Plitron, based in Toronto, Canada, is a designer and manufacturer of custom toroidal transformers for transportation, medical and industrial applications. With a well established track record of supplying high quality, custom-engineered magnetic products in North America, the business will further develop the Group’s international capabilities and is expected to generate new cross-selling opportunities. Plitron will operate within Acal’s Design & Manufacturing division (“D&M”) whilst retaining its distinct brand identity. For further information please contact: Acal plc Nick Jefferies – Group Chief Executive Simon Gibbins – Group Finance Director 01483 544 500 Instinctif Partners Mark Garraway Helen Tarbet James Gray 020 7457 2020 Notes 1. Growth rates refer to the comparable prior year period. 2. Like-for-like growth for the Group is calculated at constant exchange rates, including the pre-acquisition periods of the Noratel Group and Foss Group which were acquired last year (on 17 July 2014 and 7 January 2015 respectively), but excluding the recent acquisitions of Flux A/S and Contour Electronics. 3. Ongoing sales exclude large, non-repeating orders from last year and sales of its final major non-specialist, low margin supplier, which was discontinued last year. 4. This trading update is based upon unaudited management accounts and has been prepared solely to provide additional information on trading to the shareholders of Acal plc. It should not be relied on by any other party for other purposes. Certain statements made in this update are forward-looking statements. Such statements have been made by the Directors in good faith using information available up until the date that they approved this update. Forward-looking statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks.

Custom manufacturing




Whether we have produced your design for you or you have done this separately, we can provide manufacturing, supply chain and quality management services for your project.
We offer:
low-volume production (from one piece or for one-off projects) 
mass production (including quality assurance, production planning and safety stock)
rapid prototyping, and
after-sales support (including obsolescence management if required).
Our manufacturing centres are approved to ISO9001:2015 CECC and IECQ standards. For more details see our Quality policy information.




Supply chain and quality management services
Our design matches your end product and its environment as well as your processes. Our packaging, including documentation and labelling is matched with your assembling technology. We choose the best manufacturing site globally, depending on size, weight, volume, cost considerations and delivery area. Our warehouse capabilities include stock profiles, safety stocks, consignment stocks, shipping on demand, drop shipments, and just in time.
Final quality checks are managed by our central quality department. We are your direct partner for quality assurance agreements, audits and complaint management, and take full responsibility for each delivery independent of the production site. Testing is carried out in our own lab using modern semi-automatic equipment. In addition to standard defined parameter tests, we also offer other examinations on request.
To ensure the highest quality level of production and conformity with required standards (ISO, RoHS, REACH, UL), our central quality management team provide full support and perform audits at our production sites.

The Acal Group own a network of production plants across Europe and Asia. Typically prototypes, samples and low-volume requirements are produced in-house. High volume production is done by specialist manufacturing partners, who have implemented European measures of process stability, product quality and general management.  We can find the best way to produce your project.
