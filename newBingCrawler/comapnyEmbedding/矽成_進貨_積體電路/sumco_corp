Product Lineup
SUMCO provides high-quality silicon wafers supporting the semiconductor industry at the leading edge. Raw materials with the highest level of quality are used as the silicon wafer material. The wafers are produced under the strictest quality control to create products meeting customer needs in all kinds of ways.


Made from the finest raw materials, for quality that can be counted on
Monocrystalline Ingot

The silicon wafers provided by SUMCO are made from high-purity monocrystalline silicon ingots, manufactured by the CZ (Czochralski) crystal growth process. Ingots up to 300mm in diameter are manufactured under the highest level of quality control.
If required by customers, we also make use of the MCZ (Magnetic Czochralski) technique, applying a strong magnetic field to the molten silicon, or the FZ (Float-Zone) technique whereby monocrystalline ingots are grown at low oxygen levels without using a quartz crucible.


Ultra-flat, ultra-clean wafers produced under strict quality control
Polished Wafer (PW)

A monocrystalline ingot is sliced to thicknesses of around 1mm and the surfaces are polished to a mirror finish. As a result, the wafers are exceptionally flat and clean. SUMCO can also add gettering capability to the wafer, by which heavy metal impurities that can degrade electrical properties are captured.


Wafers with improved surface crystal perfection thanks to high-temperature annealing
Annealed Wafer (AW)

A polished wafer undergoes high-temperature annealing in an atmosphere of hydrogen or argon, removing oxygen near the wafer surface. The resulting wafer has improved crystal perfection.


Wafers with a vapor phase growth layer of monocrystalline silicon
Epitaxial Wafer (EW)

For superior quality, the surface layer of the polished wafer is formed from monocrystalline silicon using vapor phase growth, or epitaxy.


Wafers with a layer for embedding integrated circuits
Junction Isolated Wafer (JIW)

First the customer’s design is followed to form an embedding layer for integrated circuits on the surface of the wafer employing photolithography, ion implantation, and thermal diffusion techniques. An epitaxial layer is then formed on top of this layer.


Wafers with an oxide layer under the active layer for higher integration
Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) Wafer

An oxide layer with high electric insulation is sandwiched between two polished wafers, which are then bonded together. This enables devices with high integration, low power consumption, high speed, and high reliability. A diffusion layer of arsenic (As) or antimony (Sb) can also be formed in the active layer at the wafer surface.


Wafers can be recycled on request
Reclaimed Polished Wafer (RPW)
On customer request, used wafers can be taken back and recycled for reuse.

                                  facilities in the United States. As a supplier 
                                  to some of the giants in the electronics industry, 
                                  SUMCO provides a full range of products and 
                                  services to support our customers' global operations 
                                  and technology needs. These services include 
                                  Research & Development on new technologies 
                                  and product applications, worldwide inventory 
                                  and product delivery management for customers, 
                                  and an Internet-based customer information system 
                                  that gives customers access to status reports 
                                  and detailed technical information about their 
                                  orders at any time, from anywhere in the world.
SUMCO  is committed 
to being the preeminent silicon wafer supplier to the leaders 
of the global semiconductor industry. That's why we have 
invested the time and energy to implement ISO/TS 16949, ISO 
14001 and QS 9000 management systems at all of our facilities, 
to ensure that we produce the highest quality wafers possible 
with minimum environmental impact. 
Guiding 
Principles
 


We strive for excellence 
                                      in every aspect of our business - products and services, 
                                      client relationships, employee teamwork and corporate performance. 
                                    
We focus on continuous improvement. 
                                      We are always looking for better ways to do things, and we 
                                      rely on our employees to help identify improvements. 
We 
                                      are committed to maintaining a healthy, safe and clean environment 
                                      for our employees, and we have programs in place to assure 
                                      this. 
We believe in good corporate 
                                      citizenship. Globally, that means treating our customers 
                                      with respect and operating with honesty and integrity. Locally, 
                                      it also means protecting and enhancing the environment and 
                                      communities in which we work and live. We do this through 
                                      responsible environmental management programs, volunteerism, 
                                      and corporate and employee contributions to organizations 
                                      that enrich our communities.
