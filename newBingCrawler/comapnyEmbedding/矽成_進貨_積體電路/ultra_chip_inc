Medical Ultrasound Imaging System







The ultrasound image is formed by applying the electrical pulses to the ultrasound transducers. The transducers convert the electrical pulses to ultrasound waves. By applying the acoustic coupling agents such as ultrasound gel between the ultrasound transducer probe surface and the skin, the sound waves propagate into the tissue beneath and to the parts that need to be imaged. When the sound waves hit a boundary between tissues, part of the sound waves get reflected back to the transducer while some sound waves propagate further until they hit another tissue boundary and get reflected. By receiving and processing the echoes, the 2D image of the internal organs and structures can be formed.


Medical ultrasound imaging systems provide a non-invasive way to diagnose a variety of diseases and conditions without the use of radiation. In the past decade, the medical ultrasound imaging systems had been evolved from the traditional large size trolley-based system to more light-weight & portable system. The new light-weight and portable systems are often battery-powered and they are often used in the Point-of-Care and EMED application. The trend in system miniaturization drives the need of low-power and highly integrated ultrasound analog front-end ICs.
Microchip Technology offers the complete solution in the analog front-end circuit for medical ultrasound. Microchip’s medical ultrasound components include: High Voltage Analog Switch, Integrated High Voltage Transmitter, High voltage FET and FET Array, FET Driver, Arbitrary Waveform Generator, and T/R Switch.

LED Products - LED Chips




SemiLEDs MvpLED chips are metal alloy devices which are made using a patented process entailing a vertical structure. This unique approach provides superior performance at various levels.

Thermal benefits: The thermal benefits enable better thermal designs, light color consistency, better lifetime and reliability 
  Efficiency benefits: The vertical structure and copper alloy p-pad, enable lower forward voltages, and better current spreading that make for better overall efficiency
  Optical benefits: The light extraction layer and the thin structure provide a directional light output with a Lambertian pattern enabling better optical coupling and maximizing usable light  
SemiLEDs chips also feature:

Best of breed Brightness and Reliability
  Patented structure 
  Silver epoxy die attach compatibility (140µm high p-n junction)
  Thin chip - 145µm
  Available with SnCu eutectic solder
  RoHS compliant

				              The purpose of Slider Kit is to gather common slideshow-like jQuery functionalities (such as news sliders, photos galleries/sliders, carousels, tabs menus)
				            

				              When tracking mouse movement, you usually need to know the actual position of the mouse pointer. The event object that is passed to the handler contains some information about the mouse coordinates.

Once the FBI has a back door into your smartphone, everyone does


FBI director James Comey said this week that tech companies should not be allowed to put cryptographic locks on mobile devices so they can't be accessed by U.S. intelligence agencies. Comey, speaking at the Brookings Institute yesterday, criticized reactions by Apple and Google in the post-Edward Snowden era to offer encryption on iPhone and Android smartphones.
