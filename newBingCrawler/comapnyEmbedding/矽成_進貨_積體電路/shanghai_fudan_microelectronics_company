ASIC Manufacturer

As people do more and more of their private work online—from banking to accessing medical and school records to saving important documents on the web—they need secure and reliable IC card chips. The smart card industry is one of the most important and fastest growing in the world, and Fudan Microelectronics has become a leading Chinese manufacturer of smart card chips.  Our engineers design IC card chips, SIM card chips, serial EEPROM, flash memory, and application-specific integrated circuits. Fudan is deeply invested in the development of the smart card industry and so have co-founded the IC Engineering Technology Center and the SOC Laboratory as well as helped form a Global Technology R&D Network with centers in North America and Europe.

Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Licenses ARM7TDMI Core For Media Processors In Consumer Electronics Product






17 December 2003




CAMBRIDGE UK – Dec. 17, 2003 – ARM  [LSE: ARM; Nasdaq: ARMHY], the industry’s leading provider of 16/32-bit embedded RISC processor solutions, today announced that Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Ltd. has licensed ARM7TDMI® microprocessor core through the ARM® Foundry Program.  Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics will use ARM core technology to develop a power-efficient, low-cost media processor for audio and imaging solutions in the consumer electronics market that will be manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).
“The ability to combine the technical benefits of reduced die size and power consumption of the ARM7TDMI core, with SMIC’s manufacturing capabilities which enable decreased time-to-market, will have a significant impact in helping us achieve our business goals,” said Lei Shi, chief executive officer of Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Co. “We considered a number of options for our media processors, however ARM industry-proven technology was able to address all of our needs.”  
“The licensing of the ARM7TDMI core to Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics demonstrates the value that ARM brings to fabless and foundry organizations in 
China
 through its flexible and competitive Foundry Program,” said Jun Tan, president, ARM 
China
 . “By licensing ARM intellectual property (IP), Chinese organizations can quickly and efficiently take advantage of the rapidly growing consumers electronics market, which is significantly impacting the dynamics of the semiconductor industry.”
“Access to ARM IP through innovative business programs such the ARM Foundry Program, helps Integrated Circuit (IC) design house in 
China
 achieve and maintain a leading position in the regional semiconductor market place,” said Dr James Sung, vice president of Marketing and Sales of SMIC.  “Our cooperation with ARM provides Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics with a competitive advantage in its effort to deliver proven, world-quality silicon solutions.”
Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics will begin shipping ARM core-based products in Q3 2004.

architecting a secure and
connected world












We Are the Architects of Tomorrow
Arm defines the pervasive computing shaping today’s connected world. Realized in 100 billion silicon chips, our device architectures orchestrate the performance of the technology transforming our lives — from smartphones to supercomputers, from medical instruments to agricultural sensors, and from base stations to servers.












A global ecosystem of innovators
The foundation of a global ecosystem of technology innovators, we empower the world’s most successful business and consumer brands. Every day our thousands of partners embed more than 45 million Arm-based chips in products that connect people, enhance the human experience, and make anything possible. Extensible, scalable, and ever evolving, it is a foundation that confirms how we lead by design — to serve today, anticipate tomorrow.







 












Company Highlights

World’s leading semiconductor IP company
Arm technologies reach 80% of the global population
More than 4,800 employees from 61 nationalities
More than 100 billion Arm-based chips shipped to date

Our People
Arm was founded by a dozen engineers working from a converted barn in Cambridge, UK, a quarter of a century ago. By the end of 2015, that team had grown to more than 4,200 people in sites around the world. Arm gives its people the capabilities, processes and infrastructure to enable them to develop and thrive as the business scales and strengthens. At the same time, we seek to nurture a work culture that remains true to our founders’ original vision; empowering our engineers to be innovative and drive Arm-based technology into all areas where compute happens, maximizing their creative potential and enabling all of our people to be their brilliant selves.
Arm Careers













BBC micro:bit
Arm worked with its technology Partners and the BBC on the micro:bit, a pocket-sized device that’s being given free to every 12 year old in the UK to engage youngsters in computer coding.











Literacy Bridge
Literacy Bridge saves lives and improves the livelihoods of impoverished families through comprehensive programs that provide on-demand access to locally relevant knowledge. At the heart of the program is the Talking Book, an innovative low-cost audio computer.











UNICEF
Our strategic partnership with UNICEF began in May 2015 with a program that has shown how wearable technology can change children’s lives for the better. We are also working with UNICEF on its technology platform, U-Report, which supports 1.7 million young people across Africa.
