Company Description                    




                        Zenitron was founded in October 1982 by Mr. Gary Y.Y. Chou, and is one of the trailblazers in Taiwan's semiconductor components distribution industry. The main operation is in Greater China, focusing on Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong. The sales and service functions spread across four domains: power management, networking & telecommunications, consumer electronics and retail channel. The environmental evolution at the consumer's end means electronics' different development categories are now more diverse, complicate and innovation-oriented. Mr. Chou foresees this trend will exceed the traditional distributor's role of buy and sell, and devotes to become a value-added distributor with leading technology. Aside from selling components, Zenitron provides clients Turnkey solutions and design consultations service. Such service assists clients integrating resources, lower R&D time and expenses, so Zenitron's clients could launch the products to the market at faster speed. Today, Zenitron has rich and fruitful experiences in SMPS, Digital Still Camera, LCD-TV, MP3 and so on. To expand the market share, on December 31st of 2005, Zenitron consolidated Princeton Technology C&C Group and obtained main product lines such as SanDisk and Cypress. This strengthens the competitive edge of Zenitron in IT, communication, and consumer electronics. The consolidation also combines two companies' multi product lines, both at the up stream and the consumer end's memory card market. This helps the expansion of market and provides more solutions. Zenitron was listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange Operation in August, 2002 (Taiwanese stock: 3028). Zenitron has nearly 20 operation points in Greater China.
