AVID Electronics Selects LSI Logic ZSP400 DSP Core and ZSP Multimedia Platform For Portable Consumer Products


ZSP400 and ZSP Multimedia Platform selected for best performance and lowest power, which are ideal for cost-sensitive consumer electronics market segment (http://www.zsp.com/applications/multimedia.html) AVID Electronics gets to market quickly with a solution that supports a variety of multimedia compression standards, new features and improved quality and functionality  MILPITAS, Calif.- May 18, 2004 - LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced that AVID Electronics Corp., a leading producer of digital audio/video system products, has selected the ZSP400 DSP core and application software for its next-generation portable multimedia semiconductor products. By adopting the ZSP Multimedia Platform, a DSP-based, licensable and fully certified software and hardware platform for the rapid design of its digital audio/video devices, AVID Electronics is able to reduce time-to-market and realize an easy migration path to support future product plans with maximum technology re-use. The LSI Logic ZSP solutions are especially critical for us in addressing the fast-changing multimedia, multi-format requirements of todays products, said Dr. Ji-Chien Lee, senior vice president, Product Development Center, AVID Electronics Corp. By making use of the ZSP400, an ideal combination of performance, high code density and ease-of-programming along with the flexible ZSP Multimedia Platform, we are able to get to market quickly with a solution that supports a variety of multimedia compression standards, new features and improved quality and functionality." Addressing the increasing demand for multi-format, multimedia solutions in consumer electronic applications, the ZSP Multimedia Platform supports popular audio and video encoding and decoding standards for use in a wide variety of consumer products. The multimedia platform is a licensable and fully certified software and hardware platform for the rapid design of next-generation devices. Based on the ZSP architecture, its combination of extensive software suites and multi-core multi-processor software development tools makes the ZSP Multimedia Platform one of the most comprehensive multimedia solutions in the market. We are delighted that AVID Electronics selected the ZSP400 and the Multimedia Platform for their performance and flexibility, said Caspar Settels, multimedia marketing director for the LSI Logic DSP Division. Licensees of ZSP technology can expect consistent, proven results when integrating the complete IP packages and subsystem designs of the ZSP Multimedia Platform in their home entertainment multimedia products, such as portable audio/video players, set-top boxes, and digital TVs. Addressing Multimedia Requirements The ZSP Multimedia Platform software suite supports popular digital audio/video standards and required multimedia subsystem components. These enhanced audio, imaging and video functions have become essential user requirements, particularly in cell phones, PDAs and portable multimedia devices. In these devices the ZSP DSP performs multimedia tasks more efficiently than using a traditional microcontroller as the application-processor, enabling lower clock rates and smaller system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs, and resulting in longer battery life and lower cost. Time-to-Market To reduce time-to-market, the ZSP Multimedia Platform is compatible with all ZSP digital signal processor cores and the software is compliant with the ZOpen framework. ZOpen enables streamlined application development by providing a standardized integration environment, multi-vendor algorithm interoperability and hardware abstraction. Designers can leverage off-the-shelf algorithms from the rapidly expanding list of leading audio and video application software companies, including Espico Ltd., QSound Labs, Ittiam Systems, Wipro Technologies, and Spatializer Labs. About the LSI Logic ZSP Family of DSP Cores LSI Logic's ZSP DSP superscalar signal processing technology provides the highest performance open architecture DSP cores available today. These licensable and fully synthesizable cores have proven themselves in SoC and standard products alike. For more information about the ZSP DSP family visit the website at http://www.zsp.com or send e-mail to dsp-mkt@zsp.com. For additional information on implementing the ZSP Multimedia Platform in next-generation products, please review Develop multimedia SoC solutions in record time using the ZSP Multimedia Platform available at http://seminar2.techonline.com/~lsilogic44/mar1804/ About LSI Logic Corporation LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) is a leading designer and manufacturer of communications, consumer and storage semiconductors for applications that access, interconnect and store data, voice and video. In addition, the company supplies storage network solutions for the enterprise. LSI Logic is headquartered at 1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035, http://www.lsilogic.com.

Innovative engineering and technology are at the core of what makes a Denon product a Denon.
Simply put, anything that does not provide more passion, improve performance or enhance the experience does not belong in a Denon. We know because we are not just building these products, we are using them. When you actually experience a Denon product, it’s
                                        these higher standards that elevate the senses and enhance your entertainment. That’s the Denon Difference.

For movie buffs, sports fans, music lovers and gamers, the road to a sublime entertainment experience is paved with simplicity. Everything you need is in the box. Instead of mixing and matching components, just unpack your receiver, surround speakers and
                                        subwoofer. Do your senses a favor—connect them all and sit back. Because there are blockbusters that need to be watched, teams that need to be cheered, bands to be discovered, zombies that need to be put away and yes, senses that need to be shaken from their
                                        stupor. You can't afford to spend your days wrapped up in cables and instruction manuals – the world of entertainment needs you. Answer the call of the couch and get closer to your favorite entertainment like never before.

At NuVo we believe in music. It is our commitment to bring the most innovative, highest quality music experience into as many homes as possible at an affordable price. Amplification systems like ours have been available for some time, but only to the extremely
                                        high-end client (with an equally extreme price tag). At NuVo we believe that music is for everyone, and having it in the home in this way is a must. Once you experience it you’ll know what we mean–and you’ll never go back!
Much of what makes this perfect balance of high quality and maximum affordability is that we do this by bringing together the best possible engineering talent and the most efficient manufacturing that can be obtained. Many of our engineers also have strong
                                        music industry backgrounds, giving them a unique sensitivity to sound quality that is just not present at many electronics companies. We pride ourselves on creating audio solutions that experts like these would have in their homes.

Participants voted on products, solutions, strategic direction, and future offerings, to help ensure that Avid is delivering solutions that help solve the most critical issues and support what is most important to our members and their business requirements.
Check out the results and see what Avid is doing to address them by signing into the ACA Portal. Status updates will be provided regularly from Avid.
