Frost & Sullivan Award Commends Thin Film for New Product Innovation
						























The 2010 Frost & Sullivan Global New Product Innovation Award in Printed Electronic Memories is presented to Thin Film Electronics ASA ('Thinfilm'). The company is commended for its unique non-volatile, printable, polymer-based memory products.
"Thin Film Electronics has a clear edge over its competitors in terms of product design based on an innovative technique," notes Frost & Sullivan Research Analyst Sunanda Jayanth. "A key characteristic of the innovative technology is that it is fully printable in high volume roll-to-roll machines. Another advantage of the technology used by Thinfilm is that it is based on nontoxic materials."
The company has developed a specific group of printable polymers that are bi-stable and thus used as the active material in Thinfilm's rewritable non-volatile memory.
"These polymers are 'smart', to the extent that functionality is built into the material itself, like switchability, addressability and charge store," says Jayanth. "This is different from silicon and other electronic materials, where such functions typically are only achieved by complex circuitry. Such 'smart' materials open up tremendous opportunities in the electronics world."
Thinfilm's innovative all-printed, re-writable memories find utilisation in standalone consumer applications, such as interactive, personalised toys and online-enabled cards and games. They can also be integrated with batteries, displays, logic, and sensors for the development of all printed radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Other suitable application areas include authentication, brand protection, in logistics and supply chain automation, and as a general purpose memory.
The prime focus for Thinfilm has been consumer markets and, in particular, the toy and game industry. Thinfilm's product offerings for this market include the Thinfilm MemoryTM, a 20-bit non-volatile rewriteable memory printed in a high-volume roll-to-roll process, and the Thinfilm Memory ControllerTM.
The Thinfilm Memory ControllerTM is an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It will enable toy manufacturers to design smaller, more cost effective reader/writer units, while accelerating the market launch of smart toys powered by Thinfilm.
"The new Thinfilm Memory ControllerTM is expected to further increase the cost efficiency of Thinfilm printed memory compared to alternatives, such as magnetic cards and flash, on a per-chip/per-device basis," remarks Jayanth. "Another key advantage is negligible power consumption during read and write and none during stand-by. These advantages, combined with environmentally-friendly production, make it well suited for application with other printed electronics."
The novel Thinfilm Toy Development Kit includes instructions for programming and other tools needed to efficiently design smart products using Thinfilm Memory. It contains a hand-held reader/writer for memory-labeled cards, samples of the newly developed Thinfilm Memory Controller, and tags with Thinfilm Memory.
Thinfilm also recently announced that it is developing prototypes of higher-density addressable printed memories: Thinfilm Adressable MemoryTM. These prototypes, which combine Thinfilm Memory with printed logic, will be ready later this year. Transfer to production for the addressable memory is expected in 2012.
Each year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in the following categories: innovative element of the product, leverage of leading edge technologies, value added features/benefits, increased customer ROI and customer acquisition/penetration potential.
Frost & Sullivan Best Practices Awards recognise companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis, and extensive secondary research in order to identify best practices in the industry.
About Thin Film Electronics

Thin Film Electronics ASA (Oslo Stock Exchange : THIN) is a Norwegian printed electronics company, headquartered in Oslo with its main R&D offices in Linköping, Sweden and San Jose, California, United States. Thin Film Electronics ASA ("Thinfilm") produces rewriteable non-volatile memories based on ferroelectric polymers using roll-to-roll printing and labels based on Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.
Thinfilm has been developing memories based on polymer materials since 1994; first as part of Opticom ASA and then as an independent company. For the first ten years, the focus was on hybrid memory devices with polymer-based memory and silicon-based control circuitry, as developed jointly with Intel.[1] From 2006, Thinfilm has concentrated its efforts on printed electronics.
Thinfilm successfully demonstrated roll-to-roll printed organic memory in 2009, and was awarded IDTechEx Technical Development Manufacturing Award the same year.[2][3][4][5]
In September 2012, Thinfilm was selected by web 2.0 blog GigaOM as one of its Top 15 Mobile companies that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape in a significant way.[6]
In January 2014 Thinfilm acquired the assets of Kovio and opened the Thinfilm NFC Innovation Center in San Jose.[7]

Technology[edit]
The ferroelectric polymer is sandwiched between two sets of electrodes in a passive matrix. Each crossing of metal lines is a ferroelectric capacitor and defines a memory cell. This gives a non-volatile memory comparable to ferroelectric RAM technologies and offer the same functionality as flash memory.[8]
Thinfilm's patented passive matrix dispenses with the need of active circuitry within the memory cell. It allows the memory to be separate from the read/write electronics enabling stand alone application without integration with printed logic. The passive array memory architecture also enables high density memories as well as the possibility to stack memory layers on top of each other.
The printed memory technology was licensed to Xerox in December 2014 and marketed as of June 2016 as Xerox Printed Memory.[9]
In October 2013, Thinfilm produced the first ever electronically printed stand-alone sensor system. The sensor was built in the form of a temperature tracking label and is expected to go into production in 2014.
Partnerships[edit]
Thinfilm is working with PARC, a subsidiary of Xerox, to combine its memory technology with PARC's printed transistor technology to enable fully printed memory systems.[10][11] In October 2011, Thinfilm together with PARC announced a working prototype of the world's first printed non-volatile memory device addressed with complementary organic circuits, the organic equivalent of CMOS circuitry.[12][13][14]
Thinfilm and PARC announced in June 2012 that they will jointly manufacture a printed temperature sensor tag using Thinfilm's Addressable Memory technology. Both parties are also working together to develop electronic displays that would combine printed sensors, memory modules and batteries.[15][16]
Other printed systems currently in development with Thinfilm and its partners will be used in food manufacturing to monitor temperature of temperature-sensitive fresh produce.[17] The first temperature sensor packaging project to be announced by Thinfilm is a partnership with U.S. packaging giant Bemis Company, the agreement will lead to the development of a flexible sensing platform for the packaging market.[18]
In December 2012, Thinfilm announced that it has entered into a commercial agreement with the American toy and board game company Hasbro, to supply printed electronic components for their range of products.[19]
Awards[edit]
Thinfilm Electronics has won a number of awards for innovation and technical development since first demonstrating roll-to-roll printing of electronics in 2009. In 2010 Frost & Sullivan awarded the New Product Innovation Prize in Printed Electronic Memories to Thinfilm for its unique non-volatile, printable, polymer-based memory products.[20]
In 2012 Thinfilm Electronics was awarded both the IDTechEx Product Development Award and the FlexTech Alliance Innovation Award for its Addressable Memory technology built in association with PARC.[21][22] Also in late 2012, Thinfilm was named as a runner-up in the Wall Street Journal Technology's Innovation Award.[23]
In October 2012 it was announced that the company had won the 2012 World Technology Award for Visionary Contribution to Materials Science and Technology in the development of printed smart tags for the Internet of Things.[24]
