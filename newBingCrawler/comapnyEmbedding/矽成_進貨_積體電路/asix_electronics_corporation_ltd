ASIX Electronics Corp., a leading fabless semiconductor supplier providing innovative USB-to-LAN solutions, recently announced two new additions to the AX88x72 family for embedded Ethernet applications : the AX88772A and AX88172A, for USB-to-Ethernet and USB-to-MII chips, respectively. The AX88x72A is the latest series in ASIX's High-speed USB-to-LAN product portfolio. By combining the AX88x72A with a USB Host microcontroller, designers can provide Ethernet connectivity for embedded systems to distribute data and control remotely over a network.
Recent innovations in multimedia SoC's (System-on-chip) have been based on decreasing the physical form factor to reduce costs. The most efficient method of miniaturization is to decrease the pin count and utilize a serial interface, including SPI flash and USB-LAN solutions, in favor of a parallel local/memory bus. Furthermore, USB's 4-pin serial interface provides transfer speeds up to 480 Mbps, making it an ideal solution for miniature and mobile devices to quickly connect to networking peripherals. ASIX Electronics has released the AX88x72 series USB-LAN chips to satisfy the market demands for networking applications using multimedia SoC's.
The AX88x72A features a USB interface to communicate with a USB Host Controller and is compliant with USB specification V1.1 and V2.0. The AX88x72A implements 10/100Mbps Ethernet LAN function based on IEEE802.3 and IEEE802.3u standards with 24KB of embedded SRAM for packet buffering. In addition, it integrates an on-chip 10/100Mbps Ethernet PHY, simplifying system design. The AX88x72A has a wide array of features including support for HP Auto-MDIX, Wake-on-LAN power management, and IEEE 802.3x/backpressure flow control. Optional serial interfaces such as I2C, SPI, and UART are provided as a control channel from the USB Host Controller to communicate with the external MCU chip.
The AX88772A, low-pin-count (64-pin LQFP) USB 2.0 to 10/100M Fast Ethernet controller, is a high performance and highly integrated ASIC which enables a low cost, small form factor, and simple plug-and-play Fast Ethernet network connection capability for desktops, notebook PC's, UMPC's, cradles/port replicators/docking stations, game consoles, digital-home appliances, and any embedded system using a standard USB port. 
The AX88172A, USB 2.0 to MII controller, provides an optional External Media Interface (EMI) for an external PHY or an external MAC depending on different application purposes. The EMI can be a media-independent interface (MII) for implementing 100BASE-FX Ethernet or HomePNA functions. The EMI can also be a Reverse-MII or Reverse Reduced-MII (Reverse-RMII) for glueless MAC-to-MAC connections to any MCU with Ethernet MAC MII or RMII interface. 
To help customers evaluate and develop applications with the AX88x72A product family, ASIX provides comprehensive technical support including hardware and software application notes, user guides, schematics, PCB layout guides, and drivers for Windows/Linux/WinCE/MacOS operating systems. In addition, ASIX has already received complete USB-IF, WHQL, and RoHS compliant certifications.
Limited samples of the AX88x72A are available now, and volume production is scheduled in October 2007.

Company Description                    




                        Electronics Co., Ltd. was established at 12th May 1995. In August 1997, PCIBUS high-speed Ethernet control chip was certified by Novell, and then the product began mass production. In July 1998, the company launched the control chips of 5-port and 8 port 10/100M network concentrator. In August, the second generation control chip of high-speed Ethernet concentrator started mass production. In December 1998, the company launched the control chip of 10/100MPCMCIA. In June 1999, it pushed off the switch chip of supporting 5-port 10/100M, then the third generation chip of supporting 10/100M in September. In December the PCMCIA control chip with RAM came into market. In August 2000, the company launched three-in-one chip of PCMCIA and LocalBUSMAC. In October, a new factory was completed and the company moved in. In June 2001, Asix pushed off the network control chip of supporting USB1.1, and obtained ISO-9000: 2000 quality management system certification. In February 2002, Asix took the lead to launch network control chip of USB2.0, then in March launched switch chips of 8 and 5 ports GigabitEthernet. Public offering was in April 2002, so the company became a public company officially. In July, Asix obtained ISO-14000 environmental management system certification. In December, it launched innovatively USB2.0 to ISA/PCMCIA/Local Bus Converter chips. In January 2003, the company successfully developed IEEE802.11bWLANMAC control chip. The second generation switch chip of 8 ports GigabitEthernet came into public. In December, Asix completed control chip designing of convertor from USB2.0 Universal Bus to Gigabit Ethernet.
