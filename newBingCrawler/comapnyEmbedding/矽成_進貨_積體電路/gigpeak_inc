Integrated Device Technology, Inc. Announces Acceptance of Shares Tendered into Offer for GigPeak, Inc. 



San Jose, Calif. – (BUSINESS WIRE) – April 4, 2017 – Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (“IDT”; NASDAQ:IDTI) announced today that its tender offer by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Glider Merger Sub, Inc. (“Purchaser”), to purchase all outstanding stock of GigPeak, Inc. (“GigPeak”; NYSE MKT: GIG) at an offer price of $3.08 expired as scheduled at one minute following 11:59 P.M. (12:00 midnight) New York City time, on Monday, April 3, 2017. The tender offer was made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated March 7, 2017, and in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 13, 2017, among IDT, Purchaser and GigPeak (the “Merger Agreement”), which IDT and GigPeak previously announced on February 13, 2017.
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the tender offer, has advised IDT that, as of the expiration of the tender offer, a total of 54,454,085 shares of GigPeak’s common stock were validly tendered in the tender offer representing approximately 80.42% of GigPeak’s then-outstanding shares. The Purchaser has accepted for payment all shares that were validly tendered prior to expiration of the tender offer, and payment for such shares will be made promptly, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer.
IDT intends to effect the merger of the Purchaser with and into GigPeak, with GigPeak surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of IDT, as soon as practicable, in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of capital stock of GigPeak issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares (i) that are owned by or held in the treasury of GigPeak, or owned by IDT or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of IDT or GigPeak or (ii) in respect of which appraisal rights were perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) not validly tendered and purchased in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same per-share price paid in the tender offer, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. Following the merger, IDT intends to cause GigPeak’s common stock to be delisted from the NYSE MKT and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

CES 2017: Everything is About Technology
January 18, 2017
CES 2017 is now in the books and it was a record-breaker, highlighting the continuing growth and infusion of technology into our lives. Attended by more than 175,000 tech professionals from around the globe – with 55,000 coming form outside the US – this year’s gathering attracted individuals from the world’s biggest companies, as well as more than 600 startups. The massive Las Vegas Convention Center was packed as attendees endeavored to visit with a portion of the 3,800+ exhibiting companies occupying more than 2.6 million net square feet of space.
Even if you didn’t attend CES this year, I’m sure you’ve heard plenty of news coming out of this annual tech-fest, as technology has most-certainly gone mainstream. With anything and everything tech-related being touted from the show floor in Las Vegas last week, CES once again didn’t disappoint with news of the practical, unconventional, and sometimes inexplicable.
