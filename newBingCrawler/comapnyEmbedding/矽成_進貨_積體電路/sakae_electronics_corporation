Introduction



 




Sakae was inaugurated in 1946 and founded as a limited liability company in 1950.


We are a Japanese pioneer company of developing and manufacturing Precision Potentiometers.


We expand the development, manufacture and sale of Joystick Controllers, Foot Controllers and Servo Components in addition to Precision Potentiometers and Turns-Counting Dials.

 

We are always mindful of industry trends in electronic components as being "small in size, light in weight, high performance and high reliability".


All of our products protects by over 220 domestic and international patents.

 

In August of 1994, we were certified and approved to ISO 9001 standard by the Reliability Center for Electronic Components of Japan under their registration number RCJ-94M-28 for Precision Potentiometers.


(Since April 1st in 2013, operation of RCJ has been transferred to JQA (General Incorporated Foundation / Japan Quality Assurance Organization) : Certificate number IECQ-P-JQA 13.0004)


We were the first company in Japan to be certified in this field, and we maintain our compliance with an annual certification approval.




 



International Sales Network



 







Thanks to the worldwide approval and recognition of our product's superior quality, our international sales, in particular, to European and North American countries, go on increasing year after year.

TT Electronics, through its BI Technologies brand, has been an innovator and leader in electronic components for 50 years. It has evolved and changed over that time, in form and in name, but most significantly we have retained our innovative spirit. Having introduced our initial range of wound transformers and inductors to the power conversion market in 1987, we have nearly 30 years of experience in the manufacturing of magnetics products.
Our current range of magnetic components includes both power and signal products. We offer a range of transformers, inductors and chokes for applications in transportation and industrial fields.
