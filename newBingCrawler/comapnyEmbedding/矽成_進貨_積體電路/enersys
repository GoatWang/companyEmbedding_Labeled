DataSafe XE Batteries
Engineered for Data Center UPS Applications
DataSafe®  XE batteries by EnerSys®  are the first batteries specifically designed to meet the evolving needs of today's data center power requirements. They provide the power and reliability needed for modern, critical UPS applications.
Improve Data Center Efficiency
Engineered with the most advanced Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) technology and superior manufacturing processes, DataSafe XE batteries support runtimes under 5 minutes. In addition, features such as longer life, lower electric spend for float, and wider operating temperature range result in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) savings of up to 25% compared to conventional monobloc Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries.
