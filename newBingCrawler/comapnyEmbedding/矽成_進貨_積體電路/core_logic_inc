Xilinx solutions enable Smarter Systems through the industry’s broadest lineup of All Programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs and SoCs that set the standard for the low cost, highest performance, and lowest power. Xilinx UltraScale™ architecture delivers unprecedented levels of integration and capability while delivering ASIC-class system level performance for the most demanding applications requiring massive I/O & memory bandwidth, massive data flow, DSP, and packet processing performance. Our break-out portfolio also includes the industry’s only programmable homogeneous and heterogeneous 3D ICs with the highest bandwidth and system integration. In addition, our hardware, software and I/O programmable SoC platform offers the flexibility and scalability of an FPGA combined with ASIC-like performance and power and the ease of use of an ASSP. Learn more about how Xilinx is delivering a generation ahead at 28nm and staying a generation at 16nm.
