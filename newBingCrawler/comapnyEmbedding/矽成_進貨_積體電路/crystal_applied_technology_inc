1 .Sapphire Substrate used for Blue-light/Green-light LED

GaN is the major material used for blue-light/green-light LED. At the early stage of its development, the reason that the researches toward GaN did not show remarkable progress is scientists cannot find substrates matching with its lattice constant.

3 .Other Types of Substrate used in Optronic and Semiconductor Industry

A flock of substrates are used in Optronic -communication and Semiconductor industries. For example, in the category of Optronic -communication, the characteristic, birefringence, of LiNbO3 is use as a chief communication component. For Semiconductor manufacturers, not only silicon wafers but also glass substrates are used as major materials.

6 inch Carrier
Crystalwise Technology Inc. (CWT) continuously develops large size sapphire wafers. Moreover, CWT extends and applies the core technology of wafer processing to manufacturing of essential sapphire 6” carriers used in GaAs Power Amplifiers. Constrained by strict requirements towards precision and difficulty to be processed, the supplies of carriers in Taiwan mostly rely on the imports from Japan and the U.S. CWT devoted itself to developing and manufacturing of carriers and has been verified as a certified GaAs wafer manufacturer; therefore, CWT is able to produce and supply sapphire carriers with high precision.

 Sapphire Heat Spread Substrates
Application & IntroductionSpecification Sapphire Heat Spread Substrates for LED ProductsLED lighting products lead illumination trends of the world. Spectacularly, omni-directional LED products are able to reveal the quality and beauty of LED lighting; therefore, they become manufacturing emphasis in the industry. Commonly, companies use glass as lighting substrates and thin film as circuit. Glass is characterized by translucence; however, its heat dissipation coefficient is about 1.5W/mK, which makes junction temperature of LED too high and thus decreases lighting efficiency and life cycle of products. Also, the use of thin film as circuit raises manufacturing costs. An appropriate solution comes from CWT is that the use of sapphire substrates. Sapphire has several characteristics such as high translucence, good intensity and better heat dissipation coefficient than glasses (20-40W/mK), which make it as a good replacement of filament to be applied to omni-directional LED products.On circuit manufacturing, CWT provides our customers with low-cost and high-efficient product processing. For making of LED lighting engines, CWT offers custmized substrates to our customers as reliable and multiple circuit design solutions to select.SPECProduct images
