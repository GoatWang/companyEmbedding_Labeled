Every year, 11.5 billion dollars of recyclable products are thrown into landfills. 70% of the recoverable material is plastic and is worth over 8 billion dollars.
A forward-thinking group of retail experts recognized that these plastics were a potential revenue stream that was being ignored.
Using innovative technology, Pioneer Products began recovering plastic waste from retail supply chains and creating new consumer products with the reclaimed material.
Pioneer was one of the first to successfully turn waste into new products for retail partners and has increased reclamation every year. Last year, Pioneer converted over 500,000 pounds of plastic into new consumer goods which are sold in retail stores across the United States.
Building on a decade of resounding success within our retail channels and fostered by the amazing retail connectivity offered by our location in Northwest Arkansas, Pioneer expanded into a sales services and marketing agency for other brands looking to solidify their presence on the shelves of retailers and in the minds of consumers.

Provides Sustainable Products to Largest Big Box RetailersMarketwiredOctober 20, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareROGERS, AR--(Marketwired - October 20, 2016) -  Ecoark Holdings, Inc. ("Ecoark") (EARK), a provider of a growing suite of proprietary technologies and services that drive sustainability and facilitate sustainable growth for a wide range of clients, today commented on its continued penetration of the recycled products industry.As highlighted in a recent feature article from Talk Business & Politics, Ecoark has continued to grow its share of the $8B plastics polymer business by creating a fully integrated end-to-end solution for the entire lifecycle of a product, from reclamation to development to sale. This vertically integrated approach, achieved through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pioneer Products LLC and the recently acquired Sable Polymer Solutions, allows Ecoark to control more of the manufacturing process, enabling the Company to sell its product to big box retailers with greater profit potential.The acquisition of Sable allows Pioneer to be aggressive with costs because it controls more of the supply chain. Sable also offers a non-commoditized resin product, sourced from a natural pellet material from a manufacturer in Puerto Rico that is sterile grade, allowing the Company to expand out of retail into verticals such as the automotive and healthcare industries and generate higher revenues with a greater expansion of profit margins."What we have created is a powerful, vertically integrated solution for recycling technologies available to the market today. Our proprietary process allows us to control manufacturing and costs, which results in higher profits and revenues," said Roshan Weerasinghe, COO, Pioneer Products. "As we continue to sell our products back in to big box retailers across the country, we are also expanding our research and development in order to expand on the range of products we can produce from these reclaimed materials. Our acquisition of Sable Polymer has made it possible for us to move outside of the retail application, and to continue expanding our presence in this growing market."Each year, $11.5B worth of recyclable products are thrown into landfills, 70% of which is recoverable plastic materials that are worth more than $8B. A study from 2015 reported that 66% of consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable brands and products, creating an enormous market opportunity for companies than can provide those types of products to retailers.About Ecoark Holdings Inc.Based in Rogers AR and founded in 2011, Ecoark Holdings, Inc. is a growth-oriented company based in the retail and logistics hub of Northwest Arkansas.

"We believe this allows us to enhance our product offerings to current clients while also giving us greater access to a broad base of untapped customers, which should allow us to increase penetration within the market while driving more revenue."According to Teradata, retailers often invest up to 65% of their inventory dollars in slow moving or dying items, in SKUs that contribute just 5% to sales, resulting in increased supply chain waste and less revenue."We are excited to launch this business with an industry leader like Ecoark and to work together to ensure our customers are gaining the most revenue out of their products with minimal loss," said Andrew Coleman, Senior Vice President of Strategic Ventures, Teradata. "Their supply chain technologies, in combination with our solutions for retailers, provide a turnkey solution that both eliminates waste and builds efficient, automated processes that ensure retail success.As an authorized reseller of Teradata's solutions, Eco360 can package Teradata's solutions with its own or sell it as a standalone offering.About Ecoark Holdings Inc.Based in Rogers AR and founded in 2011, Ecoark Holdings, Inc. is a growth-oriented company based in the retail and logistics hub of Northwest Arkansas.

As highlighted in a recent feature article from Talk Business & Politics, Ecoark has continued to grow its share of the $8B plastics polymer business by creating a fully integrated end-to-end solution for the entire lifecycle of a product, from reclamation to development to sale. This vertically integrated approach, achieved through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pioneer Products LLC and the recently acquired Sable Polymer Solutions, allows Ecoark to control more of the manufacturing process, enabling the Company to sell its product to big box retailers with greater profit potential.
The acquisition of Sable allows Pioneer to be aggressive with costs because it controls more of the supply chain. Sable also offers a non-commoditized resin product, sourced from a natural pellet material from a manufacturer in Puerto Rico that is sterile grade, allowing the Company to expand out of retail into verticals such as the automotive and healthcare industries and generate higher revenues with a greater expansion of profit margins.
 "What we have created is a powerful, vertically integrated solution for recycling technologies available to the market today. Our proprietary process allows us to control manufacturing and costs, which results in higher profits and revenues," said Roshan Weerasinghe, COO, Pioneer Products. "As we continue to sell our products back in to big box retailers across the country, we are also expanding our research and development in order to expand on the range of products we can produce from these reclaimed materials. Our acquisition of Sable Polymer has made it possible for us to move outside of the retail application, and to continue expanding our presence in this growing market."
Each year, $11.5B worth of recyclable products are thrown into landfills, 70% of which is recoverable plastic materials that are worth more than $8B. A study from 2015 reported that 66% of consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable brands and products, creating an enormous market opportunity for companies than can provide those types of products to retailers.

Ecoark Holdings, Inc. Press Release:
Pioneer Products, a subsidiary of Ecoark Holdings, Inc. (“Ecoark”) (OTCQX: EARK), today announced that Weston Geigle has joined the company as its new CEO. In this role, he will focus on growing efficiencies in Pioneer’s current business, as well as developing new business opportunities through both retail product acquisitions and strategic partnerships.
Weston has an established record of leadership and success in cultivating strong customer relationships, new business development and sustainable sales growth with major national retailers including Walmart, Sam’s Club, Target, Meijer, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops, among many others. He is skilled at identifying trigger points within a business and analyzing data and trends to find business opportunities to deliver viable solutions that add value to strategic partners and retailers.
“This leadership change is another positive step for the future of Ecoark as we continue to hold our portfolio management teams accountable for delivering financial results. Weston’s experience working with a broad spectrum of brands – from private label to some of the strongest brands in their respective industries – uniquely qualifies him for the position of CEO at Pioneer Products,” said Jay Puchir, CEO of Ecoark. “He is entrepreneurial minded, customer focused, product driven and brand conscious. We are excited to have him join our team and are looking forward to him growing Pioneer’s business.”
Weston’s career has taken him around the world, giving him valuable insights into global sourcing, manufacturing, the direct import supply chain and product development. He began his career at Mahco Outdoors as an operations manager involved in the product development, sourcing and manufacturing of private label apparel and worked his way up to national account manager, where he was responsible for leading numerous national accounts, new business development and a team of sales representatives covering a broad scope of retailers. Most recently, Weston served as the national account manager for the Dallas Cowboys, where he was responsible for Walmart, Sam’s Club, Target and Meijer, among many other national retailers.
“I’m looking forward to executing on Pioneer Products’ vision of equipping and empowering entrepreneurs, companies and strategic partners to achieve their goals,” added Weston.

Measuring Produce Freshness: Part One–Ensuring Delivered Freshness  





        Bill McBeath Published on Jun 27, 2017 Freshness ‘blindness’ causes a lot of waste in produce supply chains.
