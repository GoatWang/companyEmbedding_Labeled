The exhibition organizing industry is intensely competitive. The barriers to
enter the industry is low, and an organizer lacking sufficient experience;
financing; and/ or media sources is vulnerable, since it does not have any
bargaining power with the exhibitors; exhibitors are able to extract many
favors, such as price discounts and prime corner locations. Also, in cities
where one exhibition center has total domination, the owner of the center (main
supplier) has significant bargaining power on negotiation with exhibition
organizer on leasing exhibition spaces.

The industry is currently evolving in such a way that multinational organizers
will be able to dominate this business area because their control over key
sources, such as long term cooperation with international exhibition centers and
plentiful experience, and sufficient financing. Such organizers have numerous
competitive advantages, such as the ability to acquire financing for their
organizing activities and expand its market by merger and/or acquisition of
other organizers. All of our competitors will likely be organizers of
substantially larger size and capacity, with far greater financial and personnel
resources and longer operating histories, and may be better able to acquire
properties, personnel and financing, and enter into more favorable arrangement
on exhibition organizing business.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 23, 2013 as Show King
Holdings Inc. We changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to
the State of California (the "Conversion") on June 26, 2015. On December 21, 
2014, we acquire the sole ownership of GUI Corp., incorporated in


 the State of 
California on August 9, 2000, and GUI Corp. becomes our wholly owned subsidiary
accordingly. On December 31, 2014, we set up Mega Show Corp. in the State of 
Nevada. As an organizer, GUI Corp. has operated its business to organize 
consumer exhibition events since 2000.
 
Generally, a consumer exhibition event entails communicating between the
providers of consumer products or services and consumers the information on
specific consumer products or services exhibited. In other words, the main
purpose of such communication is to facilitate and strengthen the consumer's
awareness and attention of the specific consumer products or services exhibited.
Accordingly, a successful consumer exhibition event may excite the consumption
demands for the specific consumer products or services exhibited. Through GUI
Corp. and Mega Show Corp., we operate the business, as an organizer, to organize
consumer exhibition events. The process we organize an exhibition consists of
followings:

(1) Exhibition Planning: We determine the exhibition theme and how to perform 
    the exhibition based on the exhibitors' different topics, products, 
    services, or the mediums to be featured. Specifically, in terms of such 
    planning, we need to set objectives; timescales; space requirements; key 
    message(s) to be communicated; the types and extents that products and/or 
    services will be exhibited; stand staff selection and training, and 
    pre-show, at-show and post-show promotional activity. Additionally, we need
    to decide the suitable exhibition locations and manage exhibition budget
    through a considerate process.

(2) Obtaining Suitable Exhibition Spaces, then subletting them to exhibitors:
    When the exhibition planning is determined, we will seek to lease the spaces
    suitable for conducting the exhibition and divided such spaces into 
    different booths. After then, we will seek to sublet these booths to the 
    exhibitors that intend to join the exhibition. Such spaces must meet the 
    specific requirements necessary for conducting exhibitions. These specific
    requirements include, but are not limited to, lighting; storage; 
    demonstrations; sound; music; booth dispensing; and/or booth design. In 
    obtaining such exhibition spaces, we are required to comply with the 
    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and are encouraged to be sensitive, 
    and as reasonably accommodating as possible, to visitors with disabilities. 
    Additionally, we are required to comply with different subletting laws or 
    regulations in the particular jurisdiction where we organize the exhibition.

(3) Marketing Exhibitions: We promote our exhibitions by soliciting and 
    coordinating exhibitors; co-organizers; sponsors; and/or visitors. 
    Furthermore, we promote exhibitions by radios; newspapers; bulletins; 
    and/or other methods, including social websites, etc.

Currently, the types of consumer exhibition events we have organized
continuously are various tattoo shows. The geographic regions we organized such
consumer exhibition events are California; Illinois; and Nevada. Our business
strategy is to generate revenue only through (1) the aggregate ticket sales from
the exhibitions, and (2) the aggregate rental made by subletting booths to vast
exhibitors.

Because the Company sells tickets to visitors and sublets booths to exhibitors,
its revenue is contingent upon the success of such exhibitions. The Company does
not provide any refunds payable on any tickets sold. The basis for recognizing
its revenue is (1) the amount of tickets sold and (2) the amount of subletting
rental paid to us. According to the guidance under ASC 605- 45-45,the Company
recognizes its revenue based on gross amount because it has earned all revenue
from the sale of tickets in the exhibitions it organizes and the subletting
rental paid by exhibitors.

The Company is in substance acting as the principal that holds substantially all
of the risks and benefits related to organizing consumer exhibition events.

MIAMI and LONDON, April 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Burger King Worldwide Holdings, Inc. ("Burger King Worldwide"), the world's second largest fast food hamburger restaurant chain, and Justice Holdings Limited ("Justice") (LSE: JUSH), a publicly listed UK investment vehicle, today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement.  
Under the terms of the agreement 3G Capital, a global investment firm and Burger King Worldwide's principal stockholder, will receive approximately $1.4 billion in cash and continue as the majority shareholder. The Justice shareholders and its founders will own approximately 29% of the combined company. Upon closing, the combined company will be incorporated in Delaware and will be renamed Burger King Worldwide, Inc. Justice's shares will be immediately suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange and, upon closing, it is expected that the newly formed combined company will list and commence trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
On Wednesday, April 4, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, Justice will host a teleconference, web presentation and question and answer session to provide details on the transaction.  The webcast can be accessed by dialing 1-888-874-9470 (toll-free) or 1-973-935-8772 (international) using Conference ID: 69148426, by visiting www.justiceholdingsltd.com.  
"2011 was a pivotal year for the BURGER KING® brand," said Bernardo Hees, chief executive officer, Burger King Worldwide. "Since 3G Capital's acquisition of the company, along with our Franchisees, we have rolled out our four-pillar strategy in North America and expanded our international footprint in key growth markets.  Burger King Worldwide's long-term strategy and its entire senior management team will remain unchanged.  In partnership with our new public shareholders, we will continue to focus on creating profitable growth for our franchise system, while delivering best-in-class food and service for our guests."  
"We believe it is the right time for Burger King to be publicly traded in the U.S. again," said Daniel Schwartz, chief financial officer Burger King Worldwide  "With this transaction, we are positioning the BURGER KING® brand for long-term growth both domestically and internationally and are excited to take this next step in delivering on our strategic objectives."
"Justice has been extremely disciplined in considering potential operating businesses since its formation in February 2011," commented Lord Myners, the independent Chairman of Justice's Board of Directors adding that:  "The Burger King transaction offers a number of the key features the Board was looking for in a combination:  strong cash flows, an experienced and successful management team, significant strategic growth opportunities and a company that would benefit from Justice's public ownership.  The Board voted unanimously in favor of entering into the combination agreement with Burger King Worldwide.  We look forward to closing the transaction later this year, once the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and The New York Stock Exchange are satisfied."
Justice co-founder Nicolas Berggruen added:  "The transaction with Burger King exemplifies our ability to bring Justice shareholders access to investments that would not otherwise be available to them.  We believe that Burger King's aggressive plans for international growth will benefit from its visibility as a NYSE-listed public company.  We looked at many different opportunities over the last 14 months, but Burger King stood out as a unique global player in the expanding international quick service restaurant industry with a strong heritage and an aggressive transformation underway in its North America business unit."
Justice co-founder Martin E. Franklin commented that:  "The management team that 3G Capital has assembled to operate Burger King is extremely impressive and their progress in implementing cost control, and developing an international growth strategy in a relatively short period of time has been outstanding.  We agree with management that the BURGER KING® brand is still at an early stage of its true potential, and believe that over the next three to five years the U.S. turnaround and international growth franchise model can lead to significant margin expansion and free cash flow growth.  I look forward to serving on the Board with Alan Parker and supporting this global franchise."  
William A. Ackman, a co-founder of Justice, commented, "I have long admired 3G's track record as best-in-class operators in the beverage (Anheuser Busch), retail (Lojas Americanas), logistics, and rail road industries, and I have personally invested in 3G Capital's private equity funds.  When I learned that Burger King was interested in a possible transaction with Justice, I brought the opportunity to my Justice founding partners to consider.  They liked what I saw, a 58-year-old global brand, and a simple, predictable, free cash flow growth franchise in the process of transformation into a pure brand royalty business.  The results to date have been remarkable."  
Mr. Ackman continued:  "Since 3G's acquisition of Burger King in October 2010, EBITDA minus CapEx has increased from $320 million in 2010, to $503 million in 2011, with 2012 EBITDA minus CapEx expected to be nearly double that of 2010's results.  As importantly, Burger King's management has made substantial progress in accelerating international growth through the formation of joint ventures with third-party capital sources and local operators.  As a result of management's initiatives and the power of this global brand, I am confident this will be an excellent investment for Justice shareholders.  In order to avoid the potential for any actual or perceived conflict of interest, 3G will make an in-kind distribution to me of shares in Burger King reflecting my proportionate interest in the 3G private equity fund.  As a result, I will receive stock and no cash from this transaction.  At the closing of the deal, through the additional indirect economic interests I will own through the Pershing Square funds, I will be substantially increasing my personal stake in the company.   I have committed to retain my personal stake until after Pershing Square is no longer a shareholder." 
As part of the agreement, Martin Franklin and Alan Parker, one of Justice's independent directors, will join the Board of Directors at closing, along with all of the existing Burger King Worldwide board members.  Martin E. Franklin is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Jarden, a NYSE-listed, diversified consumer products company with revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, for which he previously served as its Chief Executive Officer.  Alan Parker was previously the Chief Executive of Whitbread PLC, the UK's largest hotel and restaurant company.  
In the transaction, Justice's co-founders have agreed to reduce their founders interests to 3% of the combined company's outstanding shares and have waived the right to receive any other additional equity interests originally contemplated by the Justice structure. 
Investment funds managed by Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. will own approximately 10% of the combined company's outstanding shares which it will receive as a result of its interests in Justice.
The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, and requires no further shareholder approvals.  The transaction is subject to other customary approvals, including antitrust approval, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed shortly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The transaction closing and listing is expected to occur in approximately 60 – 90 days.
In preparation for the closing of the transaction Justice has converted its liquid assets from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars. 
Tegris Advisors acted as lead mergers and acquisitions financial advisors to Justice on the transaction. Barclays Capital Inc. rendered a fairness opinion to Justice's Board of Directors.  Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal counsel to Burger King Worldwide and 3G Capital.  Greenberg Traurig, P.A. and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal counsel to Justice on the transaction.
