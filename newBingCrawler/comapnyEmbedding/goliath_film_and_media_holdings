	Background.





	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name “China Advanced Technology” as the successor
	by merger to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. (“Vitalcare”). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent
	a holding company reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding
	Corporation, and Vitalcare, together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding
	Corporation subsequently reincorporated in Nevada by merger into China Advanced.




	 




	Vitalcare
	was in the business of administering medical clinics specializing in diabetes treatment. It was the successor to Network Financial
	Services, Inc. (“Network”), which went public in an underwritten offering in 1987. Network was engaged in mortgage
	origination, and changed its name to Westmark Group Holdings (“Westmark”) in 1993 in connection with the acquisition
	of Westmark Mortgage from Primark Corporation. Westmark ceased operations at some time in 2006, and in 2006 ceased filing reports
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The corporate entity was thereafter known as Viking Consolidated, Inc. (2006), Tailor
	Aquaponics World Wide, Inc. (2007) and Diversified Acquisitions (2007) until it entered the medical clinic business in early 2008.
	The Company has no information regarding any business activities from 2006 after the mortgage origination business closed, to
	early 2008.




	 




	On
	October 25, 2011, Goliath Film and Media International, a California corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
	(the “Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which Goliath Film and Media International was acquired by China Advanced
	Technology. Prior to the acquisition, our principal operations consisted of internet marketing, and were conducted through a wholly
	owned subsidiary, Live Wise, Inc. Live Wise was disposed of on October 31, 2011 for cancellation of debt and shares described
	below. At the Closing Date, there were no assets or liabilities on China Advanced Technology’s balance sheets.




	 




	The
	transaction closed on October 31, 2011 (the “Closing Date”). On the Closing Date China Advanced Technology acquired
	Goliath Film and Media International by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares
	after giving effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology’s prior
	control person. Immediately following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name
	of China Advanced Technology was changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings. All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an
	eight-for-1 forward stock split affected as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on
	February 13, 2012.




	 





	Overview.





	 




	Goliath
	Film and Media Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Goliath Film and Media International and Goliath Movie Partners
	1, LLC (collectively, “Goliath” or the “Company”), develops, produces and licenses for distribution, domestically
	and internationally, quality digital content with an emphasis on “niche” markets of the feature motion picture and
	television content segments of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, faith-based, horror and socially
	responsible minority content. Goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any
	significant extent.




	 




	In
	qualified cases, Goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production, but will be
	licensed for distribution through the Company. Also, in certain cases Goliath will produce content that is tied to working with
	an established distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed
	by the participating distributor. Goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally, through
	a wide distribution network which includes major international theatrical exhibitors, and other distributors and television networks.
	We plan to utilize corporate sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution. Further,
	we may augment our marketing efforts with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional “print”
	media with press releases targeted specifically toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an “as
	needed” basis as well as the inclusion of targeted “social media” campaigns.




	 




	Goliath’s
	revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees. A limited number of its content properties include projects developed
	and produced by Goliath and those produced by an independent third party production entity.

	What
	is your business?





	 




	We
	develop, produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content. At this time we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases
	of motion pictures, due to the high up- front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically. However, in some specific cases
	the company will consider theatrical releases based upon a “four wall, “ limited release delivery that will be focused
	on targeted niche audiences.

	Birds” a science fiction movie produced by Goliath to Mar Vista Entertainment LLC. Additionally, Mar Vista Entertainment,
	LLC will receive 30% of the gross proceeds for a period of 25 years on the film. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has received
	$175,000 of the advance payments. Terror Birds was completed December 14, 2015 and Mar Vista is looking to distribute this film.




	 




	On
	April 15, 2015 Goliath signed an agreement whereby the Company agreed to invest $15,000 to KKO Productions to produce a feature
	length motion picture known as “Forgiven”. Per the agreement Goliath will receive 15% of adjusted gross proceeds after
	its initial investment has been entirely recouped through adjusted gross proceed. Additionally, the Company will receive two on
	screen credits as Executive Producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising, publicity and packaging of the motion picture.
	The investment of $15,000 presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid, due to the fact that no revenues
	will be generated until this motion picture’s released.




	 





	What
	is the timeline for your activities during the next 12 months?





	 




	Over
	the next 90 days to one year, our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing
	by them of at least three projects.




	 





	What
	is this going to cost you?





	 




	We
	expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately $150,000 per project, however licensing and distribution
	will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from 30 – 35% and the costs of advertising and marketing
	will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds.





	 






	Why
	are these motion pictures not being distributed already?






	 





	The
	motion pictures that are being produced by the Company and distributed by Mar Vista Entertainment, LLC take anywhere from six
	to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements.




	 




	Generically,
	the main reason why good, quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money
	and creativity, and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills. Many people dream of making a movie;
	few aspire to distribute them. We estimate that there are in excess of 10,000 such motion pictures “gathering dust.”
	There also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many States and international
	Territories, so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects.
	A secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor. We think that our management has an excellent reputation
	in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content. Finally, many distributors as well as buyers do
	not have an interest in niche market films, because they see the market as limited. Goliath sees the problem to be, rather, there
	is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches. Most participants in the motion picture
	industry are based in “Hollywood” and the major coastal metropolitan areas. Our “faith-based” films especially
	are targeted toward the “Bible Belt” and the “Flyover Country”: places that the industry has consistently
	overlooked.

	Why
	are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos?






	 





	After
	attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years, our Staff has developed relationships
	with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath has also developed vital
	relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks. Many of the filmmakers have requested the Company’s
	assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product
	that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators, distributors, networks and studios.




	 





	So
	how are you different than Amazon, Netflix, Blockbuster and Hulu, to name a few? How can you compete with them? They have a lot
	of money and name recognition. Why wouldn’t they jump into your niches?





	 




	As
	a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content. As
	an example, NETFLIX has such a high demand for programming content, they are spending $5 billion this year for the acquisition
	of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them. Therefore, as is mentioned, part of their
	resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting in-house” and joint venture production of quality
	content. This content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level.




	 




	There
	are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors, Goliath is moving toward
	becoming one of these content providers. We believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand
	for programming is increasing almost exponentially. Irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumer/subscriber, the demand
	for quality content is continuing to expand. As an example there are currently, approximately 416 original scripted programs being
	aired in the entire television universe – a cancellation rate of 10% reflects a number that represents the entire programming
	universe in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s.. The upward trend is ongoing, which is where we see an opportunity for
	Goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market.




	 





	Don’t
	cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like TBN (for faith based) and BET (Black Entertainment Television
	(for the African-American Community)?





	 




	As
	mentioned above about NETFLIX, even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type, genre and format of
	the content that they are showing in order to remain viable, therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming
	is ongoing and expanding..




	 





	What
	other niches are you looking at entering?





	 




	We
	believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches. Many viewers have cable or satellite
	service with hundreds of channels, but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests. One significant type
	of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the United States. Other than Spanish speaking immigrants, coverage
	is scarce. The last official data (2004) from the US Census Bureau is that 34.2 million persons in the US are foreign born, with
	54% from Latin America, 25% from Asia and 14% from Europe. Foreign-born immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries.




	 




	There
	are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming. As an example in Hawaii and Southern California,
	for instance, Surfing is quite popular, and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest.




	 





	What
	about ancillary markets?





	 




	We
	plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible.




	 





	What
	films do you have now in inventory?





	 




	We
	presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures:

	, Seducing Spirits, The Perfect Argument,
	Marina Murders, Film Struggle, Divorce in America, A Wonderful Summer, The Truth About Layla, Living with Cancer, The Biggest
	Fan, Days of Redemption, On Borrowed Time, Tumbleweed, Virus X, Farewell, Buddies, and The Pit

	. Under the distribution agreements
	Goliath will receive 30% of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute. In general, our distribution contracts
	cover both domestic and international licensing agreements; however, for the picture

	The Biggest Fan

	we obtained limited
	distribution rights.

	We
	enter into a Distribution Agreement for each motion picture. Terms may be perpetual or limited by years. The motion pictures that
	we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years. We will generally obtain a fee of 20% to 30%
	of gross revenues. Licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multi-year basis. Most markets, especially
	foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing.




	 





	How

	Item
	1A. RISK FACTORS.





	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Business





	 






	Our
	limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and to make decisions based on of our historical
	performance.






	 




	We
	have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business on the basis of historical operations. As
	a consequence, it is difficult to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results
	may not be representative of the results we will achieve. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations,
	we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses.
	If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which
	may result in a decline in our stock price.






	 








	Economic
	conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition






	 




	The
	global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility. We cannot predict when economic conditions will improve
	or stabilize. A prolonged period of economic volatility or decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
	and financial condition and/or exacerbate the other risks related to its business.




	 






	Our
	results of operations depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that
	we distribute, and underperformance at the box office or in television licensing of one or more motion pictures in any period
	can cause our results to be less than anticipated






	 




	Our
	results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming
	that we distribute, which cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, the underperformance at the box office of one or
	more motion pictures in any period may cause our revenue and earnings results for that period (and potentially, subsequent periods)
	to be less than anticipated, in some instances to a significant extent. Due to the difficulty of predicting our results of operations
	and the other factors, it is difficult for industry or financial analysts to accurately forecast our results. The trading market
	for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that such industry or financial analysts publish about us or our
	business. If an analyst who covers us changes his or her financial estimates or investment recommendation, or if our results of
	operations fall short of their estimates, the price of our common shares could decline.




	 






	Our
	results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors






	 




	Our
	results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures or television content that
	we distribute, which cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from
	period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods. Our results of
	operations also may fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our theatrical motion picture and home entertainment
	releases, as well as license periods for our content. Our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period
	or fiscal year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released compared to the corresponding period in the prior
	year or prior fiscal year. Our operating results also fluctuate due to our accounting practices (which are standard for the industry)
	which may cause us to recognize the production and marketing expenses in different periods than the recognition of related revenues,
	which may occur in later periods. For example, in accordance with GAAP and industry practice, we are required to expense film
	advertising costs as incurred, but are also required to recognize the revenue from any motion picture or television program over
	the entire revenue stream expected to be generated by the individual picture or television program.




	 







	 



	6



	 












	 




	The
	comparability of our results may be affected by changes in accounting guidance or changes in our ownership of certain assets and
	businesses. Accordingly, our results of operations from year to year may not be directly comparable to prior reporting periods.




	 




	As
	a result of the foregoing and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and
	the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.






	 








	Our
	success depends on the ability of our senior management team, as well as our ability to attract and retain key personnel.






	 




	Our
	success is highly dependent on the abilities of its management team. The management team must be able to effectively work together
	to successfully conduct our current operations, as well as implement our strategy, which includes significant domestic expansion.
	If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. In addition, as part of our strategy
	of international expansion, there is intense competition for the services of qualified personnel. The failure to retain current
	key managers or key members of the development, production, or marketing staff, or to hire additional qualified personnel for
	new operations could be detrimental to our business.




	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Securities





	 






	We
	may raise capital in future offerings



	.





	 




	An
	offering might require the participation of institutional investors, which are more likely to demand more stringent terms for
	any placement. We have not determined the terms for any offering. Any future offering may be for common stock, or may be for a
	security with rights superior to that of the common stock. In connection with any offering, we may be required to add investor’s
	representatives to the Board of Directors, or may be required to commit to other conditions. If other conditions are not met,
	existing investors could have their rights or equity ownership substantially diluted. We cannot at this time determine the terms
	of any follow-on offering or whether it will ever occur.





	 







	We
	do not expect to pay dividends on our outstanding shares in the foreseeable future.






	 




	We
	have not paid dividends in the past and do not have, or anticipate having, any funds for such purpose in the foreseeable future.
	Even if such funds become available, we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future but, instead, will use all funds
	from operations for the continued development of the business.




	 






	Our
	common stock is quoted only on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.






	 




	Our
	common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York
	Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available
	for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock,
	and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.




	 






	Because
	we became public by means of a “reverse merger,” we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.






	 




	Additional
	risks may exist since we became public through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may
	not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We
	cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of us in the future.




	 






	We

	would like to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market as soon as practicable. However, we cannot assure you that we
	will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or of any other stock exchange, or that we will be able
	to maintain any such listing. We are presently on the OTC Bulletin Board thus, investor liquidity may be limited.

	In
	the event we seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we may be unable
	to find additional capital on terms favorable to us and our stockholders.






	 




	In
	the event that we need additional working capital for our projected operations, we may seek capital through debt or equity offerings
	which could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our
	capital stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock would result in a reduction of the percentage of ownership interest
	held by our existing stockholders. Also, the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or
	the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.
	Finally, we may not be able to find additional capital on terms favorable to us through existing markets or investors due to market
	conditions, our historical performance, or our stock price.




	 






	There
	may be issuances of shares of preferred stock in the future.






	 




	Although
	we currently do not have preferred shares outstanding, we could at some time in the future authorize preferred shares and the
	board of directors could complete the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our
	assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders, and the right
	to the redemption of such shares, possibly together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent
	that we do issue preferred stock, the rights of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including without limitation,
	with respect to liquidation.




	 






	Compliance
	with corporate governance and disclosure standards is costly.






	 




	We
	have spent and continue to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards
	relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. Because we qualify as a smaller reporting company, our independent registered
	public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report. However, there is no guarantee that we will receive management
	assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting
	is effective in future periods. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered
	public accounting firm determines that our internal controls over financial reporting is not effective as required by Section
	404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected. In addition, overhead may increase as a result of
	the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal requirements associated with being a public reporting company.




	 






	Our
	compliance with SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly.






	 




	It
	may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required
	by SEC rules including Sarbanes-Oxley. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance
	staff in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with
	Sarbanes-Oxley’s internal controls requirements, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications
	that Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires publicly-traded companies to obtain.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 





	The
	SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
	financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments,
	often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified
	the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant
	to understanding our results. For additional information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.




	 




	The
	following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the Company.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation







	 






	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances
	and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing
	and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
	accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions
	are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present
	fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates







	 






	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. The more significant estimates and assumptions
	by management include among others: Estimated revenue of films. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty
	inherent in these estimates and assumptions.




	 







	 



	10



	 












	 




	Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
	are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	We
	will recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 926-605, “Entertainment Films, Revenue Recognition”.




	 




	Under
	ASC 926-605, five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered, (iii) the license period has begun, (vi) the price is fixed or determinable,
	and (v) collection is reasonably assured. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience
	considering economic and industry trends. The Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with
	all technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s
	rights system.




	 





	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable, if any are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will
	be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables.
	If there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience,
	our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carrying
	accounts receivable.




	 





	Intangible
	Assets





	 




	The
	Company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property, principally motion pictures. The Company periodically reviews
	its long lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value. There was no amortization expense
	or impairment for the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	We
	account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC
	740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
	the enactment date.




	 





	Stock
	Compensation





	 




	In
	accordance with ASC No. 718,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	(“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation
	costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements
	over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
	restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation
	cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective
	vesting periods of the option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued
	to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505,

	Equity
	Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.
	In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the
	non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized
	over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.

	Accounting
	for Derivative Financial Instruments





	 




	We
	evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by ASC 815 and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items
	identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	We
	follow the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about
	fair value measurements.




	 




	We
	use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common
	stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value.
	These require management’s judgment.




	 





	Fair
	Value Measurements






	 





	Effective
	beginning second quarter 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,

	Financial Instruments

	, requires disclosures about fair value of
	financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments
	and long-term debt. Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, clarifies the definition of
	fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
	the use of fair value measurements.




	 




	Various
	inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies
	used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These
	inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.




	 






	●




	Level
	1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,
	etc.).






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
	investments).






	 




	The
	carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
	assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.
	The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
	statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at April
	30, 2016, assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature.




	 




	The
	availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including
	the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For
	many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted
	by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of April 30, 2016, the Company had no
	assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs.




	 





	Basic
	and diluted earnings per share





	 




	Basic
	earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted Earnings per share
	is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may
	be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:

	The
	FASB ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings Per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings
	per share, assuming dilution.




	 




	Diluted
	earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
	the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained
	thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.




	 




	Basic
	and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the years ended April 30, 2016
	and 2015.




	 





	Concentrations,
	Risks, and Uncertainties





	 




	The
	Company did not have a concentration of business with suppliers or customers constituting greater than 10% of the Company’s
	gross sales during 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	 





	We

	are no such pronouncements expected to have an impact on our future financial statements.

	Although
	the Company had net income of $34,460 for the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $278,815 for the year ended
	April 30, 2015. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	management plan to continue as a going concern revolves around its ability to execute its business strategy of distributing digital
	content, as well as raising the necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company.




	 




	In

	$150,000 for the costs related to being public, and miscellaneous office expenses. We sold 30,852,250 shares for net proceeds
	of $328,855 in offerings conducted in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. As we move forward with our business plan we will need to raise

	To
	the Board of Directors




	Goliath
	Film & Media Holdings




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Goliath Film & Media Holdings (the Company) as of April 30, 2016
	and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each
	of the years in the two year period ended April 30, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
	statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
	its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
	as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
	opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Goliath
	Film & Media Holdings as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the years
	in the two year period ended April 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does
	it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs as of April 30, 2016 which raises substantial
	doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these matters are also described in
	Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	On
	October 31, 2011 (the “Closing Date”), China Advanced Technology (an entity formed on February 16, 2010 in the State
	of Nevada) acquired Goliath Film and Media International, a California corporation, by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common
	Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares after giving effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares
	held by China Advanced Technology’s prior control person. Immediately following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued
	and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name of China Advanced Technology was changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings (“Goliath”
	or “the Company”). All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an eight-for-1 forward stock split affected as
	of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on February 13, 2012. The transaction was accounted
	for as a reverse acquisition in which Goliath Film and Media International is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the prior
	operations of Goliath (formerly China Advanced Technology) are consolidated for accounting purposes. Since Goliath had no operations,
	assets, or liabilities as of the Closing, no audit of that entity was required under the materiality thresholds of Regulation
	S-X Rule 8-04.




	 





	Organization,
	Nature of Business and Trade Name





	 




	The
	Company is engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures and television content. The Company has begun to realize
	revenues from its planned principal business purpose.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts
	and transactions have been eliminated.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing
	and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
	accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions
	are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present
	fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred.




	 




	Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
	are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
	three months or less to be cash equivalents.

	NOTES

	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2016 AND 2015




	 




	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable, if any are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will
	be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables.
	If there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience,
	our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carrying
	accounts receivable.




	 





	Intangible
	Assets





	 




	The
	Company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property, principally motion pictures. The Company periodically reviews
	its long lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value. There was no amortization expense
	or impairment for the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Films
	and Televisions Costs





	 




	The
	Company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20, “Entertainment-Films - Other Assets
	- Film Costs”. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as
	a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates
	its capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future
	sales.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	We
	will recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 926-605, “Entertainment Films, Revenue Recognition”.




	 




	Under
	ASC 926-605, five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered, (iii) the license period has begun, (iv) the price is fixed or determinable,
	and (v) collection is reasonably assured. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience
	considering economic and industry trends. The Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with
	all technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s
	rights system.




	 





	Advertising





	 




	Advertising
	expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Advertising expense was $0 and $1,404, for
	the years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	We
	account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC
	740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
	the enactment date.

	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company follows the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures
	about fair value measurements.




	 




	The
	Company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its
	common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine
	fair value. These require management’s judgment.





	 






	Fair
	Value Measurements






	 





	Effective
	beginning second quarter 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,

	Financial Instruments

	, requires disclosures about fair value of
	financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments
	and long-term debt. Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, clarifies the definition of
	fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
	the use of fair value measurements.




	 




	Various
	inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies
	used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These
	inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.




	 




	●	Level
	1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.




	 




	●	Level
	2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).




	 




	●	Level
	3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).




	 




	The
	Company’s adoption of FASB ASC Topic 825 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	 




	The
	carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
	assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.
	The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
	statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at April
	30, 2016, assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature.




	 




	The
	availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including
	the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For
	many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted
	by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of April 30, 2016, the Company had no
	assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs.

	Earnings Per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings
	per share, assuming dilution.




	 




	Diluted
	earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
	the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained
	thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.

	In
	accordance with ASC No. 718,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	(“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation
	costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements
	over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
	restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation
	cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective
	vesting periods of the option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued
	to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505,

	Equity
	Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.
	In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the
	non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized
	over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.

	During

	we issued 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144, in exchange for $60,000. The issuance

	NOTE
	3 - GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
	of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source
	of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Under
	the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
	the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
	in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	During
	the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
	business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
	may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.




	 




	Historically,
	the Company has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and
	growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through
	loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s
	failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon its and its shareholders.




	 




	In
	the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming
	year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances, focus on a possible joint
	venture or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated
	above.

	between 2018 and 2035. Realization of this potential future tax benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior
	to expiration of the loss carryforward. The deferred tax asset related to this (and other) potential future tax benefits has been
	offset by a valuation allowance in the same amount. The amount of the deferred tax asset ultimately realizable could be increased
	in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforwards period are revised.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 





	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures

	. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed,
	summarized, and reported accurately, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and within the required
	time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
	and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the end of the period
	covered by this report (April 30, 2016), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
	of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
	Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to accurately record, process, summarize
	and report certain information required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings within the required time periods,
	and to accumulate and communicate to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
	timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 





	Internal
	Control Over Financial Reporting.

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
	over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
	and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our internal
	control over financial reporting was not effective as of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.




	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
	to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	This
	annual report on internal control over financial reporting does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered
	public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide
	only management’s report in this Annual Report.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Controls





	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 that have materially
	affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.

	Personal and Business Management Corporation with Wilt Chamberlain, representing and managing a client base comprising actors,

	Mike
	Criscione, 63, has been on the Board since May 1, 2014 has been a highly successful business man and real estate developer. He
	brought this extensive experience to the film business in 1991, producing “LA Goddess”. From 2008 to the present Mr.
	Criscione has directed, financed and produced numerous commercials, music videos, several motion pictures, and documentaries.
	He is a graduate of Vision Bible College in Whittier, California where he earned his Bachelor degree.




	 






	Director
	Independence






	 




	Currently,
	the Company does not have any independent directors. Since the Company’s Common Stock is not currently listed on a national
	securities exchange, we have used the definition of “independence” of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination.




	 




	Under
	NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2), an “independent director” is a “person other than an officer or employee of
	the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would
	interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.”




	 




	We
	do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. However, we do intend to comply with
	the independent director and committee composition requirements in the future.




	 





	Limitation
	of Liability and Indemnification






	 





	Goliath’s
	Articles of Incorporation provisions may be interpreted to provide for the indemnification of officers and directors for certain
	civil liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. In the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
	such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.




	 





	Code
	of Ethics





	 




	Goliath
	Film and Media Holdings has not adopted a code of ethics which applies to the chief executive officer, chief operating officer
	and chief financial officer, because of our level of operations of the public entity in 2016.




	 




	Audit
	Committee Financial Expert




	 




	Goliath
	Film and Media Holdings does not have either an Audit Committee or a financial expert on the Board of Directors. The Board of
	Directors believes that obtaining the services of an audit committee financial expert is not economically rational at this time
	in light of the costs associated with identifying and retaining an individual who would qualify as an audit committee financial
	expert, the limited scope of our operations and the relative simplicity of our financial statements and accounting procedures.




	 




	Section
	16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance




	 




	Section
	16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Goliath Film and Media Holdings officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent
	of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors
	and ten percent stockholders are required by regulation to furnish Goliath Film and Media Holdings with copies of all Section
	16(a) forms they file. The Company’s common stock did not become registered under the Exchange Act until after the year
	ended April 30, 2012, so Section 16(a) is not applicable to the Company.

	The
	following table sets forth information relating to the beneficial ownership of Company common stock as of July 1, 2012 by (i)
	each person known by Goliath Film and Media Holdings to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common
	stock (ii) each of Goliath Film and Media Holdings directors and executive officers, and (iii) the Percentage After Offering assumes
	the sale of all shares offered. Unless otherwise noted below, Goliath Film and Media Holdings believes that all persons named
	in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. For
	purposes hereof, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired by such person within 60 days
	from the date hereof upon the exercise of warrants or options or the conversion of convertible securities. Each beneficial owner’s
	percentage ownership is determined by assuming that any warrants, options or convertible securities that are held by such person
	(but not those held by any other person) and which are exercisable within 60 days from the date hereof, have been exercised.





	 





	Beneficial
	ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to the shares.

	During
	the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company sold 13,249,000 restricted common shares to an affiliate shareholder pursuant to a
	private placement memorandum in exchange for $132,490.

	The
	Chief Financial Officer received a total of 5,000,000 shares with a consulting contract expiring May 1, 2014. In addition, the

	Independence






	 




	Currently,
	the Company does not have any independent directors. Since the Company’s Common Stock is not currently listed on a national
	securities exchange, we have used the definition of “independence” of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination.




	 




	Under
	NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2), an “independent director” is a “person other than an officer or employee of
	the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would
	interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.”




	 




	We
	do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. However, we do intend to comply with
	the independent director and committee composition requirements in the future.

	light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;


	 


	3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements,

	4. I am responsible for establishing and maintaining
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
	reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:


	 


	a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,
	or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating

	b) Designed such internal control over financial

 Goliath Film and Media Holdings announces streaming site to be launched

 Goliath Film and Media Holdings (OTC Bulletin Board:    GFMH) announces that it plans to go online with its streaming site in . The Company's recently acquired 1500 educational videos will then be available to school districts, private schools and international licensees.  Yesterday, the Company announced that NBA legend AC Green has been appointed as director of the Company's Educational Division.  Having the educational videos online will facilitate immediate sales and revenues for the Company. 
In addition, the Company's existing feature motion picture film library, as well as other properties being acquired, will also be available online commencing in May. Goliath is formulating at this time the parameters of its subscription program. Its competitor Netflix offers a $7.99 per month plan; Amazon Prime (with about 5,000 films) costs $79 per year, or about $6.58 a month.  Goliath plans to fill the niche markets of faith based, education, responsible minority content, and budget horror, and plans in the next few months to add hundreds of feature motion pictures, and thousands in the next 12 to 18 months.  Goliath intends to offer an introductory subscription price much lower than its competitors in order to attract subscribers. 
About Goliath Film and Media
Goliath Film and Media Holdings ("Goliath"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goliath Film and Media International, intends to develop and distribute film content with an emphasis on "niche" markets of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, horror, faith-based, and socially responsible minority content.  Goliath will specialize in licensing quality films. Goliath also intends to develop screenplays with the intent of outsourcing the production, and locking in the distribution rights to the films produced through the Company's development efforts. Goliath plans to license films domestically and internationally, through a wide distribution network that includes major exhibitors, distributors and television networks.

	On
	October 31, 2011 (the “Closing Date”), China Advanced Technology acquired Goliath Film and Media International, a
	California corporation, by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares after giving
	effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology’s prior control person.
	Immediately following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name of China Advanced
	Technology was changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings (“Goliath”, “GFMH”, or “the Company”).
	All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an eight-for-1 forward stock split affected as of the Closing Date. The forward
	stock split was reflected in the trading market on February 13, 2012. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition
	in which Goliath Film and Media International is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the prior operations of Goliath (formerly
	China Advanced Technology) are consolidated for accounting purposes. Since Goliath and Goliath Movie Partners LLC formed July
	1, 2015, had no operations, assets, or liabilities as of the Closing, no audit of that entity was required under the materiality
	thresholds of Regulation S-X Rule 8-04.




	 




	The
	Company is engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures and digital content.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts
	and transactions have been eliminated.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing
	and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
	accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions
	are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present
	fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred.

	Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
	are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 





	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable, if any are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will
	be based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables.
	If there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience,
	our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carrying
	accounts receivable.




	 





	Intangible
	Assets





	 




	The
	Company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property, principally costs to produce films. The Company periodically
	reviews its long-lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value. There was no amortization
	expense or impairment for the quarter ended January 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 





	Films
	and Televisions Costs





	 




	The
	Company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20, “Entertainment-Films - Other Assets
	- Film Costs”. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as
	a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates
	its capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future
	sales.




	 




	Film
	production costs include the unamortized costs of films in progress which are being produced by the Company.




	 




	For
	films produced by the Company, capitalized costs include all direct production costs, and production overhead.




	 




	Costs
	of producing films are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized and participations
	and residuals costs are accrued in the proportion that current year’s revenue bears to management’s estimate of ultimate
	revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of the films.
	Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion
	picture.




	 




	Film
	production costs are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The valuation of film production costs are
	reviewed on a title-by-title basis, when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a film is less than
	its unamortized cost. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded no impairment charges.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	We
	recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 926-605, “Entertainment Films, Revenue Recognition”.




	 




	Under
	ASC 926-605, five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered, (iii) the license period has begun, (iv) the price is fixed or determinable,
	and (v) collection is reasonably assured. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience
	considering economic and industry trends. The Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with
	all technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s
	rights system.

	We
	account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC
	740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
	the enactment date.





	 






	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company follows the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures
	about fair value measurements.




	 




	The
	Company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its
	common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine
	fair value. These require management’s judgment.




	 





	Fair
	Value Measurements






	 





	Effective
	beginning second quarter 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,

	Financial Instruments

	, requires disclosures about fair value of
	financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments
	and long-term debt. Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, clarifies the definition of
	fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
	the use of fair value measurements.




	 




	Various
	inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies
	used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These
	inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.




	 






	●




	Level
	1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,
	etc.).






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
	investments).

	The
	carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
	assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.
	The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
	statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at January
	31, 2017, assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature.




	 




	The
	availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including
	the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For
	many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted
	by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of January 31, 2017, the Company had
	no assets other than prepaid expenses, film production costs, deposits, and cash.




	 





	Basic
	and diluted earnings per share





	 




	Basic
	earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted Earnings per share
	is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may
	be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:

	The

	Earnings Per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings
	per share, assuming dilution.




	 




	Diluted
	earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
	the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained
	thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.




	 




	Basic
	and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the three and nine months ended

	In

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	(“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation
	costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements
	over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
	restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation
	cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective
	vesting periods of the option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued
	to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505,

	Equity
	Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.
	In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the
	non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized
	over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.

	NOTE
	6 – GOING CONCERN






	 





	The
	Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
	of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source
	of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Under
	the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
	the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
	in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	During
	the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
	business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
	payment of expenses associated with reviewing or investigating any potential business ventures. The Company may experience a cash
	shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.




	 




	Historically,
	the Company has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and
	growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through
	loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s
	failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon its and its shareholders.




	 




	In
	the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming
	year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances, focus on a possible joint
	venture or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated
	above.

	involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving
	the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
	future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
	predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying
	the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
	the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties

	Background





	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name “China Advanced Technology” as the successor
	by merger to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. (“Vitalcare”). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent
	a holding company reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding
	Corporation, and Vitalcare, together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding
	Corporation subsequently reincorporated in Nevada by merger into China Advanced.




	 




	Vitalcare
	was in the business of administering medical clinics specializing in diabetes treatment. It was the successor to Network Financial
	Services, Inc. (“Network”), which went public in an underwritten offering in 1987. Network was engaged in mortgage

	of Westmark Mortgage from Primark Corporation. Westmark ceased operations at some time in 2006, and in 2006 ceased filing reports
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The corporate entity was thereafter known as Viking Consolidated, Inc. (2006), Tailor

	October 25, 2011, Goliath Film and Media International, a California corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
	(the “Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which Goliath Film and Media International was acquired by China Advanced
	Technology. Prior to the acquisition, our principal operations consisted of internet marketing, and were conducted through a wholly
	owned subsidiary, Live Wise, Inc. Live Wise was disposed of on October 31, 2011 for cancellation of debt and shares described
	below. At the Closing Date, there were no assets or liabilities on China Advanced Technology’s balance sheets.




	 




	The

	Goliath Film and Media International by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares
	after giving effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology’s prior
	control person. Immediately following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name
	of China Advanced Technology was changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings. All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an
	eight-for-1 forward stock split affected as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on

	Overview





	 




	Goliath
	Film and Media Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Goliath Film and Media International and Goliath Movie Partners
	1, LLC (collectively, “Goliath” or the “Company”), develops, produces and licenses for distribution, domestically
	and internationally, quality digital content with an emphasis on “niche” markets of the feature motion picture and
	television content segments of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, faith-based, horror and socially
	responsible minority content. Goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any
	significant extent.




	 




	In
	qualified cases, Goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production, but will be
	licensed for distribution through the Company. Also, in certain cases Goliath will produce content that is tied to working with
	an established distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed
	by the participating distributor. Goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally, through
	a wide distribution network which includes major international theatrical exhibitors, and other distributors and television networks.
	We plan to utilize corporate sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution. Further,
	we may augment our marketing efforts with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional “print”
	media with press releases targeted specifically toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an “as
	needed” basis as well as the inclusion of targeted “social media” campaigns.




	 




	Goliath’s
	revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees. A limited number of its content properties include projects developed
	and produced by Goliath and those produced by an independent third party production entity.

	We
	develop, produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content. At this time we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases
	of motion pictures, due to the high up- front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically. However, in some specific cases
	the company will consider theatrical releases based upon a “four wall, “limited release delivery that will be focused
	on targeted niche audiences.

	Mar Vista is looking to distribute this film.





	 





	On

	On
	May 20, 2015, we signed a distribution agreement with Mar Vista Entertainment, LLC to distribute a feature length motion picture

	during the period. Mar Vista is looking to distribute this film.




	 




	On
	April 15, 2015 Goliath signed an agreement whereby the Company agreed to invest $15,000 to KKO Productions to produce a feature
	length motion picture known as “Forgiven”. Per the agreement Goliath will receive 15% of adjusted gross proceeds after
	its initial investment has been entirely recouped through adjusted gross proceeds. Additionally, the Company will receive two
	on screen credits as Executive Producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising, publicity and packaging of the motion
	picture. The investment of $15,000 presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid, due to the fact that
	no revenues will be generated until this motion picture’s released.




	 





	What
	is the timeline for your activities during the next 12 months?





	 




	Over
	the next 90 days to one year, our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing
	by them of at least three projects.




	 





	What
	is this going to cost you?





	 




	We
	expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately $150,000 per project, however licensing and distribution
	will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from 30 – 35% and the costs of advertising and marketing
	will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds.

	Why
	are these motion pictures not being distributed already?






	 





	The
	motion pictures that are being produced by the Company and distributed by Mar Vista Entertainment, LLC take anywhere from six
	to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements.




	 




	Generically,
	the main reason why good, quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money
	and creativity, and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills. Many people dream of making a movie;
	few aspire to distribute them. We estimate that there are in excess of 10,000 such motion pictures “gathering dust.”
	There also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many States and international
	Territories, so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects.
	A secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor. We think that our management has an excellent reputation
	in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content. Finally, many distributors as well as buyers do
	not have an interest in niche market films, because they see the market as limited. Goliath sees the problem to be, rather, there
	is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches. Most participants in the motion picture
	industry are based in “Hollywood” and the major coastal metropolitan areas. Our “faith-based” films especially
	are targeted toward the “Bible Belt” and the “Flyover Country”: places that the industry has consistently
	overlooked.




	 





	Why
	are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos?






	 





	After
	attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years, our Staff has developed relationships
	with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath has also developed vital
	relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks. Many of the filmmakers have requested the Company’s
	assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product
	that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators, distributors, networks and studios.




	 





	So
	how are you different than Amazon, Netflix, Blockbuster and Hulu, to name a few? How can you compete with them? They have a lot
	of money and name recognition. Why wouldn’t they jump into your niches?





	 




	As
	a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content. As
	an example, NETFLIX has such a high demand for programming content, they are spending $5 billion this year for the acquisition
	of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them. Therefore, as is mentioned, part of their
	resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting in-house” and joint venture production of quality
	content. This content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level.




	 




	There
	are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors, Goliath is moving toward
	becoming one of these content providers. We believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand
	for programming is increasing almost exponentially. Irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumer/subscriber, the demand
	for quality content is continuing to expand. As an example there are currently, approximately 416 original scripted programs being
	aired in the entire television universe – a cancellation rate of 10% reflects a number that represents the entire programming
	universe in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s.. The upward trend is ongoing, which is where we see an opportunity for
	Goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market.




	 





	Don’t
	cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like TBN (for faith based) and BET (Black Entertainment Television
	(for the African-American Community)?





	 




	As
	mentioned above about NETFLIX, even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type, genre and format of
	the content that they are showing in order to remain viable, therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming
	is ongoing and expanding.




	 





	What
	other niches are you looking at entering?





	 




	We
	believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches. Many viewers have cable or satellite
	service with hundreds of channels, but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests. One significant type
	of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the United States. Other than Spanish speaking immigrants, coverage
	is scarce. The last official data (2004) from the US Census Bureau is that 34.2 million persons in the US are foreign born, with
	54% from Latin America, 25% from Asia and 14% from Europe. Foreign-born immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries.

	There
	are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming. As an example in Hawaii and Southern California,
	for instance, Surfing is quite popular, and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest.




	 





	What
	about ancillary markets?





	 




	We
	plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible.




	 





	What
	films do you have now in inventory?





	 




	We
	presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures:

	, Seducing Spirits, The Perfect Argument,
	Marina Murders, Film Struggle, Divorce in America, A Wonderful Summer, The Truth About Layla, Living with Cancer, The Biggest
	Fan, Days of Redemption, On Borrowed Time, Tumbleweed, Virus X, Farewell, Buddies, and The Pit

	. Under the distribution agreements
	Goliath will receive 30% of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute. In general, our distribution contracts
	cover both domestic and international licensing agreements; however, for the picture

	The Biggest Fan

	we obtained limited
	distribution rights.





	 






	How
	do these distribution rights work?





	 




	We
	enter into a Distribution Agreement for each motion picture. Terms may be perpetual or limited by years. The motion pictures that
	we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years. We will generally obtain a fee of 20% to 30%
	of gross revenues. Licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multi-year basis. Most markets, especially
	foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing.




	 





	How
	many employees do you have? Do you have an office?





	 




	We
	have just 3 employees and we believe that is sufficient during the development, production and “content aggregation”
	phase of our development. Our administrative office is in Marina del Rey, California.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 





	The
	SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
	financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments,
	often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified
	the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant
	to understanding our results. For additional information, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.




	 




	The
	following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the Company.




	 






	Principles
	of Consolidation








	 






	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances
	and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.




	 






	Basis
	of Presentation






	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing
	and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
	accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions
	are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present
	fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.

	Use
	of Estimates








	 






	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. The more significant estimates and assumptions
	by management include among others: Estimated revenue of films. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty
	inherent in these estimates and assumptions.




	 




	Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
	are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 






	Revenue
	Recognition






	 




	We
	recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 926-605, “Entertainment Films, Revenue Recognition”.




	 




	Under
	ASC 926-605, five conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered, (iii) the license period has begun, (vi) the price is fixed or determinable,
	and (v) collection is reasonably assured. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful account based history and experience
	considering economic and industry trends. The Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with
	all technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s
	rights system.




	 






	Accounts
	Receivable






	 




	Accounts
	receivable, if any are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will

	If there were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience,

	Intangible
	Assets






	 




	The
	Company’s intangible assets consist of intellectual property, principally motion pictures. The Company periodically reviews
	its long lived assets to ensure that their carrying value does not exceed their fair market value. There was no amortization expense
	or impairment for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 






	Income
	Taxes






	 




	We
	account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
	(“ASC”) No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC
	740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
	the enactment date.

	In
	accordance with ASC No. 718,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	(“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation
	costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements
	over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
	restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation
	cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective
	vesting periods of the option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued
	to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505,

	Equity
	Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.
	In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the
	non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized
	over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.




	 






	Accounting
	for Derivative Financial Instruments






	 




	We
	evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by ASC 815 and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items
	identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock.




	 






	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	We
	follow the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about
	fair value measurements.




	 




	We
	use fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common
	stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value.
	These require management’s judgment.




	 






	Fair
	Value Measurements







	 





	Effective
	beginning second quarter 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,

	Financial Instruments

	, requires disclosures about fair value of
	financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments
	and long-term debt. Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, clarifies the definition of
	fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
	the use of fair value measurements.




	 




	Various
	inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies
	used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These
	inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.




	 






	●




	Level
	1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,
	etc.).






	 




	 






	●




	Level
	3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
	investments).






	 




	The
	carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
	assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.
	The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
	statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at January
	31, 2017, assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature.




	 




	The
	availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including
	the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For
	many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted
	by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of January 31, 2017, the Company had
	no assets other than prepaid expenses and capitalized film production costs.

	Basic
	earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted Earnings per share
	is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may
	be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:

	The
	FASB ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings Per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings
	per share, assuming dilution.




	 




	Diluted
	earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
	the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained
	thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.




	 




	Basic
	and diluted earnings per share are the same as there were no potentially dilutive instruments for the three and nine months ended
	January 31, 2017 and 2016.

	of $569,657 as of January 31, 2017. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern. The Company’s management plan to continue as a going concern revolves around its ability to execute its business
	strategy of distributing films, as well as raising the necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of

	Lamont Roberts, the Company’s CEO, under which we issued 4,579,469 shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance
	with Rule 144, in exchange for $45,795. The issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
	of 1933, and the investor was sophisticated and familiar with our operations at the time of the issuance of the shares. During

	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures

	. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed,
	summarized, and reported accurately, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and within the required
	time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
	who is also our acting Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the
	end of the period covered by this report (January 31, 2017), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
	of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)).
	Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period
	covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to accurately
	record, process, summarize and report certain information required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings
	within the required time periods, and to accumulate and communicate to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
	Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
