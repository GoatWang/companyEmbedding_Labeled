BOSTON, July 11, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Inversiones y Servicios Publicitarios, SL ("ISP"), a company fully owned by the Rodes family, is pleased to announce the formation of ISP Digital and the appointment of Don Epperson as its Executive Chairman.
ISP Digital manages ISP's investments in Acceso, SA ("Acceso"), in Antevenio, SA (Euronext Paris: ALANT) ("Antevenio"), where the Rodes family owns a minority stake, and is also the largest shareholder, and in Digilant Marketing, SL ("Digilant").  Acceso provides tools and services to monitor, analyze and report on placed media and social influencers.  Antevenio manages category-specific and brand-sponsored content sites, provides eMail solutions to over 7,000 companies, and sells a wide range of digital media through its ad-network.  Digilant provides customized programmatic media solutions.  Combined these 3 companies employ over 600 people in 10 countries throughout Europe, the United States, and Latin America.
Over the last 15 years, ISP has founded and built a number of digital marketing and media services companies.  With the addition of Mr. Epperson, ISP now aims to consolidate and accelerate the group's capabilities, and to expand globally, organically and through acquisitions.  "At its core, ISP Digital will be a hub for managing paid, earned and owned media, leveraging the efficiencies of synergistic technology stacks and the opportunities of a common data science infrastructure. " said Mr. Epperson.
"Don is one of the industry's leading strategists and operators.  We're thrilled to be partnering with him again," said Gonzalo and Fernando Rodes, two of ISP Digital's founders and shareholders.  "ISP Digital provides a platform on which to build innovative marketing and media solutions for a global client base.  I'm excited to be leading this effort," said Mr. Epperson.
