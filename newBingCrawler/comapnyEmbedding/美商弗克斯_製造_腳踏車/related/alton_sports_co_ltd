January 14, 2014  by digitalbuyersguide Leave a Comment 
[INQ. NO. 1401C09] As cycling, which is associated with not only a clean mode of transport that does not generate greenhouse gas emissions, but also a good way of getting fit, has grown popular in Korea, Alton Sports Co., Ltd. has lately further enjoyed a stronger upside.
One of its flagship products, Alton Road Master R21 uses DP-780 frame, the first time for a bicycle in the world. Its bicycle frames are strong and sleeklooking, as well as safe and durable enough to meet higher expectation of riders. The intensity of DP780 is about 780Mpa, which makes it possible to have a much slimmer layer of bicycle frame, ultimately being as light as the highend chromoly frame.
The use of DP780 allows Alton Road Master R21 to have sleeker wheels and decals, providing comfortable ride with excellent elasticity. And the nature of the DP780 enables Alton to produce a new bike with thinner and sportier frame geometry. That’s why the Alton Road Master R21 is equipped with a 1″ head tube (not the standard 1-1/8″), custom-made handle stem, seat tube and seat post, instead of the standard products. It has also improved straightness by keeping the wheelbase toe clearance and rear wheel base as short as possible with overall compact shape.
The maneuverability and safety has also been emphasized by installing Shimano one-touch 21-speed shift lever and Shimano derailleur for better shifting as well as chain cover to keep the rider’s clothing from getting jammed in the chains. The bike weighs 11kg so that it is easy to move when people cannot ride.
And the combination of matt finish of steel and a vivid color has been chosen to highlight the new bike. The choice to commute on a bike is already an environmentally-friendly lifestyle by reducing gas and emissions in the air. On top of that, Alton has also adopted innovating DP-780 frame, which uses less natural resources, but is as light as the high-end Chrome-molybden alloyed steel and Carbone frames, contributing to the environment protection. 
Since its establishment in 1994, Alton Sports Co., Ltd. rewrote the history of the domestic bicycle industry. With its own plants in Korea and abroad, Alton has cooperated with automobile brands, and launched bikes with glamorous colors. From bikes that were simply used to carry luggage, customers now want a bike that is comfortable and safe on any kind of road, and has a sensual design that stands out. Alton Sports understand the needs and provides not only regular bikes but has also road, MTB, and electric models, which it sells under the brand names of CHEVROLET, ALTON, BENETTON, INFIZA and COREX at home and abroad.
As the only company in the country with a manufacturing plant, Alton has a production capacity of one million finished bikes. Establishing an electric bike plant in Korea to produce domestically made electric bikes, it also has yearly production capacity of 100,000 bicycles. As a leading bicycle exporter with its own plants in China, Alton Sports has extended its stage to the world markets, exporting a yearly average of 300,000 bikes to countries such as the United States, Russia, Poland, Japan, Taiwan and Indonesia.
Alton leads market changes with groundbreaking designs and a series of products for customer sensation. The company’s relentless R&D efforts yielded an innovative new material DP-780 frame grafted through cooperation with POSCO.

You are here: Home / Archives for Alton SportsA Leader of the Bicycle Culture in Korea
November 15, 2016  by digitalbuyersguide Leave a Comment  The story of Alton Sports is a story of a pioneer, braving the turbulence of the market and forging a new path to become the one and only self-producing bicycle brand in Korea.
Alton Sports is now preparing for an entirely new revolution with its affi liation with INNOX in 2016.
While the market conditions remain murky as ever with a low growth structure, unclear policy directions and sharp changes in trends, it will continue its journey to become a world-class bicycle manufacturer with an unwavering faith and leadership toward achieving its future vision.
With its goal to become a world-class market leader, Alton Sports has identifi ed management visions along with the goal of KRW 200 billion in sales. First, from manufacturing to logistics, sales and follow-up management, it will approach the entire process systematically to enhance the results. It will off er a diverse range of line-ups and models for the convenience and freedom of choice of customers.
By increasing its export capabilities, it will showcase the brand value of its name to the rest of the world. Lastly, it will off er not only highquality, but also a wider and more meaningful customer service.
Three Major Products that Represent Alton Sports and its Brands
Roadmaster, a hybrid bike and road bike brand that emphasizes speed and style, is built to dominate the road with fast and powerful riding.
This brand’s most representative model, Tochka, is a premier Fixie model that off ers streamlined aesthetics with its aero-type frame and 50mm high rim. The frame is made of Aluminum Fixie with 700 x 520 mm. Its crank set consists of Prowheel 46T Aluminum Chainwheel and Fixie Crank Arm. It weighs around 10.3kg and comes in black/red, black/yellow, yellow and navy.
Infi za’s road cycle product line maximizes the fun in riding with its unique composite material, which was based on the harmony of rigidity and elasticity. Infi za’s roda cycle product line was built with the dimensions of the average Korean in mind. Also, it is tailored to the terrain of the Korean Peninsula. Thus, Infi za’s road cycle model can provide unparalleled stability and comfort in riding.
Alton’s e-bikes utilize its patented internal batt ery design to minimize safety issues with regard to external factors such as rain or physical shock. E. Novatus 26 is made with a 26 x 457 internal batt ery smooth welding aluminum frame.
It is capable of being ridden over uneven terrain and in all road conditions.
