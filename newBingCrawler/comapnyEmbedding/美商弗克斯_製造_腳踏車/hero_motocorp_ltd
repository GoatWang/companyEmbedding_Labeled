The overall experience was unsatisfactory. The bike was not completely prepared for delivery. Washing, teflon-coating, and putting the seat cover were not done. We asked to do the above. After these things were done, we were about to leave, and then we realized that the button-start wire was not connected. The mechanic fixed it. Then we left and got the petrol tank filled in. To our surprise, the petrol indicator was not working. We went back and got it fixed. The whole process consumed more than two hours, whereas it was a matter of few minutes. After I started riding the bike, I realized that the clutch was too lose and gears were too hard. I had to go back to get it fixed. This is not the kind of service I expected from here. I hope the concerned authority will look into this matter and avoid further inconvenience. Thank you. 更多讚 · 留言 · 分享Akash Chauhan Rajput2015年7月20日 6:46Kalptru autopats讚 · 留言 · 分享更多大家都按讚的專頁Hero Moto Corp汽車公司Rattanpal Motors (Hero MotoCorp.)汽車公司Hero Riderz社群中文(台灣) · English (US) · Español · Português (Brasil) · Français (France)隱私政策 · 使用條款 · 廣告 · Ad Choices · Cookie · 更多 Facebook © 2017貼文Hero Motocorp Ltd. · 2012年9月10日 · Hero's King Karizma ZMRHero Motocorp Ltd. · 2012年9月10日 · Hero latest Bike Ignitor on the road顯示全部相片顯示全部貼文Hero Motocorp Ltd. · 2012年9月9日 · Dil dheere dhadke hai aaj Hone ko hai aaghaaz Safar pe Chalne ka badhne ka                     Itna hai Hausla Mitna faasla⋯⋯  Manzil ne mil hi jaana hai  O Dil dheere dhadke hai aaj Hone ko hai aaghaaz Safar pe Chalne ka badhne ka  Itna hai Hausla Mitna faasla  Manzil ne mil hi jaana hai  O..

Mr. Pawan Munjal explain this campaign as a true sense of  Indian Catapult which signals that although its roots are very Indian it is ready for global expansion. The new logo of Hero is specially designed to relate the youth and their 'can do' spirit.    'Hum main hai hero' is surely one of the best ad in recent time. 更多Hero Motocorp Ltd. · 2012年9月9日 · hero launch first scooterHero Motocorp Ltd. · 2012年9月9日 · Hero launch first bike of brand name Hero ImpulseHero Motocorp Ltd. 更新了封面相片。 · 2012年9月9日 · 查看更多

Hero MotoCorp, the Automobile Giant, has chosen Matrix Access Control Solution to Secure their Kukas, Jaipur Premises.
Project Highlights:
Application: Access Control
Users: 1,000+
Devices: 330+
Locations: Kukas, Jaipur (Single Location)
Readers: Fingerprint (with Optical Sensor)
Industry: Automobile, Manufacturing
Hero MotoCorp Ltd.
Hero MotoCorp, the Automobile Giant, has chosen Matrix Access Control Solution to secure their Kukas, Jaipur Premises.
Company Profile:
Hero MotoCorp Ltd., formerly Hero Honda, is one of the India’s largest motorcycle and scooter manufacturers based in New Delhi with a market share of about 46% in the two-wheelers category. In 2001, the company achieved the coveted position of being the largest two-wheeler manufacturing company in India. It is the ‘World No.1’ two-wheeler company in terms of unit volume sales in a calendar year. Hero MotoCorp Ltd. continues to maintain this position till date.
Challenges:
Being a manufacturing unit, the basic requirement of Hero MotoCorp was to restrict any unauthorized access in sensitive areas. They were in search of the right vendor who could provide them with a zone based Access Control solution to restrict entry of a person from one zone to another. E.g.: A Coating Department employee should not be allowed access into the Assemble Department.  Furthermore, devices with good aesthetics and ease to install were required as part of prime solution.
Solution Offered:
Matrix pitched its Access Control solution, which fulfils 100% requirements of Hero MotoCorp. Additionally, instead of door controllers, Matrix provided IP based Single Door Controller, COSEC ARC DC100P along with entry and exit readers to meet the standard DIN Rail mounting. COSEC ARC, as a single door IP panel and COSEC PATH RDFE, as entry and exit readers have been installed to secure their premises.
Two requirements for Access Control were:

Restrict Unauthorized Access
Zone-wise Access

Restricting unauthorised access was the basic requirement for implementing an access control solution. However, zone-wise access control was really challenging with 100+ entry points. For this, Matrix provided COSEC PANEL LITE, which comes with a feature that allows creation of different groups of devices on the basis of different zones.
Results:
Hero MotoCorp secured the premises with Matrix Access Control solution and achieved the following results:

Increased Overall Security by Restricting Unauthorized Access
Zone-wise Access Control

The Products:
COSEC ARC DC100P – Single Door Panel with PoE for Access Control Application
COSEC PATH RDFE –  Fingerprint and Card based Exit Reader with IP65
COSEC PANEL LITE –  Control Panel to support Multiple Door Controllers for Advance Features
COSEC CENTRA LE –  Application Server Platform with 1,000 Users and Expandable up to One Million
Users for basic Access Control and Raw Event Data
COSEC LE ACM – Access Control Software Module for COSEC CENTRA LE Users
