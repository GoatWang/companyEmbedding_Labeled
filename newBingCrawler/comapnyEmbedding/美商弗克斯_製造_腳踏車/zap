Zap! – Product Review

Posted on May 3, 2016  by  sam 




I’m sure you’ve all heard the Television Commercials for Zap.  It was available a few years ago, and then it just disappeared from the shelves.  Walmart got it in again for under $5.00.  This is my experience with this product.


What’s inside?
The bottle of Zap! Professional Restorer, a replacement lid with a spout & a heavy duty scrubbing pad.

My sink is old and stained.  Usually, I have to put cleanser on the entire sink, let it soak for a little while, scrub until my fingers hurt, and then still have to fill the sink with hot water & bleach to get it really clean looking.  It’s a lot of work and with out the work, the sink is embarrassing.
I’ve used Zap! before & loved it.  Why?  Because it works on contact with almost no scrubbing.  This is a picture of just a few drops on the sink.

This is the sink that I have to deal with everyday.
  
I put the Zap! on the entire sink & let it soak for a few minutes.  Already a remarkable difference.

This is the sink after letting the Zap! sit on it for about 3-4 minutes, with no scrubbing.  All that was left to do was to rinse it out.
  
I’d say there’s quite a difference!

I highly recommend Zap!  It works just as well as it did when it was first available and the price is better now.

Happy Creating everyone!

History[edit]
ZAP Power Systems (for zero air pollution), was launched by Jim McGreen in 1992 with the goal of designing, building and selling innovative electric vehicles. The company was incorporated on September 23, 1994 as ZAP Power Systems[2] of Sebastopol, California, by McGreen, Gary Starr where they started manufacturing electric powered kits and bikes and then later the zappy scooter.[3] In 1993 Automotive News named Starr among the top ten authorities in the electric car industry.[4] He had previous experience with electric cars, including his work at Solar Electric Engineering[5] and U.S. Electricar, which converted hundreds of vehicles including trucks for Ford and General Motors and is currently known as Enova Systems.[6] Starr was involved in electric conversion projects, various production cars and kit cars.[7]

CALSTART,"Gary Starr has probably been responsible for the marketing of more EVs than anyone I can think of," said CALSTART CEO Mike Gage. "Responsible for more than 20 thousand, I think that is more than all the tier one automakers." [21]

ZAP Electric Vehicles[edit]
The company operates a retail car lot for sales of its automotive product line which includes the ZAPTRUCK XL and ZAPVAN Shuttle, two low-speed vehicles for the fleet market, the ZAP Xebra Truck and Sedan, also develops and commercializes electric power-assist system motor kits for bicycles, as well as electric bicycles, electric ATVs and personal electric scooters.

(ZAP World Outlet, ZAP Rental Outlet and RAP Group are not currently operating subsidiaries).
ZAP Recharge-It-All[edit]
This division is focused on Portable Energy (batteries), the company through the Recharge-It-All line sells battery packs to power or charge a range of mobile electronics such as cellular phones, digital cameras and laptops, providing significantly more charge time than available technologies.[44] The Portable Energy devices fall under two product lines. It includes the universal chargers and iPOD models and the iPhone.[45] The universal chargers are rechargeable battery packs that extend the use of small and medium-sized electronic devices up to two to five times their normal battery life.
Fleets[edit]
The reorganized ZAP's market strategy was announced to cover fleet needs, with four tangible products launched until date,[46] the ZAP Xebra(2006), ZAP Dude(2008), ZAP Truck XL(2008) and the ZAP Shuttle Van(2008).
ZAP Xebra[edit]




The Zap Xebra 2007 Chicago Auto Show


The ZAP Xebra[47] is a three-wheeled all-electric city car capable of 40 mph (64 km/h), charges off of a 110 volt outlet. Serves Domino's Pizza delivery service in Las Vegas,[48] Aspen[49] in the USA, Coca-Cola distribution model in Montevideo, Uruguay and includes an adapted version: The Xebra Truck.[50] The United Parcel Service (UPS) in Northern California combines a fleet of Xebra trucks and sedans to expand small parcel deliveries, after UPS delivery vans transfer smaller packages to locked storage unit, an electric Xebra car/truck transports packages into dense urban and residential areas where parking and traffic are easier for the smaller vehicles.[51] After several hundred vehicles produced, the production of this vehicle have been phased out since 2009.[52]

Xebra Legal Issues: Massachusetts

According to a July 31, 2008, editorial in Wired Magazine, motorists in Massachusetts are unable to register the ZAP Xebra legally, because the vehicle doesn't fit the state's definition of either a car or a motorcycle. Registrants of ZAP Xebras received letters from the state's Registry of Motor Vehicles stating that their vehicle registration plates had been revoked and their registrations were invalid.[53]

Resolution

Both the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate found it as an nihilism, when they passed the legislation on December 31, allowing three-wheeled motor vehicles in Boston roads. The change was achieved through joint efforts by the Registry of Motor Vehicles, state Senator Robert L. Hedlund, a Weymouth Republican, and state Representative Garrett J. Bradley, a Hingham Democrat.[54]
ZAP Dude[edit]
The electric four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle ZAP Dude ATV, designed for installation security patrols and maintenance functions, can go up to 25 mph (40 km/h) and has a range of 25 miles (40 km) with a 48 volt permanent-magnet brush DC motor and standard 65 amp hour absorbed glass mat (AGM) lead acid batteries,[55] fact that sacrifices charging time to 4 to 6 hours and the continuous power to 4 kW, both indicators improvable with a lithium battery technology. Is the cheapest in the company's electric vehicle portfolio, been introduced to natural reserve patrols, US Military[56] and agriculture and farming markets,[57] where usage is scheduled and power stations are strategically located.

The ZAPTRUCK XL classifies as a Zero Emission Vehicle(ZEV), with an off-road payload up to 1,900 lb (860 kg) and a convertible truck bed, have served a small contractor company from California, Ghilotti Construction Co., to move parts off site,[59] UPS delivery services have also add the four-wheeled vehicle mostly to its Bay Area parcel fleet needs,[60][61] the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have added the vehicle to their transportation operating mode.[62] The U.S. Military has been putting the vehicle to test by engaging them into logistics tasks since 2009.[63]
Under development[edit]
ZAP-X[edit]
The ZAP-X is an electric crossover SUV previously expected to be launched in 2008 by ZAP and Lotus Engineering based on the Lotus APX prototype platform.[64] The claimed potential performance was a total of 644 bhp (480 kW; 653 PS) from four in-wheel electric motors, a 350-mile (560 km) single-charge range, 155 mph (249 km/h) top speed, 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration in 4.8 seconds and a 10-minute recharge time, with an estimated production cost of over $395 million together with the Alias.[65] This product have not been offered for sale to the public.
ZAP Electric SUV/Taxi[edit]
ZAP is developing the ZAP Electric SUV/Taxi, an all-electric family SUV, tested at the Korea Electric Vehicle Challenge from March to early April,[66] an on-road multistage demonstration event of three rest and recharge stops that includes a 220 km freeway rally at average speeds of 80–85 km/h(52.8 mph).[67] Vehicle presented ahead of the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition by the CEO of ZAP, Steve Schneider, as the company latest effort.[68] The model also available with a fuel efficient engine based on Jonway's A380 platform,.[69]
ZAP Alias[edit]
Main article: ZAP Alias
The ZAP Alias Roadster is a plug-in electric three-wheeled sports car from the American electric car maker ZAP that was originally scheduled to go into production in 2009, with two wheels at the front, each containing an electric wheel-motor, and one at the rear, the project initiated in 2007 through a collaboration between ZAP and Lotus Engineering, the UK-based automotive engineering company, who are assisting with the development of the vehicle.[70] Was supposed to have gone into production in 2009.[71] The performance announced in 2008, was 0-60 mph (97 km/h) mph in 5.7 seconds, with a top speed of 156 mph (251 km/h) mph and a range of 100 miles (160 km).[70] The vehicle was a finalist at the 2010 Progressive Insurance X Prize[72] driven by Al Unser, Jr., but was eliminated due to mechanical failure in the 97th mile of a 100-mile track event.[73][74]
Controversy[edit]
ZAP has had a history of production delays. While the company sold the low-end Xebra for a number of years, more expensive, higher-performance models have been repeatedly announced but not produced.
A feature article in the April 2008 issue of Wired alleged that "ZAP has taken millions from investors and dealers eager to see the company's line of green cars hit the road. But that line has never materialized." The article alleges that board members issued themselves large amounts of company stock and warrants and made misleading claims about the company's prospects, allowing them to enrich themselves at the expense of dealers who bought franchises and did not receive the cars that they were expecting to sell. While the company sold the low-end Xebra for a number of years, more expensive, higher-performance models have been repeatedly announced but not produced. [75] An article from Forbes magazine in June 2007 criticizes the company for over-issuing stock and failing to produce results or show significant profits.[76]
ZAP did reportedly become the first company in the USA to sell the micro Smart Car. According to greenchipstocks, In 2004 Daimler Chrysler abandoned their Smart Car division in the U.S., claiming there was not enough demand. In 2005, ZAP took the initiative and started Americanizing Smart Cars they purchased from European dealers. In doing so they secured orders totaling in $2.2 billion. [77]
In the case ZAP v. Daimler Chrysler AG, et al., Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC342211. On October 28, 2005, ZAP filed a complaint against Daimler Chrysler Corporation and others in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The complaint includes claims for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations, trade libel, defamation, breach of contract - agreement to negotiate in good faith, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair competition. The complaint alleges that Daimler Chrysler has engaged in a series of anti-competitive tactics aimed at defaming ZAP and disrupting its third-party business relationships. As a result of the allegations, the complaint requests damages in excess of $500 million and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. [78]
ZAP sold shares and dealer franchises, partially based on its intention to sell and finance the retrofitting of the Smart Car to USA standards. The importation and conversion to meet US safety and EPA regulations was engineered and performed by G&K Automotive of Santa Ana, CA. Zap quoted mileage figures for the car as being the mid 40 range. This calculation was taken from UK test figures and was based on the larger(+20%) Imperial gallon. When tested by the EPA at their Ann Arbor lab, it was found that true mpg figures were in the low to mid 30's, but Daimler-Chrysler, the Smart car's manufacturer, said that ZAP's behavior revealed "both the sham nature of its purported business and a lack of trustworthiness that is nothing short of stunning." Although ZAP never claimed to have a deal with Daimler Chrysler directly, according to filed reports ZAP was the first company to import Smart cars to the USA and did sell 300 Smart cars that it bought from independent Daimler-Chrysler distributors, it also filed suit against Daimler-Chrysler in California for Libel and Business Interference. ZAP lost the initial filings and also subsequent appeals based solely on jurisdiction.[79][80]
Franklin, Kentucky[edit]
Plans to begin construction of a manufacturing plant in Franklin, Kentucky, were announced in late summer 2008, but construction plans were halted in November 2008.[81][82]

Start Zapping! Upvote (3)Share·2 years agoBrandon Waselnuk@brandonwaselnuk · CEO, Co-Founder Tattoo heroAfter playing around with Zap I was pretty damn impressed with the information they dig up from the web on the people you connect with. The recap emails are really well put together! Upvote (3)Share·2 years agoMike MasonMaker@tipeveryday · Don't believe everything you think.thanks @brandonwaselnuk  - we think you're really well put together. Upvote (1)Share·2 years agoSidney Zhang@sidazhang · UberI use Android so I can't really test this.

Curious, Does this require both people to use Zap? Does Zap still have utilities if it is just one person? Upvote (3)Share·2 years agoMike MasonMaker@tipeveryday · Don't believe everything you think.@sidazhang  
1/We have an android build, it just needs polishing. 3 weeks out
2/If you want to send your card to a recipient that does not have the app we use the iOS share sheet to send a deeplink (through any app with share sheet integration). The recipient is prompted to download the app and receive the card ---> http://zappp.co/d Upvote Share·2 years agoVivek M George@vivekmgeorge · SALT - trysalt.com@sidazhang @tipeveryday  why not make it so the other person didn't need download the app to see the card but they could still see where it came from, ie. hotmail when it launched. If get this, I might be like I don't want to download another app and not save the contact at all. Love to hear your thoughts. Congrats on the launch! Upvote (2)Share·2 years agoSidney Zhang@sidazhang · Uber@tipeveryday  I wish you could make it so that I don't need to download the app to get the contact. I think that actually reduces the utility of this app. 

Because as result, I am less likely to use Zap because I don't want to have to force everybody else to have to download Zap. Upvote (2)Share·2 years agoMike MasonMaker@tipeveryday · Don't believe everything you think.@vivekmgeorge @sidazhang  we've thought about this a lot. There are ups and downs to it and a few potential security breaches of information. We've thought about using a combination of programmatic screenshot with a .vcf file (works on ios and Android). This would eliminate the need for the recipient to have the app (it will however reduce the value of all the stuff we do in the background like meeting recaps and links to social channels to continue the relationship online).

If you solve this problem treating business card 2.0 as if it's a feature parity replacement of the business card then you can never 10x the value and replace the incumbent. The value of “zapping” someone is what happens afterward. We give you insights into what the sender has been saying online, recap the meeting via detailed email notification and help you further the connection in the days following.

Let me know what you think about this. Upvote (1)Share·2 years agoVivek M George@vivekmgeorge · SALT - trysalt.com@tipeveryday I wrote a thoughtful, two paragraph response (twice). Unfortunately if you touch tab or command (or some combo) while writing a comment you lose it. I can't do it again so if you want to chat I be happy provide some additional feedback via a more traditional communication - vivek@trysalt.com or 917-515-2432.
