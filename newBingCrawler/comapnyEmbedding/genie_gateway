Genie Gateway Launches New Website for GenieCard Users







Alternative Payments Innovator Genie Gateway is Advancing Its Unique Debit Card Product to a Wider Audience 

Las Vegas, Nevada – January 25, 2016 – Nevada based Genie Gateway announced that this week they are rolling out their new website http://www.GenieCard.com , dedicated to their GenieCard – a totally secure debit card instrument designed to address the needs of tens of thousands of unbanked merchants and their customers.  An extension of the company’s Genie CashBox and Check 22, the GenieCard – first introduced in October of 2015 – makes it even easier for merchants and their customers to do business without using cash, even for those without access to traditional banking services. 

Thomas E. Skala, Genie Gateway CEO said “The GenieCard.Com website is the new way for merchants and customers to get to know the GenieCard.   Imagine a debit card, with complete privacy, convenience, and security, designed specifically for unbanked merchants and their customers; a debit card which doesn’t contain any of your personal information – not even your name –  just your ten digit card number. “Every day we are robbed of a little more of the privacy that we all cherish so much. Most people do not like living in a ‘glass house’, and are fighting to preserve what precious little privacy they have left. Smart shoppers wisely prefer not to share their credit card, banking information – or even their home phone number – online or when making purchases by phone”. Visitors to the website can request the cards, which are not personalized in any way, and activate the cards by cell phone or on the Internet.  They can then use the cards for phone, online, mobile-based or in-person transactions with any merchant or individual who uses the Genie Gateway service. The company also distributes the cards, free of charge to it merchant customers, who can dispense them to their own customers for activation and use.  “The GenieCard combines the best of TWO worlds,” explained Genie Gateway COO Randal Skala, ”the Genie Club – our closed loop member service, which utilizes the Genie CashBox –  and Check22, the open loop service which lets members access their funds from any checking account, in any bank in the US. Stuart Scamman, CTO of Genie Gateway, expanded. “Given the high-tech methods used by hackers, which are advancing every day, the time to take steps to protecting your privacy is now! GenieCard is that next step,”  “The GenieCard is the fastest and safest way to send payments online, via mobile devices, in store or by phone, making it both easy AND safe for unbanked merchants and their customers to do business, WITHOUT using cash and WITHOUT sharing financial information”. Mark Newgreen, Genie Gateway CFO, then went into detail, “If the balance in your CashBox is enough to cover your purchase, then it’s processed automatically as a real-time, Peer-to-Peer payment. If your balance isn’t enough for the purchase, then your payment is processed automatically as a debit to the checking account you provided in your original Genie CashBox application.” The GenieCard will be a major game changer and everyone over the age of 18, with a valid checking account at any U.S. bank can qualify.





NO Activation Fee


NO Monthly Fee


NO credit check


NO employment verification


NO credit card needed


Merchants get paid in Real-Time


“The GenieCard will change transaction processing for unbanked merchants; customers get to shop with privacy and convenience, and merchants get paid in real-time,” concluded Thomas E. Skala, Genie Gateway CEO.

Genie TV Recovers Idle Advertising Assets for Media Providers  











Alternative Payments Innovator Helps Companies Monetize Their “Missed Opportunities”  

Las Vegas, Nevada – December 1, 2015 – Nevada based Genie Gateway announced the creation of Genie TV, the next step in their suite of solutions  linking tens of thousands of unbanked merchants and their customers to the world of eCommerce. Designed to both disrupt traditional methods of eCommerce and engage an entire new class of merchants, Genie TV is also a mechanism for media providers to recoup profits from lost advertising.  

Thomas E. Skala, Genie Gateway CEO explained “Cable TV companies, Wireless Internet providers, Radio Stations, and Newspapers, all have inventories of a ‘Perishable Commodities’ - their unsold advertising.  

“That’s an asset that just disappears,” Skala continued. “If you don’t sell it before airtime or publication, you can’t bank it… until now.” 

“Traditionally, media providers with unsold advertising space or airtime run ‘house ads’ to fill the void,” Thomas A. Nix, President of Genie TV, explained, “Genie TV gives them an alternative, with an opportunity to convert that unsold advertising into long term residual revenues, while helping Unbanked Merchants and Individuals learn about new solutions and new ways they can join today’s eCommerce / online society.”

Thomas Nix expanded, “Genie TV will provide videos, commercials, and infomercials, which can replace unsold advertising and when new customers subscribe to the service, anytime they make a purchase, from any merchant, our advertising partners will generate residual income on all sales conducted by the merchants and for purchases made by consumers.”   

Genie TV CTO Roger Pace then went into detail, “The commercials, videos and related network links are more than just another advertisement.  First, the services advertised are expressly targeted at unbanked merchants and their customers – a huge, underserved market.  But more important, when a merchant or customer adopts the Genie services, the media provider running the ad in their otherwise ‘dead’ space will directly receive fee-based residual revenue, for the life of that buyer’s service usage.”  

“Genie TV will create an entirely new source of profit for the media provider, by tying them directly into the economic activity of an almost completely untapped market, for nothing more than the use of an existing ‘lost’ asset,” concluded Mark Newgreen, Genie Gateway CFO.

Publisher's Description+


                From  GenieGateway: 


    Genie Gateway, a publically owned company (U. S. OTC trading symbol: GGWY), (www.GGWY. Info), is a direct processor and a provider of alternative payment services; we are seeking relationships in which we can provide ecommerce and other business services to the next generation of both high risk and low risk entrepreneurs, starting at Discount Fee as low as 1. 95%, for some merchants. Genie Gateway holds the Key to Unlocking a Wide-Open Opportunity by using its patented technology to create an environment where un-banked and underserved customers, can communicate and send and receive payments, globally, in real-time, through Telecommunications, eCommerce, Cable TV, and High Speed Internet, traditionally purchased from several vendors - into one seamless service. Genie Gateway is an interactive multimedia communications hub, featuring a digital buffet of unified solutions; combining the benefits of having a website fully accessible from any internet enabled device, with voice, text, video, document messaging, virtual fax, group communications, including an online store, a shopping cart with a virtual point of sale, and a CashBox integrated with a GenieCard and GenieChecking accounts, plus the most robust Virtual Office, as one unified solution. Buyers NO longer need to provide their credit card, or bank account information, to make a payment. Repeat customers ONLY need their cell number, and "Click to OK" their purchase on their cell phone.

Genie Gateway Launches New Website for GenieCard Users







Alternative Payments Innovator Genie Gateway is Advancing Its Unique Debit Card Product to a Wider Audience 

Las Vegas, Nevada – January 25, 2016 – Nevada based Genie Gateway announced that this week they are rolling out their new website http://www.GenieCard.com , dedicated to their GenieCard – a totally secure debit card instrument designed to address the needs of tens of thousands of unbanked merchants and their customers.  An extension of the company’s Genie CashBox and Check 22, the GenieCard – first introduced in October of 2015 – makes it even easier for merchants and their customers to do business without using cash, even for those without access to traditional banking services. 

Thomas E. Skala, Genie Gateway CEO said “The GenieCard.Com website is the new way for merchants and customers to get to know the GenieCard.   Imagine a debit card, with complete privacy, convenience, and security, designed specifically for unbanked merchants and their customers; a debit card which doesn’t contain any of your personal information – not even your name –  just your ten digit card number. “Every day we are robbed of a little more of the privacy that we all cherish so much. Most people do not like living in a ‘glass house’, and are fighting to preserve what precious little privacy they have left. Smart shoppers wisely prefer not to share their credit card, banking information – or even their home phone number – online or when making purchases by phone”. Visitors to the website can request the cards, which are not personalized in any way, and activate the cards by cell phone or on the Internet.  They can then use the cards for phone, online, mobile-based or in-person transactions with any merchant or individual who uses the Genie Gateway service. The company also distributes the cards, free of charge to it merchant customers, who can dispense them to their own customers for activation and use.  “The GenieCard combines the best of TWO worlds,” explained Genie Gateway COO Randal Skala, ”the Genie Club – our closed loop member service, which utilizes the Genie CashBox –  and Check22, the open loop service which lets members access their funds from any checking account, in any bank in the US. Stuart Scamman, CTO of Genie Gateway, expanded. “Given the high-tech methods used by hackers, which are advancing every day, the time to take steps to protecting your privacy is now! GenieCard is that next step,”  “The GenieCard is the fastest and safest way to send payments online, via mobile devices, in store or by phone, making it both easy AND safe for unbanked merchants and their customers to do business, WITHOUT using cash and WITHOUT sharing financial information”. Mark Newgreen, Genie Gateway CFO, then went into detail, “If the balance in your CashBox is enough to cover your purchase, then it’s processed automatically as a real-time, Peer-to-Peer payment. If your balance isn’t enough for the purchase, then your payment is processed automatically as a debit to the checking account you provided in your original Genie CashBox application.” The GenieCard will be a major game changer and everyone over the age of 18, with a valid checking account at any U.S. bank can qualify.

        Genie Gateway, a publically owned company (U. S. OTC trading symbol: GGWY), (www.GGWY. Info), is a direct processor and a provider of alternative payment services; we are seeking relationships in which we can provide ecommerce and other business services to the next generation of both high risk and low risk entrepreneurs, starting at Discount Fee as low as 1. 95%, for some merchants. Genie Gateway holds the Key to Unlocking a Wide-Open Opportunity by using its patented technology to create an environment where un-banked and underserved customers, can communicate and send and receive payments, globally, in real-time, through Telecommunications, eCommerce, Cable TV, and High Speed Internet, traditionally purchased from several vendors - into one seamless service. Genie Gateway is an interactive multimedia communications hub, featuring a digital buffet of unified solutions; combining the benefits of having a website fully accessible from any internet enabled device, with voice, text, video, document messaging, virtual fax, group communications, including an online store, a shopping cart with a virtual point of sale, and a CashBox integrated with a GenieCard and GenieChecking accounts, plus the most robust Virtual Office, as one unified solution. Buyers NO longer need to provide their credit card, or bank account information, to make a payment. Repeat customers ONLY need their cell number, and "Click to OK" their purchase on their cell phone.
