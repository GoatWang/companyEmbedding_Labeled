Guaranteed Energy Savings Projects

Ecosave’s Guaranteed Energy Savings Project (GESP) extends and improves upon the standard ‘audit and install’ approach, to create a fully integrated, end-to-end service backed by a performance-based contract. Ecosave will manage the upgrade from start to finish and guarantee the implementation and all of the savings – features usually only found in large scale Energy Performance Contracts.












Energy Performance Contracts

Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is a low risk method of implementing energy and water efficiency projects across a single large property or portfolio of properties. The consumption savings proposed in an EPC are guaranteed for the full term of the contract, usually between seven and 15 years. The longer payback period and robust risk management enable larger energy and water infrastructure upgrades, plus installation of new plant and equipment, including onsite generation.












Funding

Energy and water efficiency makes good sense, the economic business case stacks up. But capital is not always available to invest in projects that are not core business. Ecosave offers a range of funding solutions to help get your project up and running. Better still, the investment will be cash flow positive, enabling you to still make savings during the repayment stage.












Building Automation and Energy Management

Ecosave Automation offers Building Automation Systems in new builds and retrofits. Our BAS can traverse your entire existing network, either wirelessly or wired. We design bespoke control sequences to automatically detect, diagnose and correct failures and energy wastage, saving you time and money. Support services include maintenance, reporting and utility bill management. For even greater, sustained savings our Energy Management service provides an Ecosave engineer to manage and monitor your consumption in real time, using our powerful and flexible web-based tool to continually identify opportunities to reduce your consumption.











How We Do It





Ecosave offers a unique service which maximizes savings and minimizes risks through guaranteed savings, fixed price proposals and end to end service.














Savings Guarantee

All of the savings that Ecosave propose are guaranteed. If the guarantee is not met, we will carry out additional work free of charge, or refund enough of the project value to achieve the guaranteed payback.












Free Assessments

Given certain criteria are met, Ecosave offers detailed, free energy/water savings opportunity assessments of your sites. And because we offer fixed price projects with guaranteed savings, our solutions must be comprehensively designed and specified. Our savings are calculated to a high level of accuracy.












End to End Service

Your organisation will be assigned a project team – the same engineers will work on your project from beginning to end through the assessment, solutions design, installation, commissioning and measurement and verification of savings using international verification standards.












Fixed Price Proposals

The results of our Assessments are presented in a Fixed Price Proposal with a single fee for the entire project from start to finish – there are no hidden costs.












Product Independent

We do not own, manufacture or have exclusive distribution rights to any products. This leaves us free to create the optimal design with the most value based, multi-technology package of solutions that are fit for purpose, maximizing savings.












Holistic, Engineering Based Solutions

We take a holistic view of consumption across an organisation, finding savings and efficiencies in all areas of energy and water use. Our team of qualified experts has Mechanical, Electrical and Mechatronic Engineers, Energy and Water Efficiency Specialists, Environmental Scientists, and Project Managers.












Implementation Warranty

Ecosave guarantees the implementation phase including all of the proposed solutions – if a solution fails or does not operate as intended, Ecosave will fix or replace it under the 12 months parts and labor warranty.












Fully Funded Projects

Ecosave offers a range of funding options for our projects, from Finance to fully off-balance sheet Service Agreements.

The Ecosave Services Agreement (ESA) delivery model allows clients to fund energy efficiency building upgrades over the long-term as an operating expense. Under an ESA, Ecosave delivers building upgrades and ongoing services that are funded from the energy savings delivered by the ESA. The client benefits from building upgrades and reduced operating expenses, without the need to invest their own capital or take on debt.








Utility Management Solutions
Ecosave’s Utility Management Solutions take data logging and monitoring to the next level, providing experienced Ecosave engineers who will manage your consumption on a monthly basis. Solutions include Bill Management, Building Monitoring, and Energy and Water Management. Your organisation will have visibility over consumption with easy access to information via a flexible, web-based display. This powerful management tool helps Ecosave identify ongoing opportunities to drive your consumption down.
