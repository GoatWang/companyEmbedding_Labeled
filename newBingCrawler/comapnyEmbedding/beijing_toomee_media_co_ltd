CSSC:
                    This year, our exhibiting slogan is ‘To lead the development of offshore engineering equipment. To forge a powerful nation in marine and offshore industry.’ On this excellent exhibition platform, we are exhibiting our latest design and products. It helps us accumulate valuable experiences in participating in the relevant offshore engineering events. 

Panama Maritime Authority:
                    The economic and trade relations between China and Panama in marine industry has been prosperous, which creates tremendous business opportunities for enterprises of the two countries. Exhibiting at CM is our first step to further exploring China market. We believe that there will be more companies from Panama getting involved in China market in the future. And we also welcome more companies from China to do business in Panama.

CNOOC
                    It is our pleasure to participate in this event every year. The event has been growing very quickly with the scale and quality bigger and better every year. And the equipments and technologies being exhibited here are great! The concurrent conferences and seminars are also very good...

CIMF RAFFLES:
                    This time we are mainly exhibiting offshore rigs and special vessels. We have welcomed many professional visitors and also met some shipowners, which is very good. We made a big breakthrough in order delivery and sales in 2013.In the future, we are going to continue to explore and integrate resources, improve offshore designing capacity, enrich the existing production line and upgrade our offshore industry chain.

Guangdong Yuexin Ocean Engineering:
                    We have brought 5 offshore support vessels to CM this year.It’s an interesting event by its complete coverage of the marine and offshore industry. We have met many shipowners from domestic and abroad, some of which are already our buyers. After 10 years of hard work,we have built Yuexin into one of the leading offshore engineering corporations in South China. Our vessels have been exported to South East Asia, Middle East, Europe and USA...

L & H:
                    It is our first time to exhibit at CM. We are very impressed by its scale and internationalization.As one of the leading technology-driven R&D company and service provider in the offshore engineering industry, at CM 2014,we have not only met our old key customers like CNOOC and CNPC who have been in cooperation with us for many years,but also met some world famous shipowners like Ulstein, McDermott etc...

HELKAMA:
                    It’s a great pleasure participate in CM again. Our product, the NEK 606 Offshore Calbe has been recently certificated by ABS and many other clasification societies, the cable is widely uesed in FPSO,Drilling Ship, FSU and many other offshore Engineering equipments.We had a successful show last year at CM 2013 and we are expecting to meet with more professional purchasers this year.
