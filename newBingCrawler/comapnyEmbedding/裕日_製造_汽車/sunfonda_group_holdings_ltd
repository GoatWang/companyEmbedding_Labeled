Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited Provides Earnings Guidance for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 26 17
Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited provides earnings guidance for the six months ended June 30, 2017. For the period, the company expected that there would be a substantial increase in the Group's consolidated profit for the six months ended 30 June 2017, and that the profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 would be not less than 400% of that for the same period last year. The Board believes that the increase in profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was mainly attributed to improvement of the Group's operational integrated management efficiency; significant increase in gross profit margin of new automobiles as a result of the major brands' prominent performance with more clear advantage of the brand portfolio; and stable growth in income from after-sales services with rapid development of other derivative businesses.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

POSITIVE PROFIT ALERT...







      Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited take no responsibility for the contents of this announcement, make no representation as to its accuracy or completeness and expressly disclaim any liability whatsoever for any loss howsoever arising from or in reliance upon the whole or any part of the contents of this announcement.
    

      SUNFONDA GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED
    

      新豐泰集團控股有限公司
    

      (Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability)
    

      (Stock Code: 01771)
    

      POSITIVE PROFIT ALERT
    

      This announcement is made by the Company pursuant to the Inside Information Provisions under Part XIVA of the SFO and Rule 13.09 of the Listing Rules.
    

      Based on a preliminary assessment, the Board wishes to inform the Shareholders and potential investors that, it is expected that there would be a substantial increase in the Group's consolidated profit for the six months ended 30 June 2017, and that the profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 would be not less than 400% of that for the same period last year. The above information is the preliminary assessment by the Company based on the consolidated management accounts and other information currently available, which have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditors. Shareholders and potential investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the securities of the Company.
    

      This announcement is made by Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited (the "Company", together with its subsidiaries, collectively the "Group") pursuant to the Inside Information Provisions under Part XIVA of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Chapter 571 of the laws of Hong Kong) (the "SFO") and Rule 13.09 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the "Listing Rules").
    

      Based on a preliminary assessment, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") wishes to inform the shareholders of the Company (the "Shareholders") and potential investors that, it is expected that there would be a substantial increase in the Group's consolidated profit for the six months ended 30 June 2017, and that the profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 would be not less than 400% of that for the same period last year.
    

      The Board believes that the increase in profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was mainly attributed to i) improvement of the Group's operational integrated management efficiency; ii) significant increase in gross profit margin of new automobiles as a result of the major brands' prominent performance with more clear advantage of the brand portfolio; and iii) stable growth in income from after-sales services with rapid development of other derivative businesses.
    

      Shareholders and potential investors should note that the information set out in this announcement is based on a preliminary assessment by the Company based on the consolidated management accounts and other information currently available, which have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditors. The Company is still in the process of finalising the Group's consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Details on the financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to be disclosed in the interim results announcement of the Company (which is expected to be announced by the end of August 2017) shall prevail.


      Shareholders and potential investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the securities of the Company.
    

      By Order of the Board
    

      Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited Mr. Wu Tak Lam
    

      Chairman
    

      26 July 2017
    

      As at the date of this announcement, the Board comprises four executive directors, namely, Mr. Wu Tak Lam, Ms. Chiu Man, Mr. Jia Ruobing and Mr. Gou Xinfeng; and three independent non- executive directors, namely, Mr. Liu Jie, Mr. Song Tao and Dr Liu Xiaofeng.
