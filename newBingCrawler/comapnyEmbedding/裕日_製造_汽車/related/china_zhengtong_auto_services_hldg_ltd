Ratios valuation of China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited ( 1728 | CYM)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited is slightly lower than the median of its peer group: around 10.00. According to these financial ratios China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited's valuation is consistent with the market valuation of its peer group.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited is higher than the average of its sector (Specialty Retailers): 8.49. According to these financial ratios China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited's valuation is above the market valuation of its sector.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited is significantly higher than its historical 5-year average: 5.9. The (current) company valuation of China Zhengtong Auto Services Holdings Limited is therefore way above its valuation average over the last five years.Valuation

There are many standard financial ratios used in order to evaluate a business or a company. Financial ratios can also be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Security analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various companies. In Infinancials, financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business that the ratio measures:- Growth ratios measure the company's rate of growth and assess the potential for future growth. E.g. Net Sales Growth, EBITDA Growth, EBIT Growth.- Profitability ratios measure the returns generated on sales and investment, hence the ability of the company to generate profits.Profitability ratios include margin ratios (such as profit margin or operating margin) and return ratios (such as return on equity or return on assets).- Capital structure and liquidity ratios measure the extent to which the company is relying upon debt to fund its operations, and its ability to pay back the debt. Capital structure ratios include debt to equity and debt to asset ratios, and liquidity ratios include coverage ratios and solvency ratios.- Asset utilization ratios, also called activity or efficiency ratios, measure how efficiently the company's day to day operations are managing inventory, selling and producing products, or using assets to generate revenue.Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies, between industries and also between a single company and its industry average or peer group average.
