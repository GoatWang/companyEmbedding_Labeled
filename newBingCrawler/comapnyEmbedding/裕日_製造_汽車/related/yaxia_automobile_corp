Auto finance industry is flourishing in China with market size approximating RMB850 billion in 2015 and expected to rise by 17.6% from a year ago to around RMB1 trillion in 2016. Compared with mature markets like Europe, the United States and Japan that boast penetration rates above 50%, China’s auto finance penetration rate is low, only 35% or so, indicating large room for growth. As those born in the 1980s and 1990s gradually become the key consumers of cars, changes in consumption habits will promote the development of automotive finance industry, boosting auto finance penetration rate in China to an estimated 50% in 2020.
The Chinese automotive finance market now is still dominated by commercial banks and auto finance companies which together seize a more than 80% share. The remaining less than 20% is shared by financial leasing companies, Internet finance companies and other institutions. However, propelled by favorable policies, these small players will see a further rise in their market shares.
By March 2016, there were 25 auto finance companies approved in China with total assets of RMB419 billion. These players lent a total of RMB391.06 billion in 2015, including retail loans of RMB305.15 billion (78%) and dealership loans of RMB84.05 billion (21.5%).
Among these 25 auto finance companies, several large foreign-funded enterprises including SAIC-GMAC, Volkswagen Finance (China), BMW Automotive Finance (China), and Toyota Motor Finance (China) are highly competitive with rich experience and solid financial strength. The four players booked net interest income of RMB3.8661 billion, RMB2.2921 billion, RMB1.9933 billion, and RMB1.7402 billion in 2015, respectively.
Driven by favorable policies, used car finance and Internet auto finance are ushering in opportunities for development.
Used car finance: Over 9.42 million used cars were traded in China in 2015. The ratio of trade volume of used cars to that of new vehicles was only 0.38, a greater gap compared with 1.5 in foreign countries, indicating a huge potential. This attracts not only traditional auto finance-related companies but also Internet giants (like Bitauto, Tencent, JD, and Alibaba) to make their presence in the segment.
The promulgation of the Opinions on Promoting Convenient Transaction of Used Cars not only regulates used car transaction markets but also increases support for used car transaction credit and lowers credit standards, thus fueling the development of used car finance. The Chinese used car finance market will be gradually opened.
Internet auto finance: Auto finance industry in China has moved into an “Internet Plus”era. Thanks to a series of measures put forward in the Guidance on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance to encourage Internet finance platform, product, and service innovation and local governments’ support for Internet finance, China’s “Internet + auto finance” is embracing opportunities.
While traditional auto finance-related companies combine their original auto finance business with Internet, the Internet giants like Alibaba, JD, Bitauto, and Autohome also branch out into auto finance sector.

Product Code: YSJ063Abstract

 In the wake of declined automotive sales, the construction speed of auto
 dealers' 4S stores also slowed down somewhat in China in 2012. In 2012, the
 number of additional 4S stores in China registered 2000-plus, and the total
 number approximated 20,000. Among the listed dealers, Pangda Automobile Trade
 boasts the most 4S stores, with the number hitting 771, far higher than that
 of other peers.


 Due to slowdown of new vehicle sales market and the amounting pressure of
 inventory, the dealers successively rendered price reduction as the main
 promotion means, which caused the drop in profitability of many dealers in
 2012. Meanwhile, the fall of gross margin also indicates that the new vehicle
 sales business has been gradually into the era of meager profit.

 In contrast to the depressed new vehicle sales market, the automotive
 after-sale service and used car sales business presented greater development
 potential.

After-sale market

 At present, the after-sale market has become the main profit origin of auto
 dealers, and its gross margin is much higher than that of new vehicle sales
 business. For instance, the gross margin of Pangda Automobile Trade's new
 vehicle sales business was 7.28% in H1 2012, while that of its after-sale
 market reached as high as 34.26% in the corresponding period; Yongda Auto's
 new vehicle sales business showed a gross margin of 5.24% in H1 2012, while
 that of its after-sale business was high up to 43.58%.


 At present, the revenue from after-sale service of automobile dealers in China
 only accounts for 10% or so of new vehicle sales, and the gross margin is
 roughly 80% of that of new vehicle sales, while the above proportions
 respectively approximate 30% and 320% in the United States. Referring to
 overseas experience, the after-sale service will become the most important
 profit source of auto dealers in China in the future.

Used car market

 The trading volume of used cars in China amounted to 2.658 million units in
 2007, and climbed to 4.817 million units in 2012, with an AAGR of 12.63%. In
 2011 and 2012, the growth rates of used car trade volume in China hit 12.41%
 and 11.24% separately, much higher than that of new vehicle sales market.


 At present, many well-known auto dealers have launched the used car business,
 and in particular, Zhongda Yuantong has traded nearly 30,000 used cars in the
 first nine months of 2012, including 5,354 self-operated used cars, rising
 9.9% year-on-year. Besides, other dealers like Pangda Automobile Trade,
 Sinomach Automobile, Dah Chong Hong, Zhongda Yuantong, Yongda Auto, Lentuo
 Group and Yaxia Auto all possess used car business.


 In July 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China
 issued the Criterion for Appraisal and Evaluation of Used Car (Exposure
 Draft). It is predicted that the Criterion will be officially issued in H1
 2013, and the most crucial evaluation of used car market is expected to be
 regulated, which will positively bolster the disciplined development of used
 car market.

 etc. in China;

 development features, etc.;

DUBLIN, Dec 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "China Automotive Distribution and Aftermarket Report, 2016-2020" report to their offering. 








Given fiercer competition, rising operating costs, huger inventory pressure and other factors, as well as the impact of the emerging e-business mode, the automotive distribution industry is facing an enormous challenge. In 2015, the number of 4S shops in China reduced by 920 year on year, and in the future the number will shrink further, while automotive e-business, automobile supermarkets and other multi-brand automotive business models will grow up. 
Amid the weak development of the automotive distribution industry, the automotive aftermarket, covering automotive finance, auto repair & beauty and used cars, has sprung up with higher profit margins. In 2015, the overall size of Chinese automotive aftermarket reached RMB2,154 billion, of which RMB850 billion and RMB755 billion stemmed from automotive finance and auto repair & beauty respectively. 
In recent years, Chinese car dealers have only garnered the car sales gross margin of less than 5%, with an overall downward trend; whereas, after-sales services enjoy the gross margin of above 40%. 
In the face of lower gross margins, massive inventory and the gradual decline in economic benefits, some dealers have to seek further development through mergers and acquisitions, or expansion of the automotive aftermarket, or the combination of online and offline business, or layout in the field of new energy vehicles. 
M & A: In 2016, China Grand Auto acquired Baoxin Auto Group, Dalian Zunrong Auto Trade Co., Ltd., Peng Feng Group and other car distribution groups to expand sales network and further consolidate its leading position. 
Key Topics Covered: 
1 Overview 2 Overview and Competitive Landscape of Automotive Distribution in China 3 Sales Market of New Vehicle in China 4 Chinese Used Car Sales Market 5 Chinese Automotive Finance Market 6 Chinese Auto Repair & Beauty Market 7 Chinese Auto Insurance Market 8 Majors Car Dealers in China

Description


Given fiercer competition, rising operating costs, huger inventory pressure and other factors, as well as the impact of the emerging e-business mode, the automotive distribution industry is facing an enormous challenge. In 2015, the number of 4S shops in China reduced by 920 year on year, and in the future the number will shrink further, while automotive e-business, automobile supermarkets and other multi-brand automotive business models will grow up.


Amid the weak development of the automotive distribution industry, the automotive aftermarket, covering automotive finance, auto repair & beauty and used cars, has sprung up with higher profit margins. In 2015, the overall size of Chinese automotive aftermarket reached RMB2,154 billion, of which RMB850 billion and RMB755 billion stemmed from automotive finance and auto repair & beauty respectively.


In recent years, Chinese car dealers have only garnered the car sales gross margin of less than 5%, with an overall downward trend; whereas, after-sales services enjoy the gross margin of above 40%.





In the face of lower gross margins, massive inventory and the gradual decline in economic benefits, some dealers have to seek further development through mergers and acquisitions, or expansion of the automotive aftermarket, or the combination of online and offline business, or layout in the field of new energy vehicles.





M & A : In 2016, China Grand Auto acquired Baoxin Auto Group, Dalian Zunrong Auto Trade Co., Ltd., Peng Feng Group and other car distribution groups to expand sales network and further consolidate its leading position.


Automotive Aftermarket Layout : In 2015, Sinomach Automobile and Federal-Mogul co-founded Federal-Mogul CAIEC Automotive Technology Services (Beijing) Co., Ltd. to establish a car repair & maintenance-based business network in the automotive aftermarket and an online + offline standardized ecosystem centering on "products + services", as well as provide comprehensive maintenance solutions for medium and high-end brand car customers.


Internet + Layout : In 2015, China Grand Auto cooperated with Alibaba, yiche.com and autohome.com.cn to set up an O2O platform serving consumers in car selection, loans, insurance, delivery, maintenance, replacement, second-hand car loans, and among others.


New Energy Vehicle Layout : In 2014, PANGDA Automobile Trade Group set up a joint venture - Pangda- BAIC New Energy Vehicle Sales Co, Ltd. with BAIC. In 2015, PANGDA Automobile sold about 14,000 new energy vehicles. In addition, PANGDA Automobile also erected an electric vehicle street and an electric vehicle test drive field in Wufangqiao, Beijing, a new energy vehicle hypermarket in Tianjin, a new energy vehicle leasing & sale experience center in Tangshan city, and a new energy vehicle supermarket in Shenyang city.

Description

Abstract

 In the wake of declined automotive sales, the construction speed of auto
 dealers' 4S stores also slowed down somewhat in China in 2012. In 2012, the
 number of additional 4S stores in China registered 2000-plus, and the total
 number approximated 20,000. Among the listed dealers, Pangda Automobile Trade
 boasts the most 4S stores, with the number hitting 771, far higher than that
 of other peers.


 Due to slowdown of new vehicle sales market and the amounting pressure of
 inventory, the dealers successively rendered price reduction as the main
 promotion means, which caused the drop in profitability of many dealers in
 2012. Meanwhile, the fall of gross margin also indicates that the new vehicle
 sales business has been gradually into the era of meager profit.

 In contrast to the depressed new vehicle sales market, the automotive
 after-sale service and used car sales business presented greater development
 potential.

After-sale market

 At present, the after-sale market has become the main profit origin of auto
 dealers, and its gross margin is much higher than that of new vehicle sales
 business. For instance, the gross margin of Pangda Automobile Trade's new
 vehicle sales business was 7.28% in H1 2012, while that of its after-sale
 market reached as high as 34.26% in the corresponding period; Yongda Auto's
 new vehicle sales business showed a gross margin of 5.24% in H1 2012, while
 that of its after-sale business was high up to 43.58%.


 At present, the revenue from after-sale service of automobile dealers in China
 only accounts for 10% or so of new vehicle sales, and the gross margin is
 roughly 80% of that of new vehicle sales, while the above proportions
 respectively approximate 30% and 320% in the United States. Referring to
 overseas experience, the after-sale service will become the most important
 profit source of auto dealers in China in the future.

Used car market

 The trading volume of used cars in China amounted to 2.658 million units in
 2007, and climbed to 4.817 million units in 2012, with an AAGR of 12.63%. In
 2011 and 2012, the growth rates of used car trade volume in China hit 12.41%
 and 11.24% separately, much higher than that of new vehicle sales market.


 At present, many well-known auto dealers have launched the used car business,
 and in particular, Zhongda Yuantong has traded nearly 30,000 used cars in the
 first nine months of 2012, including 5,354 self-operated used cars, rising
 9.9% year-on-year. Besides, other dealers like Pangda Automobile Trade,
 Sinomach Automobile, Dah Chong Hong, Zhongda Yuantong, Yongda Auto, Lentuo
 Group and Yaxia Auto all possess used car business.


 In July 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China
 issued the Criterion for Appraisal and Evaluation of Used Car (Exposure
 Draft). It is predicted that the Criterion will be officially issued in H1
 2013, and the most crucial evaluation of used car market is expected to be
 regulated, which will positively bolster the disciplined development of used
 car market.

		Given fiercer competition, rising operating costs, huger inventory pressure and other factors, as well as the impact of the emerging e-business mode, the automotive distribution industry is facing an enormous challenge. In 2015, the number of 4S shops in China reduced by 920 year on year, and in the future the number will shrink further, while automotive e-business, automobile supermarkets and other multi-brand automotive business models will grow up.Amid the weak development of the automotive distribution industry, the automotive aftermarket, covering automotive finance, auto repair & beauty and used cars, has sprung up with higher profit margins. In 2015, the overall size of Chinese automotive aftermarket reached RMB2,154 billion, of which RMB850 billion and RMB755 billion stemmed from automotive finance and auto repair & beauty respectively.In recent years, Chinese car dealers have only garnered the car sales gross margin of less than 5%, with an overall downward trend; whereas, after-sales services enjoy the gross margin of above 40%.In the face of lower gross margins, massive inventory and the gradual decline in economic benefits, some dealers have to seek further development through mergers and acquisitions, or expansion of the automotive aftermarket, or the combination of online and offline business, or layout in the field of new energy vehicles.M & A: In 2016, China Grand Auto acquired Baoxin Auto Group, Dalian Zunrong Auto Trade Co., Ltd., Peng Feng Group and other car distribution groups to expand sales network and further consolidate its leading position.Automotive Aftermarket Layout: In 2015, Sinomach Automobile and Federal-Mogul co-founded Federal-Mogul CAIEC Automotive Technology Services (Beijing) Co., Ltd. to establish a car repair & maintenance-based business network in the automotive aftermarket and an online + offline standardized ecosystem centering on "products + services", as well as provide comprehensive maintenance solutions for medium and high-end brand car customers.Internet + Layout: In 2015, China Grand Auto cooperated with Alibaba, yiche.com and autohome.com.cn to set up an O2O platform serving consumers in car selection, loans, insurance, delivery, maintenance, replacement, second-hand car loans, and among others.New Energy Vehicle Layout: In 2014, PANGDA Automobile Trade Group set up a joint venture – Pangda- BAIC New Energy Vehicle Sales Co, Ltd. with BAIC. In 2015, PANGDA Automobile sold about 14,000 new energy vehicles. In addition, PANGDA Automobile also erected an electric vehicle street and an electric vehicle test drive field in Wufangqiao, Beijing, a new energy vehicle hypermarket in Tianjin, a new energy vehicle leasing & sale experience center in Tangshan city, and a new energy vehicle supermarket in Shenyang city.China Automotive Distribution and Aftermarket Report, 2016-2020 involves the following:Overview and competitive landscape of automotive distribution (including status quo, distribution mode, profit model, competitive landscape and development tendency) in China;Sales market of new vehicle in China (including overall market, passenger cars, commercial vehicles, new energy vehicles, development trends, etc.);Analysis on used car sales market, auto finance market, auto repair & beauty market and auto insurance market in China;Operation, layout, sale, development, etc. of 12 car dealers.

                                                                                    In the wake of declined automotive sales, the construction speed of auto dealers’ 4S stores also slowed down somewhat in China in 2012. In 2012, the number of additional 4S stores in China registered 2000-plus, and the total number approximated 20,000. Among the listed dealers, Pangda Automobile Trade boasts the most 4S stores, with the number hitting 771, far higher than that of other peers. Due to slowdown of new vehicle sales market and the amounting pressure of inventory, the dealers successively rendered price reduction as the main promotion means, which caused the drop in profitability of many dealers in 2012. Meanwhile, the fall of gross margin also indicates that the new vehicle sales business has been gradually into the era of meager profit. In contrast to the depressed new vehicle sales market, the automotive after-sale service and used car sales business presented greater development potential. After-sale marketAt present, the after-sale market has become the main profit origin of auto dealers, and its gross margin is much higher than that of new vehicle sales business. For instance, the gross margin of Pangda Automobile Trade’s new vehicle sales business was 7.28% in H1 2012, while that of its after-sale market reached as high as 34.26% in the corresponding period; Yongda Auto’s new vehicle sales business showed a gross margin of 5.24% in H1 2012, while that of its after-sale business was high up to 43.58%. At present, the revenue from after-sale service of automobile dealers in China only accounts for 10% or so of new vehicle sales, and the gross margin is roughly 80% of that of new vehicle sales, while the above proportions respectively approximate 30% and 320% in the United States. Referring to overseas experience, the after-sale service will become the most important profit source of auto dealers in China in the future. Used car marketThe trading volume of used cars in China amounted to 2.658 million units in 2007, and climbed to 4.817 million units in 2012, with an AAGR of 12.63%. In 2011 and 2012, the growth rates of used car trade volume in China hit 12.41% and 11.24% separately, much higher than that of new vehicle sales market. At present, many well-known auto dealers have launched the used car business, and in particular, Zhongda Yuantong has traded nearly 30,000 used cars in the first nine months of 2012, including 5,354 self-operated used cars, rising 9.9% year-on-year. Besides, other dealers like Pangda Automobile Trade, Sinomach Automobile, Dah Chong Hong, Zhongda Yuantong, Yongda Auto, Lentuo Group and Yaxia Auto all possess used car business. In July 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China issued the Criterion for Appraisal and Evaluation of Used Car (Exposure Draft). It is predicted that the Criterion will be officially issued in H1 2013, and the most crucial evaluation of used car market is expected to be regulated, which will positively bolster the disciplined development of used car market. KEY TOPICS COVERED- Automobile distribution models, development features of various models, etc. in China;- Progression of auto dealers in China, like quantity, profitability and development features, etc.;- Development of various automobile distribution businesses in China, including the distribution modes, characteristics and development prospects of diversified businesses such as new vehicle, used car, vehicle maintenance, automotive financing and insurance;- Operation, profitability, business development, 4S distribution network and expansion, etc. of 12 listed automobile dealers in China.
