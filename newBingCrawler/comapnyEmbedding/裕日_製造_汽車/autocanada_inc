AutoCanada Inc. Provides Update on Acquisition Pipeline

Tuesday, Apr 29, 2014





EDMONTON, April 29, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - AutoCanada Inc. ("AutoCanada" or the
"Company") (TSX: ACQ) announced today that it has signed a purchase
agreement for a dealer group, as well as purchase agreements for
additional unrelated dealerships outside of the dealer group.  In
total, the Company has executed purchase agreements for eight
dealerships, which we would expect to close at various times within the
next 90 days.  All such agreements are in different stages of progress
with respect to due diligence, and all are subject to Manufacturer
approval which is anticipated, but is not assured.


With respect to such dealerships, the estimated aggregate results in
2013 were as follows:



Total revenues of $422 million


Total new vehicles retailed of 5,936


Total used vehicles retailed of 3,538


Total service bays of 126




The purchase multiples are consistent with recent acquisition activity. 
AutoCanada has a number of financing alternatives available and
anticipates financing these acquisitions through either debt or the
issuance of equity or a combination thereof. 


Commenting upon this development, Pat Priestner, Chairman and CEO of
AutoCanada stated that, "The Company is excited by the opportunity to
add additional dealerships to the AutoCanada family, and we are working
diligently with the various Manufacturers to obtain their approval,
which we would anticipate over the coming four to six weeks.  In
addition to these eight dealerships, we continue to pursue additional
opportunities which are in various stages of progress."


About AutoCanada

dealership groups, currently operating 34 franchised dealerships in

Cadillac, Infiniti, Nissan, Hyundai, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Audi, and
Volkswagen branded vehicles. In 2013, our dealerships sold

MARKETS SERVED BY AUTOCANADA
					 

This section provides readers 
				with commercial intelligence on the markets in Canada, 
				and the Cities and Towns in the country. This section gives both a narrative description (about 
				2215 pages) of the various matters 
				covered as well as provides readers with the ability to directly 
				use the Chapters (via Microsoft Word or compatible word 
				processors) to produce their own reports and documentation. 
				 Experienced users will be able to use the spreadsheet and 
				databases to generate highly detailed narrative reports, charts 
				and graphics - as well as sophisticated business and commercial 
				forecasts and models. The databases are provided in both Excel 
				spreadsheets (about 3660 spreadsheets) and an Access database 
				tables (about 3810 tables). Explanatory notes are provided as word processor
    documents or in PDF formats.  
 



The narrative
    is necessarily illustrative in its terminology and seeks to provide a basic
    degree of business logic and theory which indicates the rational applied in
    the forecasting and modelling methodology.


 



The databases provided are specifically
    designed to provide users with a uniform and consistent numeric measure of
    both (normally) quantifiable values as well as conceptual factors which are
    (usually) only capable of qualification. Experienced users will know how to
    apply forecasting and modelling software to the numeric data provided to
    generate highly detailed and discrete business planning models. The
    databases provided in this report can be used directly with databases on
    other product, markets and industries in other countries. The databases are
    specifically designed to be trans-national, currency neutral, inflation and
    purchasing parity adjusted, product parity and product equivalent adjusted,
    opportunity cost adjusted, and numerically compatible; they all can be
    linked or merged programmatically in business planning models to provide
    multi-national and multi-level analysis.





Before using the data provided please
    read the Database
    Introduction as well as the Notes and Definitions links found in
    each Chapter. There are subtle statistical nuances to some of the
    spreadsheets and databases which will help the user to fine-tune their
    models and forecasts to obtain maximum effect and greater accuracy. The
    database flow chart and database description should be consulted when
    applying statistical and modelling software.
