Superior customer service! Very happy buyer!A.j. Bibergall · 2016年5月11日Bought a car from autosport batavia today and I can't be happier. Car came clean, fully detailed. Every car on that lot looked like it was worth buying. If you'⋯⋯re looking for a used car at an amazing price from a dealership you can trust, I highly recommend stopping by and checking out Autosport Batavia  Edit: Not only do they sell great cars, but the service is phenomenal as well. About a month after owning the car, I had them put in a new clutch assembly as well as an aftermarket ims bearing. This is an incredibly difficult job that most people recommend only having Porsche do, but I trust autosport and they did an amazing job for an even better price. The car feels like brand new now and I couldn't be happier. Definitely a long term customer right here. 更多Abbie Tazelaar · 2015年11月4日Close to work, friendly staff..super easy going no need to drive to the jeep dealer.Edward Rothschild · 2015年11月15日Friend bought a vehicle from them, supposedly in excellent condition and it was not.

Autosports Group

Question
Hi, do you know when the Autosports Group is being offered for an IPO? Also, where do I access upcoming floats within your site? Thanks.


Answer
Hi,
According to the ASX website, it appears that Autosport's IPO is due to close on November 14. You can find more information about it here. I have been unable to find a copy of the prospectus at this time following a brief search which means I am unable to provide any extra information. 
As for where on our site you can find information on 'upcoming IPO's', unfortunately, there isn't a page. The ASX does provide this information on their website (here's the link).
Regards
Andrew
