Company Introduction
FUJIAN JIATIAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT CO.,TD is the largest fungus and king oyster mushroom factory which registers capital of USD 2.2 million . We have ZHANGZHOU JIATIAN IMPORT AND EXPORT CO.,LTD. 
 We are reformed from Nanjing Jiatian Edible Fungus Development Co., Ltd founded in 1983.

Our company is the Key Leading Enterprise of Agricultural Industrialization in Fujian Province and now owns three production bases, an excellent mushroom spawn implantation centre and one import & export company. Our company is an integrated body of scientific research cultivation, preservation, processing and sale.

We can produce 10 million bags of white ba1ff8ck fungus, mini oyster mushroom, tricholoma giganteum massee, maximum clitocybe and other rarely edible fungus. So we are a leading enterprise in the field. Meanwhile, we have succeeded to contract with more than five thousand farmer households to plant 200 million bags of edible fungus each year and create value of USD 30 million.

Our company always honors the principle of "seeking fact, innovation, credibility and progress", and insists on "progress by science, famous brand by quality, benefits by management" in order to expand the scale of company and improve economic benefits.

Under the attention and help of related departments, our "Jiatian" series edible fungus products have gained the awards of the first reward of "Fujian special product exhibition at Kunming international exhibition in 1999", "the Famous Product of China International Agricultural Exhibition in 1999", "the Most Famous Primary Products of Zhangzhou in 1999", "the First Award of the 2ND Flower Exposition of Mainland and Taiwan Strait, Zhangzhou, Fujian in 2000", and "the famous product of Fujian in 2002".

Our company gained the awards of "the Key Leading Enterprise of Agricultural Industrialization in Fujian Province" in 2004. Now six kinds of edible fungus have been certified as AA grade "Green Food" &"Organic Food" and so we become one of enterprises with many green food certificates. Moreover, our white back black fungus gained the American "FDA" approval in 1998.

At the same time, our company has also been awarded at The Tenth Anniversary of the Implementation of Spark Program by the State Science and Technology. 

Our company also has been required by our Ministry of Agriculture to formulated the White Back Black Fungus Product Standards, undertaken the implementation of "scientific research and promotion of Rare Edible Fungus" by Zhangzhou Science and Technology Commission and has become an important agricultural cooperation base for Taiwan.

After many years development, our company realized the only way to strengthen enterprise is developing deep processing, building sales channels and brand building.

Our company developed preserved fresh mushroom, dried mushroom, flexible packaging products, mushroom seasoning, mushroom leisure food, and other related products. We also further develop the edible fungus beverages and extract and other value-added products. We also help farmers to get rich in response to the government calling.

Our company always adheres to the principle of "people first, technology innovation, safe producing, and standard management" and the spirit of "scientific innovation, credibility and mutual benefits". Meanwhile, we would like to cooperate with all friends in the world for healthy prosperity and better future.
