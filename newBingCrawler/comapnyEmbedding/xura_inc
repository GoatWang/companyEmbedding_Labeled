Mavenir is a technology company headquartered in Richardson, Texas, in the United States, that offers a portfolio of digital services that enable global communications across a variety of mobile devices and platforms. It markets and sells to communications service providers (CSPs) and to enterprises. By their own description they work in the realm of "network transformation for service providers by offering a comprehensive product portfolio across every layer of the network infrastructure stack".
Mavenir has a complicated corporate history. One part of it consists of pieces of Comverse, Inc. (which derived from the well-known Comverse Technology) and Acision; this combination formed an entity called Xura between 2015 and 2017. Another part of it comes from a start-up company called Ranzure. And another part comes from an earlier company called Mavenir Systems, which went into and out of Mitel Networks Corporation before becoming part of, and serving as the revived name for, Mavenir.

History[edit]
Part of Comverse Technology[edit]
Main article: Comverse Technology
As a subsidiary, Comverse, Inc. was incorporated on November 19, 1997,[1] as part of the larger Comverse Technology.
In August 2012, a series of transactions were announced that would end Comverse Technology as a functioning entity, by making Comverse Network Systems an independent company once again known simply as Comverse, allowing Verint Systems (the former Comverse Infosys) to buy back Comverse Technology's majority stake in it, and selling off other subsidiaries.[2][3] Philippe Tartavull was named as the CEO of the independent Comverse, and continues to be President and CO of Xura, Inc.
These transactions were completed by February 4, 2013, and represented the effective liquidation of the Comverse Technology holding entity[3][4] and the emergence of Comverse, Inc. as a fully independent company.

Results for fiscal year 2011, which took place as the spin-off of Comverse from Comverse Technology was happening, demonstrated a return to profitability, with a net income of $5.1 million.[5] Its stock symbol was CNSI and it was traded on the NASDAQ exchange.
In March 2015 Comverse had 3,000 employees, of whom 750 were located in Israel. Company headquarters was in Wakefield, Massachusetts in the United States.
Comverse's products and solutions included Traditional VAS (TVAS) - Digital Services from the Cloud (mVas), Unified Communications - Cloud Business VoIP & UC, and the Evolved Communication Suite.
During June 2015 Comverse divested its BSS business to Amdocs. In August 2015 Comverse announced it had completed the previously-announced acquisition[6] of Acision, a privately held firm that specialized in secure mobile messaging and engagement services.
Xura[edit]

Following Comverse Inc.'s acquisition of Acision on 6 August 2015, Xura, Inc. was launched on 9 September 2015, as the new brand of the combined entity.[7][8][9][10] The name 'Xura' was adapted from the word 'Aura'.[8]
Philippe Tartavull continued as President and CEO of Xura. The company's core products focus was in Digital Communications Services and Converged Communications (traditional and IP). The Xura stock symbol was MESG and it was listed on the NASDAQ exchange.
The goal of Xura was to assist customers to navigate and monetize the digital ecosystem through cloud-based offerings. Its solutions found use in over 350 service providers and enterprises across over 100 countries.
On May 23, 2016,[11] Xura announced an agreement to be acquired by affiliates of Siris Capital Group for $25.00 per share in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $643 million. This transaction was closed on August 19, 2016, when the acquisition completed taking Xura, Inc. from public to privately backed by affiliates of Siris Capital Group, LLC.
The transaction saw Hubert de Pesquidoux, a Siris Capital Executive Partner, take the role as Xura’s new Executive Chairman.
The New Mavenir[edit]
On December 19, 2016, affiliates of Xura entered into agreements to acquire Mitel Mobility, a division of Mitel Networks Corporation for $385 million, and Ranzure Networks, Inc., an early-stage venture focused on developing 5G cloud-based radio access network technology, for an undisclosed sum.[12][13] Xura also announced that upon completion of the transactions the new combined company name would be Mavenir Systems, Inc., often just known as Mavenir.
Part of the motivation for this series of corporate moves was that the acquisition of original Mavenir had not gone well for Mitel.[13]

WAKEFIELD, Massachusetts, September 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
Bigger, Stronger, Further: Xura creates pathways to next-generation digital technology for CSPs and Enterprises, unlocking limitless communications 
New Report from Industry Analyst Firm Ovum Underscores
Customer Needs in Evolving Digital Communications Marketplace   
 
Comverse, Inc. and Acision is today officially introducing Xura, Inc. to the mobile and digital communications world - a new global company, brand name and ticker symbol (NASDAQ:   MESG). The new identity reflects the joint company's mission to be the trusted next-generation digital technology provider to operators and enterprises across the globe, offering limitless communication solutions that generate new monetization and engagement opportunities with today's multi-device, multi-service consumer.  Already, Xura counts as customers eight of the top 10 global operators, reaching over three billion end points. The company's new website is http://www.xura.com.   Xura will also be renaming all Comverse and Acision subsidiaries.
"Our new brand identity reflects the modern and unique outlook the combined Comverse and Acision companies have for the future of digital communications, enabling us to think bigger, reach further and act smarter. We wanted a name that echoed our no boundaries, anything is possible mindset, and Xura provided this through adaptation of the word "Aura," which imparts a sense of powerful, positive feeling all around you, and connotes the freedom to map thoughts and expression, which is what we want to drive with our digital communication services," said Philippe Tartavull, Chief Executive Officer of Xura, Inc.  
"In today's quickly-shifting world of communications, we will harness our new brand to offer clever ways for operators and enterprises to quickly realize opportunities from existing technology while building richer communication futures. Xura's values, positioning and no boundaries attitude will guide our strategic direction and set us apart in the market environment in which we operate," continued Tartavull.  "We will be agile in delivering new technologies and solutions that differentiate us from other providers. And with a shared set of goals with our customers, the new Xura team will use its insight, knowledge, and thinking to create paths that help them successfully navigate and effectively monetize this next generation of digital communication services and gain competitive advantage."
Xura's Market Perspective 
Worldwide, Communication Service Providers (CSP) are evolving from managing messaging infrastructure systems to reasserting their leadership with advanced digital communications services across IP and NFV.  These communications services are reshaping businesses and opening lucrative new multi-million dollar revenue streams for operators worldwide.
Similarly, enterprises are aggressively engaging their own customers in new ways through mobile and digital services.   Almost every smartphone user today has mobile banking, travel and other "enterprise-class" apps on their phone.  While these apps are designed around the service they offer, very few seamlessly integrate multi-channel communications to enhance the customer experience.  
With leadership across messaging and voicemail services, Xura helps operators and enterprises across the globe address the ever-changing market and meet a full spectrum of communications needs both efficiently and profitably. With three business lines --Digital Communications, Monetization and Enterprise -- Xura's portfolio includes its flagship IP messaging solutions, as well as:


Cloud Advanced-VAS (SMS, MMS, Visual Voicemail, Messaging Gateways)


IP Messaging and RCS (Rich Communication Suite) services


Multi-device Mobile Monetization Services


Security Solutions, such as Spam & Fraud Prevention and Control


Multi-Content Store and Data Analytics


Secure Enterprise Application-to-person (A2P) Messaging


Two-factor Authentication (2FA)


Richer, Real-time Communication Solutions, through rapidly emerging standards such as WebRTC




 
New Ovum Report Underscores Xura's Market Vision 
Underscoring Xura's market vision, industry analyst firm Ovum today issued a new report that evaluates the changing face of consumer communications and the opportunities this presents for operators and enterprises. The research finds that there is an imperative for both the telco and enterprise to evolve their communications platforms.
Commenting on the evolution of communications platform providers, Pamela Clark-Dickson, Principal Analyst in Ovum's Consumer Services Practice, said, "What has emerged is a new breed of vendor: the digital communications service provider which, while competing on some level with a new set of rival companies, is probably most in tune with its telco and enterprise customers across the gamut of digital communications services."
The report advises that special emphasis is given by the telco and enterprise to:


Moving from silos to multi-purpose modular platforms


Transitioning their platforms to support IP-based communications


Acquiring or developing technologies such as RCS and WebRTC


Introducing new delivery models such as network functions virtualization (NFV) and cloud


Targeting new markets such as enterprise messaging; and revising their business models

I am very excited to welcome the Xura Secure Communications team in Munich to the CLX family."Xura Secure Communications is one of Germany's leading mobile messaging and secure communications companies, processing more than 500 million messages annually on behalf of market-leading customers in industries such as aviation and banking.  Offering some of the highest security standards in Germany, Xura Secure Communications is listed as a preferred mobile transaction authentication number (mTAN) provider for Germany's largest banking networks.  With this acquisition, CLX takes a leading position as one of the most innovative cloud communications companies in the world, and at the same time significantly strengthens its presence in Germany and adds to its blue-chip customer base.

This transaction, combined with our previously announced acquisitions of Mitel Mobile and Ranzure Networks, advances the transformation of Xura Inc. into a 100 percent carrier-focused solutions provider with a 'future proof' 5G-ready software portfolio. We can now enhance our focus on our core CSP customers, while CLX, with the acquisition of Xura Secure Communications, will ensure continuity and quality of service for  Xura Secure Communications enterprise customers, who have come to rely on Xura for their secure messaging needs."About CLX Communications CLX Communications AB (Publ) connects enterprises to people and things.
