 In January 2006, the general manager of sales at Castrol India Limited was concerned. Sales of Castrol motorcycle oil for four-stroke engines was far less than it should be, especially when considering the five million motorcycles being added to Indian roads each year. Most motorcycle oil changes took place in franchised workshops during the warranty period and in non-franchised workshops after the warranty period. The general manager wanted to increase the sales of Castrol oil in the spare parts shops and non-franchised workshops that serviced India's growing after-market. Castrol India's existing distributors were reluctant to sell to those segments, which they viewed as low-volume, high-cost, and risky distribution channels. The general manager needed a distribution strategy that would appeal to the existing distributors and boost Castrol Oil India's sales without increasing costs to the company.

About The CompanyCastrol was founded by Charles “Cheers” Wakefield under the name of ‘CC Wakefield & Company’. In 1899, when he was 39, Charles left a job at Vacuum Oil to start a new business at Cheapside in London, selling lubricants for trains and heavy machinery. He was a persuasive man who could articulate a vision, clearly, and eight former colleagues followed him into the new company. Early in the new century, Wakefield took a personal interest in two sporty new motorised contraptions – the automobile and the aeroplane. The company started developing lubricants especially for these new engines, which needed oils that were runny enough to work from cold at start-up and thick enough to keep working at very high temperatures. Wakefield researchers found that adding a measure of castor oil, a vegetable oil made from castor beans, did the trick nicely. They called the new product “Castrol.”Having helped pioneer a new kind of motor oil, now CC Wakefield pioneered a new method of getting customers to notice the product: sponsorship. The Castrol name appeared on banners and flags at competitive aviation events, auto races and at competitive drivers’ attempts to break the land speed record. Wakefield extended the company’s increasingly profitable product line to include oils developed especially for car manufacturer’s individual engines. By 1960, the name of the motor oil had all but eclipsed that of the company’s larger-than-life founder, and so ‘CC Wakefield& Company’ became, simply, Castrol Ltd. Meanwhile, the company’s researchers delved ever deeper into the complexities of engine lubrication and a state-of-the-art research facility opened in Bracknell, England. Then in 1966, The Burmah Oil Company bought Castrol. Proving that Castrol hadn’t become focused solely on cars and aircrafts, the Queen Elizabeth II, the world’s largest ocean-going passenger liner launched in 1967, powered by Castrol lubricants. Through the 1980 and 1990s the company continued to introduce innovative, new products. Burmah-Castrol was purchased by BP in 2000 and the Castrol brand became part of the BP's Group of Companies.More recently, when NASA's Curiosity rover began its exciting mission on Mars in 2012, a Castrol industrial grease played a central role in the smooth operation of everything from Curiosity's wheels to its cameras. The grease is formulated for the space program to perform in temperatures ranging from minus 80 degrees Celsius to 204 degrees Celsius. The success of the company owes much to the original philosophy of Charles Wakefield. He drew on the help and encouragement of his customers in developing his new Castrol Oils, because he had the foresight to see that working in partnership was the best way to achieve success for both parties. This rationale is as relevant to Castrol today as it was then.Castrol, it’s more than just oil, it’s liquid engineering.

Both compliance and being a progressive operator lie in what we call our sphere of control and we call this ‘responsible operations’. It is here that we control the choices made and we are accountable for the outcomes. It is also through this that we are able to generate considerable benefits for society – taxes, salaries, dividends, capability development and a range of essential products.At a further level, being responsible prompts us to play our part in helping to solve challenges that are directly relevant to our long-term business strategy. In line with our business strategy and growth, we recognise the need and importance to make a focused and inclusive contribution towards development, both social and economic.Castrol has a presence in India for over a hundred years. Over the years, the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme has evolved from charitable giving to a strategic CSR programme which seeks to support the communities it operates in and its key stakeholders. Going forward, the company aims to build on this as we develop a CSR programme that aligns business risks and opportunities with the national agenda of development priorities to meet the needs and aspirations of the populace. The various programmes undertaken to date include:Training for two-wheeler mechanics (Eklavya – the flagship programme)Relief and rehabilitation of communities affected by natural disastersCommunity developmentRoad safety (Drive for Safety)

Abstract:

 In January 2006, the general manager of sales at Castrol India Limited was concerned. Sales of Castrol motorcycle oil for four-stroke engines was far less than it should be, especially when considering the five million motorcycles being added to Indian roads each year. Most motorcycle oil changes took place in franchised workshops during the warranty period and in non-franchised workshops after the warranty period. The general manager wanted to increase the sales of Castrol oil in the spare parts shops and non-franchised workshops that serviced India's growing after-market. Castrol India's existing distributors were reluctant to sell to those segments, which they viewed as low-volume, high-cost, and risky distribution channels. The general manager needed a distribution strategy that would appeal to the existing distributors and boost Castrol Oil India's sales without increasing costs to the company.
