	Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA operates within the Petroleum refining sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA with three other
	petroleum refiners in Europe:
		
	MOL Magyar Olaj es Gazipari Nyilvanosan Mukodo Reszvenytarsasag
	
		of Hungary
		(2016
	sales of 3.55 trillion Hungarian Forints [US$13.68  billion]
		of which 93%
		was Downstream),
	
	Galp Energia SGPS, S.A.
	
		of Portugal
		(13.24 billion Euro [US$15.54  billion]
		of which 79%
		was Refining & Distribution of Petroleum Pro), and
	
	Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS
	
		which is
		
		based in Turkey
		(34.85 billion Turkish Liras [US$9.85  billion]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA were 11.15 billion Euro (US$13.08 billion).
	
		This
		
			is
		
			a
			
			decrease of 10.0%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 12.39 billion Euro.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 25.4% decline
		in Semi-Finished Products, from 1.37 billion Euro to 1.02 billion Euro.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Distillers (down 10.0% to 4.29 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Automobile (down 15.0% to 1.58 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Lubricants and Specialities (down 13.1% to 832.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Aviation (down 20.5% to 486.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Heavy Fuels (down 13.9% to 230.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Services (down 9.4% to 222.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Lpg (down 11.9% to 118.00 million Euro)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Interial Tax/petrol Products (up 5.4% to 2.06 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Brut (up 37.4% to 301.00 million Euro)
