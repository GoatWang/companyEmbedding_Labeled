What is affiliate marketing?
Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a retailer rewards one or more publishers (referred to as “affiliates”) for each visitor or customer brought by the publisher’s own marketing efforts. The publisher is usually rewarded for a pre-defined action, such as a sale, a newsletter registration, a download or a click. Essentially, publishers act as an outsourced sales team for the advertiser, promoting their products and getting rewarded, most often, on a percentage of the basket value.

What’s in it for me?
There are many reasons to use the affiliate model, in favour of other monetisation routes:
Rewards
The payout to publishers is usually higher than you can get via other metrics. A cost-per-acquisition (CPA) model, where the advertiser pays out a percentage of the basket value, can deliver significant rewards to publishers and also reward them based on what is sold.
Transparency
Via tracking platforms, such as affiliate networks, publishers are able to see a range of metrics including what was bought from individual retailers, providing an unrivalled level of transparency.
Additional Revenue
Affiliate marketing is a great way to extend and complement your existing revenue streams.
Control
With affiliate marketing you get to choose which advertisers to promote, and control of the message as well as the creative. No other form of digital marketing allows this.
Flexibility
Anyone can promote an affiliate programme via their site, newsletter, app, social profile or other means. You have the flexibility to control the content that appears on your site.
Our client development teams will work with you to ensure that you are in touch with the advertiser programmes that will be the most effective for your website.
