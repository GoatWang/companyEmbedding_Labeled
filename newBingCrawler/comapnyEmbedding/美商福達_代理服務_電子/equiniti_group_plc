Equiniti awarded Product of the Year at Pay and Benefits Awards
Mon 18 Mar 2013

            Equiniti, has been awarded ‘Product of the Year’ for its Employer ISA at the recent Pay and Benefits Awards.
        
The UK’s leading provider of share registration services, Equiniti, has been awarded ‘Product of the Year’ for its Employer ISA at the recent Pay and Benefits Awards.




The Award ceremony, which took place on Thursday 14th March, was attended by some of the most respected business leaders in the industry, and Equiniti fought off stiff competition from Ceridian, Helm Godfrey, Lorica Employee Benefits and Software Europe to win the Award.
For this particular category, the Judges were looking for evidence that the winning product displays creativity and skill in identifying and addressing a need for payroll and benefits professionals.
Equiniti completed the launch of its comprehensive Employer ISA offering in March 2012. The suite of three employer-sponsored product options enables employers to offer valuable additions to their employee benefits, providing employees with easy access, tax efficient savings vehicles.
Benefits of the product include:

Employees can invest tax free up to their annual ISA allowance each tax year (£11,280 for the 2012/2013 tax year) in one ISA
Tailored ISA communication material for employees
Easy access for employees to their ISA (by telephone, internet and intranet)
Single point of contact for all share related queries / questions
Wide investment choice
Regular investment – Employees can buy shares from  £1.75 commission per trade

Mark Taylor, director, Equiniti Investment Services, said: “We wanted to be able to provide employers with increased financial planning opportunities, through which they could encourage their employees to save and make the most of their savings.  With our Employer ISA offering, we can provide a flexible communications plan that can be tailored according to the client’s needs.  At the same time, access to the share portal and our award winning Customer Services team ensures that investors are provided with full support and delivered a smooth and simple account set up.  We are thrilled that our product has been selected as the Product of the Year.”

Equiniti Group plc acquires Nostrum Group

DIGITAL NETWORK Submission, PRESS RELEASE submission7th July 2017 







Equiniti Group plc, the FTSE listed FinTech and regulatory services business, today announces the acquisition of the Nostrum Group Limited (Nostrum).




Nostrum is a fast growing, award winning provider of end-to-end loan management technology that helps banks, finance companies and retail brands provide innovative credit solutions to their customers. They deliver services that support the whole lifecycle of lenders’ operations from front-end lead generation and application processing through to customer servicing.
The acquisition strengthens Equiniti’s position in the lending sector and consolidates the strategy of providing technology enabled loan and mortgage solutions to meet the requirements of this fast-moving market place, building on the technology platforms of Pancredit and the loan, mortgage and insurance servicing permissions of Gateway2Finance.
The lending sector is experiencing unprecedented change as consumers demand greater digital engagement from their finance providers. Equiniti’s capabilities are now united under the Equiniti Credit Services brand which will accelerate product development to meet this growing market opportunity.
Commenting on the acquisition, Guy Wakeley, Chief Executive, said: “We are delighted to announce the acquisition of Nostrum which consolidates Equiniti’s capabilities in the loan sector. The integration of Nostrum will provide greater depth, scale and capability in a dynamic growth market, whilst also providing the platform for a range of new products and services.”
“The business is aligned with the Group strategy of providing regulatory-driven, technology-enabled services, and will contribute to organic growth.”
“I am pleased to welcome Richard Carter, Nostrum’s current Chief Executive, as Managing Director of the newly formed Equiniti Credit Services business.”
Commenting on the transaction Richard Carter said: “Our acquisition by Equiniti and the launch of Equiniti Credit Services represents the next chapter in the development of our business. We are bringing together the best of Equiniti’s rich feature set and Nostrum’s agility. Our solutions and shared heritage will allow us to realise our combined strategic ambition.”
