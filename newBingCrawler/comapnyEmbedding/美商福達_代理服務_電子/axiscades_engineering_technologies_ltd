			The logo is a combination of the symbol and the logotype set beside each other.
			The symbol is a creation of three clasped bands of varying dimensions and represents a globe which is encircled by the solution offerings of the unified brand AXISCADES. It also connotes inspired solutions that go far beyond the brief to meet those customer needs. 
			Thus, the symbol becomes the visual representation of the core values of brand AXISCADES.
			The logotype is the result of the CADES (color coded blue) getting merged with the AXIS (color coded black) to form one powerful, consolidated new entity â€“ AXISCADES â€“ an amalgamation of the diverse skillsets and capabilities.
