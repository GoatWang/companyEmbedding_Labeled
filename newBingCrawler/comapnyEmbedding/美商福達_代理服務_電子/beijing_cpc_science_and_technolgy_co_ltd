Inorganic Deodorant 
 It has a superior deodorizing effect on various unpleasant odors in the living environment. It reacts chemically with gases from bad odors. Therefore, it has a superior instantaneous deodorizing effect. In addition, it reliably deodorizes bad odors in low concentrations which have been difficult to deodorize using conventional materials. It has a superior deodorizing capacity and persistence.              Characteristics * Deodorizing various gases from bad odors* Superior instantaneous deodorizing effect* Reliably deodorizes odors at low concentrations* Superior persistent deodorizing effect* Superior heat resistanceMain applicationsSince it is a thermally and chemically stable material, it has wide-ranging applications in films, paper, non-woven fabrics, other textiles, molded products, and paints. It is a revolutionary deodorant that meets the needs of the market.

System overview

ZYT billet automatic cut to length system is the pioneering technology of Beijing ZhongYuanTong Science And Technology Co., Ltd. and now it has become the standard technology for continuous casting automatic cut to length system. Non-contact automatic Cut to length system is suitable for a variety of cutting methods of continuous casting machine, a system can distinguish different flow slab 1 to 8, 1 to 2 strand slab. The entire system has less investment, without changing the original installation of production equipment, testing does not affect the production, simple operation, and maintenance-free. The technology extend by our company has been wider used by many steel mills in China and abroad.



Equipment type: ZYT-ZPQG-III

System Principle

Through the erection of the roller next to the camera acquiring the image into the computer through the acceleration of the analog video signal processing module and do A / D converter and a digital signal. When the image acquisition to achieve real-time, multi-channel video input, stereo image sequence analysis, motion picture show that simultaneous multiple camera switching, image processing and video signal synchronization combined effect of the treatment completely real-time transmission to meet the complex technological requirements of the scene. Automatically control the cutting equipment, and issue the command: pre-clamp \ clamp \ cutting and other control signals.



Function features

(1)Suitable for a variety of cutting methods, the outside light had no effect on it

(2)Based on the user's site design to send pre-clamping, cutting, production signals

(3)Management, signal database available online to print the production report, including a variety of data per day in each class of statistical system 

(4) Identification error <2mm

(5)For cutting machine back to the wrong place on fire, the system has a unique solution, and to ensure cutting precision

(6)Each flow can sent the signals of pre-clamp, clamping, cutting, roll up, roll down cut car to back according to the requirements of the user

System parameters

Length control accuracy: 5 ~ 10mm

Length range: 2000mm ~ 18000mm

Display: Single-screen, dual or multi-screen

Number of camera: 1 to 6 units, each 3 m length at least one

Control flow number: Billet 1 to 8 strand, slab 1 and 2 strand

Output signal: relay output, AC220V / DC24V to user PLC

Network communication: RJ45 Ethernet interface standards for communication with the host computer

The role of system composition

Near Camera: near- temperature images obtained and transmitted to the system processor. System processor converts images to digital images, image recognition technology through the dynamic temperature, the computer can accurately image from the complex background images to identify the slab, so that when the slab length to reach the head of line position, the computer to cutting the signal can be issued. 

Signal Generator: used to PLC output signal.

Field Camera installed

Horizontal distance from the camera to the billet: 1 ~ 6 m

The vertical height of Camera to billet: 1 ~ 6 m
