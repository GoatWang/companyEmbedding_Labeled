About Us



TRION is a baseball glove manufacturer established since 1959 and reputed to be the “No. 1 Glove Maker”. Our competitive edge is in our ability to innovate, generate creative ideas and pursue advanced technology.
Our manufacturing operation has expanded to overseas in Philippines and Vietnam making not only baseball gloves but also lacrosse and ice hockey gloves inheriting Japanese spirit of craftsmanship and ingenuity. Our passion for product excellence has allowed us to supply gloves for all levels of play from kid’s sandlot league to the professional players in the Major Leagues in baseball, lacrosse and hockey.
Capitalizing on our accumulated manufacturing know-how, we are expanding our product line to include business and ladies’ bags. We are now developing 2 original brands: “TRION” business and casual bags made mainly from baseball glove leather and “Lapu-Lapu” ladies’ bags made from natural materials of fiber, basket or natural tanned leather.
TRION pursues functionality and design but values simplicity at the same time. As we reach new heights, we will continue to innovate to stay as the “One & Only 1 Bag Maker”.
