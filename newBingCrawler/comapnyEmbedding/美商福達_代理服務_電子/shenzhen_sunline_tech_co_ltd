Company Description                    




                        The company is headquartered in Shenzhen, boasting two technology development centers in China (Shenzhen/Shanghai). It primarily engages in providing IT system solutions (for both internal and external operations) for China’s medium and small commercial banking institutions. The company basically operates by providing IT solutions on the basis of the company’s own self-developed software, covering areas such as consulting, system integration, operation management, and support and training services. The company forms strategic partnerships with its upper stream providers (notably IBM, Oracle, SAP, and EMC), where it enjoys direct ordering privileges with its partners, meanwhile using OEM solutions to meet its needs on software and hardware developing platform, lowing the cost of the entire system. Since its establishment the company has not changed its main operations and business model, and the most recent annual report indicates that its main income comes from sales of its self-development software. Some of the company’s recent clients include Evergrowing Bank, Zunyi City Commercial Bank, Jiangnan Rural Commercial Bank, and Bank of Zhengzhou.
