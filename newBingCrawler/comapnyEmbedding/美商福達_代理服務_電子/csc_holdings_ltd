The 14th meeting of the 14th Board of Directors of China Steel Corporation (CSC) was held on June 15, 2012. Major items of the agenda adopted were:

                1. Addition of waste gas desulfurization system for No.3 sinter plant
                This project will commence in July 2012 and is scheduled for completion in October 2014. After completion, the sulfur oxides emission can be not only lowered to less than the emission standard of 100ppm, but also diminished by 4,325kgs per day, which will improve the environmental quality effectively.
2.Budget increase and completion-date extension for the revamp of No.4 Blast Furnace 1st Campaign
                This revamping project, approved in the board meeting on July 16, 2010 totaling NT$5 billion, commenced in August 8, 2010 and planned to complete in July 31, 2013. Original project will adopt the cooling copper stave to revamp at the middle and bottom of the blast furnace and the cooling cast iron stave at other portion. However, CSC has recently learnt that some overseas blast furnaces with copper staves have encountered malfunctions. Therefore, for stabilizing the production and preventing the potential costs of future maintenance and suspension, the design of the cooling stave will be changed to use the same cooling plates as the current campaign uses. The budget will be increased by NT$373 million, and the completion date will be extended to November 30, 2014.
In addition, the board meeting on February 21, 2012 approved the investment of 10% of shares of MCG Coal Holdings' MDL162 mine via China Steel Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, amounting to AUD50 million, and in addition to the future capital expenditures of construction and development according to the shareholding rate. However, because Peabody, the major shareholder of MDL162, determined to execute its pre-emptive right, the transaction has been failed. Since CSC hasn't paid the sums, the board meeting therefore approved to cancel the transaction.

第十四屆第二次董事會重大決議

Jul.16
2010


中鋼公司於99年7月16日召開董事會，通過重要議案如下：
一、投資高規格非方向性電磁鋼片產線
                中鋼已完成開發0.35mm與0.50mm各品級高規格非方向性電磁鋼片，因其具有低鐵損及高磁通之電磁特性，為典型綠色環保產品，已廣泛應用於高效能馬達及變頻壓縮機馬達領域。為改善設備能力，通過投資高規格非方向性電磁鋼片產線。本產線將設置退火酸洗線、往復式冷軋機及退火塗覆線三條主要生產線，計畫工期預計自99年8月開始，至103年5月完工，為期3年10個月。
二、投資肆號高爐第一爐代更新計畫
                中鋼肆號高爐第一爐代自民國85年11月開爐，運轉迄今已達13年7個月，經評估後，預計至民國101年10月將完成第一爐代之生產任務，爐代壽命可達到15年11個月，屆時必須進行停爐更新工程，更新計畫期間自民國99年8月1日至民國102年7月31日止，為期3年。
三、投資興建條線成品立體倉庫案
                由於市場因素、客戶對品質與交期要求，且傳統條線倉儲作業，成品彼此緊密堆疊，易遭捆綁之鋼帶割傷或遭堆高機牙叉架撞傷。中鋼投資興建條線成品立體倉庫，可透過堆取機自動化入儲及出庫作業，條線成品各捲分離，可完全解決平面堆存造成之擦刮傷問題，不僅可提升產品外觀品質、客戶滿意度及產品形象外，並可滿足產線後勤支援及提升土地利用率。工期自99年08月至102年2月，為期2年7個月。
四、投資興建熱軋半成品嘉興儲區
                中鋼熱軋鋼帶工場因受限土地，儲區不足，造成物流問題、產線停機及延遲交貨。本計畫預計於小港區嘉興街興建2棟倉庫，可儲存7.8萬噸熱軋鋼捲及3.1萬噸扁鋼胚等。工期自民國99年8月至101年2月，為期1年7個月。
五、修訂組織規程增設能源環境事務推動辦公室
                為求永續發展，實踐地球公民責任，致力節能減碳，中鋼公司成立非正式組織之「集團能源環境委員會」，主要功能為中鋼集團能源環保政策及方向擬定、共識之形成及集團公司溝通協調之平台，由董事長擔任主任委員，總經理及執行副總經理擔任副主任委員，各副總經理及相關子公司總經理擔任委員。因應「集團能源環境委員會」運作，設置「能源環境事務推動辦公室」為專責單位，直接隸屬總經理，負責集團企業能源環境政策規劃、相關法規風險評估與相關因應策略之規劃、執行等事項。

History[edit]
CSC was founded in April 1959 in Los Angeles, California, by Roy Nutt and Fletcher Jones.[4] CSC initially provided programming tools such as compiler and assembling software.[5]
In the 1960s, CSC provided software writing services to major computer manufacturers like IBM and Honeywell and secured their first contracts for the U.S. public sector with NASA (among others).[5]
By 1963, CSC became the largest software company in the United States and the first software company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[6] By the end of 1968, CSC was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and had operations in Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and the Netherlands.
In the 1970s and 1980s, CSC expanded globally winning large contracts for the finance and defense industries and through acquisitions in Europe and Australia.
Since its beginnings in 1959, company headquarters had been in California. On March 29, 2008, the corporate headquarters of the company were relocated from El Segundo, California, to Annandale, Virginia.[7][8] CSC has been a Fortune 500 Company since 1995,[9] coming in at 162 in the 2012 rankings.[10]
In May 2015, CSC announced plans to split the public sector business from its commercial and international business.[11] In August, it was announced that CSC's Government Service business would merge with SRA International to form a new company -- CSRA—at the end of November 2015.[12]
In July 2015, CSC and HCL Technologies announced the signing of a joint venture agreement to form a banking software and services company, Celeriti FinTech.[13][14]
In September 2015, CSC closed the acquisition of Fixnetix, a provider of front-office managed trading solutions in capital markets.[15] CSC also acquired Fruition Partners, a provider of technology-enabled solutions for the service-management sector during the month.[16]
In November 2015, CSC agreed to acquire the shares of UXC, an IT services company based in Australia in a deal valued at AUD427.6 million (US$309 million).[17]
In December 2015, business technology and services provider, Xchanging, agreed to be purchased by CSC.[18]
In February 2016, CSC announced it was moving its headquarters to Tysons, Fairfax County's central business district, just a few miles from Annandale.[19]
On April 3, 2017, it merged with HP Enterprise Services to create DXC Technology.[2][3]
Business[edit]
CSC ranked among the leading IT service providers in the world.[20][21][22] Geographically, CSC had major operations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
The company operated in three broad service lines or sectors:

North American Public Sector (NPS): Since 1961, CSC has been one of the major IT service providers for the U.S. federal government. CSC provides services to the United States Department of Defense,[23] law enforcement and intelligence agencies (FBI,[24] CIA, Homeland Security[23]), aeronatics and aerospace agencies (NASA). In 2012, U.S. federal contracts accounted for 36% of CSC total revenue.[25]
Managed Services
Business Solutions and Services

The company made several acquisitions, including DynCorp in 2003[26][27] and Covansys Corporation in 2007.[28]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In September 2012, CSC was ranked 8th in Software Magazine’s Software 500 ranking of the world’s largest software and service providers.[29]

Criticism[edit]

In June 2013, Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a Select Committee of the British House of Commons, described CSC as a "rotten company providing a hopeless system" with reference to their multibillion-pound contract to deliver the National Programme for IT Lorenzo contract.[30]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CSC for spending $4.39 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–10, instead getting $305 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $1.67 billion.[31]
In February 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fraud investigation into CSC’s accounting practices in Denmark and Australian business. CSC's CFO Mike Mancuso confirmed that accounting errors and intentional misconduct by certain personnel in Australia prompted SEC regulators to turn their gaze to Australia. Mancuso also stated that the alleged misconduct includes $19 million in both intentional accounting irregularities and unintentional accounting errors.[32]
The company has been accused of breaching human rights by arranging several illegal rendition flights for the CIA between 2003 and 2006, which also has led to criticism of shareholders of the company, including the governments of Norway and Britain.[33][34]
The company has engaged in a number of activities that have resulted in legal action against it. These are:

Its so called WorldBridge Service (Visa Services), which processed and issued millions of visa applications to enter Britain, did not involve British authorities.[35]
CSC was one of the contractors hired by the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its tax-filing system. They told the IRS it would meet a January 2006 deadline, but failed to do so, leaving the IRS with no system capable of detecting fraud. Its failure to meet the delivery deadline for developing an automated refund fraud detection system cost the IRS between $200 million and $300 million.[36]
