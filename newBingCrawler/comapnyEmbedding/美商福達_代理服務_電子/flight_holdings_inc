This is a list of airline holding companies, that either own more than one airline or are the parent company of a single airline.
A company or firm in which the holding company owns a significant portion of voting shares, usually 20–50% or a "minority of share ownership", is known as an associate company. A company in which the holding company owns more than 50% voting shares or a "majority of share ownership" is known as a subsidiary. The holding company thus can also be referred to as the parent company at that stage.
To create the world's largest carrier, American Airlines and US Airways have merged on 9 December 2013, announced on 14 February 2013. The frequent flier programs is expected to be combined at a later date, and the airlines will codeshare in February 2014 using the American flight number. US Airways will exit the Star Alliance on 30 March 2014 and enter Oneworld alliance the day after, a single operating certificate would be delivered at the end of 2015.[1]
