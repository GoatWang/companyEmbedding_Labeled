	China All Access (Holdings) Limited operates within the Computer integrated systems design sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares China All Access (Holdings) Limited with three other
	
			companies in this sector in Hong Kong:
		
	Goldpac Group Limited
	
		(2016
	sales of 1.63 billion Hong Kong Dollars [US$208.17  million]
		of which 84%
		was Embedded software and secure payment pro),
	
	Microware Group Ltd
	
		(1.08 billion Hong Kong Dollars [US$137.71  million]
		), and
	
	Capinfo Company Limited
	
		(1.08 billion Hong Kong Dollars [US$138.86  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		China All Access (Holdings) Limited were HK$3.58 billion (US$458.83 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
				an
			
			increase of 2.3%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were HK$3.50 billion.
	
		Despite this increase, sales are still
		
			well
		
		below the level achieved in 2014, when China All Access (Holdings) Limited
		reported sales of HK$8.85 billion.
	
		Sales of Investment Activities saw an increase
		
			that was more than double the company's growth rate: sales were up
		70.9% in 2016, from
		HK$91.44 million to HK$156.27 million.
