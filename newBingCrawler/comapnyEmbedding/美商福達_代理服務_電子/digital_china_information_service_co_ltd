Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s year-on-year decline in earnings was influenced by a weakening in gross margins from 20.10% to 18.83%, as well as issues with cost controls.  As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 7.79% to 5.22% in this time frame.  For comparison, gross margins were 20.10% and EBITDA margins were 7.79% in the previous period.

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.


000555-CN‘s decline in gross margins were offset by some improvements on the balance sheet.  The management of working capital, for example, shows progress.  The company’s working capital days have fallen to 80.97 days from 99.12 days for the same period last year.  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the gross margin decline is not altogether bad.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
000555-CN‘s year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 446.37% is around its change in earnings.  This suggests that there are likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves for managing earnings this period.

Margins
The company’s decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in operating margins (EBIT margins) from 7.04% to 4.64% and (2) one-time items that contributed to a decrease in pretax margins from 6.78% to 4.02%
