Pe flexible mining duct

1.Material: high denier fire resistant pe fabric

2.Features: flexible, good toughness, anti-static, uv fading. It is able to endure the acid and alkali. Water proof and mold proof. It is of light weight and easy to hang and install, so it will be very convenient during the industrial operation.

We have various specifications of the pe duct for customer's choice, including the negative pressure steel wire flexible duct and positive pressure lay flat flexible duct without steel wire. We also can make different diameters, different angles and t-joint ducts to meet different requires for the mining project.

We have a complete range of specifications for the pe mining duct, each similar diameter of different items can also be connected together. It is of great advantage to reduce the cost and transportation cost if we can use the ducts in a correct way. And it is good for safe handing and storing as well.
