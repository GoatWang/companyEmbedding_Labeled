We give you three simple tips on how to minimise your risk of potential cybercriminals getting to you or your organization:  1) Don’t open shady-looking emails or click hyperlinks from people you don’t know. If you do know the sender, but the message/topic line/link still looks suspicious, get in touch via e.g. a phonecall to clarify if the email/link is legitimate.  2) Protect your financial information to reduce the risk of financial exposure. If you’re using a shared network, identify and isolate your important data from the rest of the network.  3) Be careful with USB drives when sharing documents with others as they can be gateways for malware to your system. Use secure e-mail instead.NNIT A/S · 7月7日 5:54 · We consider digital transformation to be a natural metamorphosis and a necessary part of any healthy customer-centric business.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Oct. 5, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NNIT, a global provider of IT services and consultancy, today announced a worldwide partnership with SAP SE, the market leader in enterprise application software, to market leading solutions supporting regulatory compliance for Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) within the pharmaceutical industry. 

	The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is implementing five new standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Pharmaceutical companies will be required to submit data on medicines to EMA in accordance with common global formats and terminologies. The penultimate goal as defined by the EMA is to improve overall patient safety.

	Committed to support these new regulatory requirements, NNIT will introduce tailored, innovative solutions intended to secure successful IDMP compliance within the authority timelines.

	Rasmus Nelund, Vice President for Life Sciences at NNIT explained:

	"The situation calls for solutions tailored to the global pharmaceutical regulatory environment. While sharing with SAP a strong dedication to life sciences and a documented legacy within the pharmaceutical industry, we look forward to delivering fully integrated services for robust IT throughout the pharmaceutical product life cycle."

	SAP delivers world-class enterprise application software that allows end-to-end process support including master data management and consolidation, text analysis, approval workflow and message exchange support. NNIT provides wall-to-wall IT services including infrastructure, architecture, design, development, implementation, application maintenance, support and hosting.

	Joe Miles, Global Vice President for Life Sciences at SAP, noted:
	  
	"The partnership between NNIT and SAP has existed for more than a decade, delivering business value during implementations for SAP enterprise applications, including the SAP Advanced Track and Trace for Pharmaceuticals application. By collaborating on IDMP, we combine the powerful capabilities of the SAP HANA platform together with NNIT's regulatory expertise and profound legacy within IT services outsourcing for the life sciences industry."

	NNIT delivers international consultancy in IT from early stage development to implementation, validation and operation. Serving a growing number of clients from life sciences, NNIT knows how to create business value while fulfilling the strictest regulatory requirements.
