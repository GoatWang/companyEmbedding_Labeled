Teleena and Cumulocity announce strategic partnership to accelerate IoT adoption

Teleena, a global IoT and MVNO enabler announced a strategic partnership with Cumulocity, the leading IoT device management and application enablement platform provider. With this strategic partnership Teleena will roll-out its IoT Suite with all functionalities for enterprises to build transformational IoT solutions and monetize new business models.
Nieuwegein – January 17 2017 — Teleena’s IoT Suite consists of four modules and is a complete end-2-end service for the IoT ecosystem. It is a configurable one-stop-shop for customers and includes mobile connectivity of all possible wireless technologies like 2G/3G/4G, low power LoRa and public WiFi, connectivity management (IoT Connect), device management (IoT Insight), integration workflow management (IoT Grail) and service billing (IoT Bill). With this partnership, integration to the Teleena IoT connectivity management platform is also available to all Cumulocity customers.
With most global economies now engaged in using IoT to reduce costs, improve revenues and increase customer satisfaction, an increasing number of organisations are finding that something that initially looks easy can turn out to be difficult, complex and costly to develop and maintain. Assembling an IoT solution, it seems, could be one of those things that appears deceptively simple, with recent evidence indicating that it can be a lot harder than it looks.
Cumulocity and Teleena believe that the creation of IoT solutions should be simple and the management of them should be highly automated so organisations can focus on what matters most: their customers.

“With Cumulocity we have integrated a market leading and future proof platform that enables seamless device on boarding, auto-discovery, control and management of IoT devices. Their offering can be readily incorporated into customer’s wider value offerings. Our combined best-of-breed components allows MNOs, OEMs/ODMs and enterprises accelerate their IoT deployments in a manner that is carrier grade for security, availability and reliability”.Timo Smit, Teleena’s founder and Executive Director
“Cumulocity continuously strives to simplify IoT solutions and enable the creative environment where experimentation can be done quickly, cost effectively and robustly. The Teleena IoT Suite provides its IoT customers with a turn-key approach to enable their businesses for the IoT, whether they are the end-customer or reseller. We are also delighted to welcome Teleena into our catalogue of pre-integrated partners.” Bernd Gross, Chief Executive Officer, Cumulocity

Cumulocity joins Intel IoT Solutions Alliance to simplify IoT solution creation and secure deployments

Cumulocity, the leading independent IoT device management and application enablement platform provider, takes a prominent role in Intel’s (NASDAQ: INTC) modular, standards based IoT ecosystem. In addition, Cumulocity increases the number of Intel based IoT devices that can integrate with its IoT platform out-of-the-box.
Dusseldorf, Germany – With many disparate technologies, verticals and organisational maturity levels, Cumulocity believes that the Internet of Things (IoT) requires the collaboration of an ecosystem of partners to best serve an end customer’s unique needs in a way that focuses on benefits and minimises the risks.
Cumulocity has been cooperating on technology with Intel since its formation in 2010, with the two companies now connecting their strong ecosystems to the benefit of all customers and partners. The Intel IoT Solutions Alliance, with its 500+ global member companies provide scalable, interoperable solutions that accelerate the deployment of intelligent devices and end-to-end analytics.

Cumulocity and Libelium Catalyse the Evolution of Smart Cities and Environments

Cumulocity, the leading independent IoT device and application management platform provider, and Libelium, the leading wireless sensor networks solution specialist, combine their IoT platform and sensor network technologies to allow organisations to easily make their city, agriculture and water environments smarter.
Dusseldorf, Germany – The collaboration allows both the connection of sensors monitoring over 120 measurement types, and the integration of analytics triggers with enterprise business systems, to be performed in a ‘plug and play’ manner and eradicates the main complexities of IoT solution development.
Against the background of social, economic and technological changes caused by globalization and the integration process, cities around the world face the challenge of combining competitiveness and sustainable urban development simultaneously. With the growing majority of the population living in such cities, the necessity for them to efficiently manage their services, such as highways, public transportation, water supplies, sewage systems and street lighting, is increasingly important. In the more rural areas there are other challenges related to the very low population density. In each of these two areas, the importance of acting on the current and predicted environmental conditions allows organisations to utilise their assets better, to improve the traffic flow at peak times, reduce pollution and increase crop yields.
Cumulocity and Libelium recognise that the deployment and operation of IoT sensing, visualisation and analytics technologies need to be simple to allow the organisations managing large urban and rural areas to take full advantage of the value of the data they produce.
Libelium is an early pioneer in wireless sensor network technology. The Libelium Waspmote Plug & Sense! nodes have 120 sensors to cover hundreds of IoT applications such as smart water, smart cities and smart agriculture. Energy saving settings now extend the nodes lifetime from 5 to 10 years. Libelium’s Meshium IoT gateway is an industrialised IP67 compliant Linux router which can include WiFi, 3G/GPRS, Bluetooth, Zigbee and GPS. Being optionally solar and battery powered, the Meshium is applicable to many mobile, vehicular and outdoor use cases.

We are delighted to have Cumulocity as a Libelium Certified Cloud Partner. We have already received considerable interest from the market about our joint proposition and together look forward to supporting more customers make their city, agriculture and water environments smarter. Alicia Asín, Chief Executive Officer, Libelium

Cumulocity’s IoT application and device management platform has a full feature set for realising and scaling IoT solutions rapidly. The measurement data from the Libelium Meshium IoT gateways can be rapidly visualised and combined with other connected assets, such as traffic light systems, industrial pumps and tractors. Streaming analytics can be run across the data from all devices, with the resultant actions alerting enterprise business systems or sending commands to change the state of the actuators on a controlled asset.

Smart cities and smart environment will be two key focus areas for organisations over the next decade. IoT radically changes our understanding of what is considered possible, with the control of highway traffic, water quality and soil irrigation all based on the real-time senor data. The combination of Libelium’s wireless sensor network technologies and Cumulocity’s IoT platform allows organisations to retain their focus on stakeholder value and avoid the complexities associated with developing IoT solutions. Bernd Gross, CEO, Cumulocity

Cumulocity and Option Simplify the Adoption of Edge Analytics

Cumulocity and Option, an innovative Machine to Machine (M2M) wireless solution specialist, combine their IoT platform and IoT device technologies to radically simplify the adoption of IoT edge analytics processes for customers. The combination allows edge analytics models to be rapidly evolved using the Option Cloudgate LuvitRED device-based application and industrially deployed to the fielded devices with Cumulocity Device Management.
Dusseldorf, Germany — In recent years there has been a rapid growth in the use of computational analytics, none more so than in the Internet of Things (IoT). What originated as the detection of static thresholds (like power exceeding a specified value) has now evolved into applying far more complex formulae. Essentially building a synthetic mechanics ear which can anticipate the future operation of an asset based on their knowledge of how things should work and raise an alarm prior to failure. These formulae are now used at many points in the overall solution, with some assessing a single asset’s operation while others assess the combined process of multiple assets. The value of these techniques has grown exponentially with their complexity. However, it is this complexity that can slow their development and complicate their mass deployment.
Cumulocity and Option recognise the development and operation of IoT projects needs to be simple to ensure their efficient adoption for practical real-world situations. This combination of Cumulocity’s and Option’s technologies allows the edge analytics models to be continuously evolved by subject matter experts and be mass deployed to a scheduled release cycle into the field.

“There is no single standard at the edge, because the each vertical market brings its own hardware and interface protocol specifications. Option’s unique modular gateway, with its swappable expansion cards, provides the flexibility to connect almost any asset in any IoT vertical market at the highest quality and lowest total cost of ownership. In addition, Option’s unique LuvitRED software suite integrates the software protocols of the customer’s assets and applications seamlessly to the Cumulocity IoT platform. This combination provides a real end-to-end solution for customers!” Jörg Palm, Chief Marketing Officer, Option

LuvitRED is Option’s latest enhancement to the CloudGate solution, delivering a visually configurable agent for the design and deployment of smart IoT solutions using CloudGate wireless gateway devices. LuvitRED overcomes complexities of the vast variety of protocols used in different IoT verticals and delivers true IoT Edge Computing. With LuvitRED, stable and reliable IoT applications can be built and delivered faster, with less cost and risk. Processes that used to take days, weeks and months – even before testing and review – now take only minutes or hours.
Cumulocity’s Device Management capability provides the administration and management of the Edge Analytics applications, models and configuration data.  The platform’s bulk operations completely remove the complexities of mass deployments by executing update schedules for any number of groups of devices which are monitored in real-time. Roll-outs that would have consumed the resources of many field technicians are now avoided. The integrity of the device data presented to the customers’ business applications is now assured during the transition.

“Edge analytics is a powerful enabler for IoT services like predictive maintenance, which can significantly improve customer experience and reduce operational costs. Historically, the complexity of the development and deployment of the analytics model has slowed its adoption. The combination of the Option Cloudgate LuvitRED and Cumulocity IoT Platform allows customers to focus on the value of edge analytics and avoid the inconvenience of managing the practical deployment of these models. This provides all organisations with a low effort way to adopt edge analytics, and the reassurance that it will be commercially ready at scale as soon as required.”

Cumulocity and Device Authority partner to secure the remote deployment and management of industrial intellectual property

Cumulocity and Device Authority, a leading IoT Security Automation Platform provider, combine their technologies to allow design, manufacturing and industrial organisations a secure means for their intellectual property to be employed. The collaboration allows high-value industrial recipes, computer aided designs (CAD) and advanced machine configurations to be deployed securely and only readable by the application in the machine that will use it.
Dusseldorf, Germany - Manufacturing and process industries heavily invest in research and development to both develop products and optimise the process to manufacture them on an industrial scale. With the increasing sophistication of manufacturing techniques, process equipment and monitoring mechanisms a growing emphasis is being focused on the intellectual creations. This intellectual property (IP) can take the form of the industrial formulas, manufacturing recipes, computer aided designs and advanced machine configurations, and are often where a large proportion of a value in manufacturing and process industries reside. The protection of these assets in-life is therefore crucial.
Cumulocity, the leading IoT device and application platform provider, has been helping industrial organisations securely remotely monitor and control their machines around the world for over four years. Through use of Cumulocity’s carrier grade IoT platform, organisations have been able to optimise the operation of their remotely deployed machines for their customer needs and also perform preventative maintenance to ensure that the machines remain fully operational.

“Industrial internet of things security demands fresh thinking and fit for purpose solutions. The Device Authority platform has been designed from the ground up to deliver rapid security automation and active security posture enforcement to address the new security challenges. Our partnership with Cumulocity simplifies the implementation of policy and device-driven security for all IoT solutions.”
Darron Antill, CEO, Device Authority

Combining the capabilities of Device Authority’s, leading IoT Security Automation Platform, with Cumulocity provides organisations with the ability to encrypt the data between the systems within the organisation’s IT environment and the applications on the remotely deployed machines. This provides organisations with the reassurance that their intellectual property is only able to be read by the authorised application in the intended machine. The data is transferred in encrypted format throughout the solution and is only decrypted for authorised users on the IoT platform when requested. This allows the use of the intellectual property to be controlled by its owner, thereby avoiding costly machine misconfigurations, unauthorised duplication and reduction in competitive advantage.
The underlying end-to-end data encryption also provides the foundation for more use cases in other vertical markets which require irrefutable auditability and traceability of measurement data and highly-secure user authenticated visibility of information. Important examples here are supply chain management in the food industry and the monitoring of patient health and wellbeing.

“With more and more manufacturers digitising their operations, the necessity to control the usage of their valuable industrial recipes and designs has never been greater. This collaboration allows organisations to securely deploy and control their industrial intellectual property in live operational processes simply, reliably and comprehensively.”
Bernd Gross, CEO, Cumulocity

More...Did you know ?On the Infinancials platform, there are two ways to identify the listed peers which most closely resemble a private firm:- with Peer Tracker if you already know a listed peer.Peer Tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications. The degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores.- with Market Screener if you have no listed peer in mind.Market Screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria, identifying peers, searching for comparable companies in a specific business sector.About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
