Classified ads are a great way to list items, services, or properties for sale without creating an auction-style or fixed price listing. You can create a classified ad on eBay.com or on Close5 (formerly eBay Classifieds). Use eBay.com to let millions of buyers around the country see your listing, or choose Close5 (www.close5.com)  and focus your selling locally. The table below shows the benefits of each option:

Choosing eBay.com or Close5 
eBay.com
Close5 Free
 
Interested buyers can email or call you directly.
 
List your asking price. No bidding takes place.

Advertise only to buyers near you, ideal for pickup-only items.
 
National (or international) exposure to reach millions of potential buyers.

 List your item, service, or property for a specific period of time.

Revise item-specific information at any time while the ad is active.


Note: Buyers and sellers who transact through a classified ad on eBay.com or Close5 can't leave or receive Feedback and aren't covered by eBay Buyer Protection.
Fees
It's free to use Close5. Fees on eBay.com vary depending on the category and listing duration. For specific fee and category information, see fees for Classified Ads on eBay.com. 
Rules for eBay.com
Sellers on eBay.com who use the Classified Ad format are given the contact information of interested buyers. Sellers must treat the buyer's contact information in a way that follows our User Privacy Notice. This policy prohibits the sharing of buyer information with third parties. It also prohibits sellers from using a buyer's information for any purpose other than communicating with the buyer about the item, unless expressly permitted to do so by the buyer. If you don't follow these guidelines you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges and suspension of your account.
