Happy Clients





















Initech helped us with improving the performance of our Totally Pregnant app and in developing a Hebrew iOS version. We arrived with a need and they offered us the right solution for it. The developers who worked with us demonstrated a high level of commitment to the success of the project and achieved with profession all the goals that we set.





Initech helped us with the development of our product, complex in both backend logic and in the level of frontend finish. The team excelled in both commitment and motivation, was attentive to our needs, and skilled in answering each and every one of them. We'll definitely use their services in the future!





As an entrepreneur, the team you choose to work with has a crucial impact on the success of a project. I contacted Initech in order to form a clearer concept for the implementation of my project. The team understood exactly what my goals were, succeeded in forming a suitable concept and created an awesome user experience for my project. I am very pleased with the outcome and feel like they managed to answer all my requirements. I would be happy to continue working with them as the project evolves.





Initech is a long-time technology partner of ours. They assisted us in a range of systems and technologies and constantly exhibited highest level of technical competence. Working with them is truly a one-stop-shop experience, from html5 UI to sql optimization to cloud infrastructure management. Highly recommended!





We started out with live UI mockups for our flagship product, and gradually, the project expanded into creating a next generation UI for the whole product line. Besides the latter, Initech assisted us with a number of other projects. They are very efficient, cooperative, innovative, and a great asset to have on board!





We introduced Initech to help us with a few development tasks. The company provided us with a team of talented engineers who catered to all aspects of our requirements and invested great effort into improving our internal infrastructure and capabilities. We are learning a lot from our collaboration and are delighted to work with such a skilled service provider.





Initech is helping us develop the web interface for Testuff’s award-winning test suite application. They are competent and tech savvy, think out-of-the-box and are very responsive. Working with them proved as the right decision for achieving the project's goals.





Initech’s team delivered and maintains an end-to-end web solution for our core product. Their responsiveness and execution are commendable, but what’s more important, they are fully dedicated to the success of the project, which is why we choose to work with Initech time and again.





I approached the folks at Initech to help me develop a prototype for a browser extension. Working with them was a fulfilling and satisfying experience - I felt like I teamed up with committed and highly skilled partners for my venture. They were transparent and forthcoming with me about schedule, technical difficulties and proposed solutions. Most importantly, they delivered the right product according to my requirements.





The guys at Initech assisted with the product’s architecture and delivered the implementation on budget and on time. A very positive experience, will be glad to do business with them again.
