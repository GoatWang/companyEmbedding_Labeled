						Jian ePayment Systems Limited has pioneered the development and application of contractless smart card (Jian Smart Pass) payment systems in the PRC.  The Group has also developed and operated the Jian ePayment clearing system together with supporting hardware and software.The Group first commenced applications with a focus on developing roadside car parking fee collection systems helping the authorities to improve the operations of the country's roads and transport systems.  Then it developed, established and applied the "One Card Multiple Uses" system for roadside parking, supermarkets, pharmaceutical chain stores and convenient stores.Our three major business areas are (1) the development and sale of e-payment systems hardware and software, including smart card readers, opeation programs and related technology, (2) systems integration services such as the design and installation services such as the design and installation of hardware and software, computer servers and applications software for customer sub-systems; and (3) after-sales services.  In other words, we offer our business partners, merchants and vendors, comprehensive "one stop" services that can take care of their own specific needs when adopting e-payment systems.With many of our researchers possessing extensive experience gained from working in state level reseach organizations, our R&D team boasts reseach capabilities that meet international standards.  This explains that many awards and accreditation we have received from the government and various organizaitons.  These include ISO9001 certification for our quality technological achievements, which was received in April 2001.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
