Nyherji Group Announces Strong Income Growth and Positive First Quarter Performance


REYKJAVIK, Iceland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Nyherji Group (NYHR.IC), Iceland’s leading IT services provider, 
      announces its results for the first quarter 2017.
    

Financial Highlights:



        Sales of goods and services up 20% to ISK 3.996 billion in Q1 [Q1 
        2016: ISK 3.332 billion]
      

        Gross margin of ISK 976 million (24.4%) in Q1 [Q1 2016: ISK 885 
        million (26.6%)]
      

        EBITDA of ISK 242 million (6%) in Q1 [Q1 2016: ISK 180 million (5.4%)]
      

        Total profit for the first quarter amounted to ISK 71 million (1.8%) 
        [Q1 2016: ISK 38 million (1.1%)]
      

        Equity ratio was 39.7% at the end of the first quarter, compared with 
        33.7% at the end of 2016
      

        Interest-bearing long-term debt was reduced by ISK 300 million in the 
        first quarter
      

        Employees exercised share options at a total purchase price of ISK 149 
        million in Q1 in early April
      


      "Nyherji’s operations have progressed well over the quarter and are on 
      track,” commented Finnur Oddsson, Group CEO, “We are pleased with the 
      earnings and continued revenue growth, which has improved 20% 
      year-on-year. Our positive performance has contributed to lower debt and 
      strengthening of our equity ratio, which is now at its strongest level 
      for many years.
    

      Sales of computers and audiovisual solutions remain, as ever, a major 
      part of our operations, however revenues from hosting and operating 
      services are rising proportionately, with new projects such as the 
      outsourcing of IT operations from Arion Bank contributing from the start 
      of the year.
    

      The growth of software-related operations have been driving the 
      Company's income growth over the recent quarters, and increased emphasis 
      on product development is now starting to be visible in sales of our own 
      solutions. We see substantial gains in subscription income from Kjarni, 
      payroll and human resource application from our Applicon subsidiary, up 
      almost a third year-on-year, and ongoing work on innovation and 
      development projects holds promise for the future. Implementation of 
      core banking systems for SBAB in Sweden is off to a good start and 
      represents a substantial engagement for our professional consulting 
      teams, both is Sweden and in Iceland.
    

      TM Software is continuing to deliver robust revenue growth, show strong 
      performance and exciting product development projects. Tempo also 
      continues to perform very well with revenue for the quarter at USD $4.4 
      million, a 46% increase. Customer numbers grew to 10,000, a major 
      milestone reflecting the strength of Tempo offerings. There are now more 
      than 100 Tempo partners and distributors worldwide, and approximately 
      fifteen employees working at our offices in Canada and the United 
      States, with further growth planned.
    

      Overall I am pleased to report a positive outlook and solid demand 
      across most areas of the Group, in particular hosting, operating 
      services and our various software solutions."

Group employees exercise option


      A large share of Nyherji's employees exercised their call option to 
      purchase Company stock in 2016 at the price of ISK 17.095; a total of 
      8,739,986 shares. The stock option plan is valid for another two years. 
      In addition to those who took out stock option agreements last year, 
      more than 90 employees of the Nyherji Group joined and subscribed to 
      stock option agreements for the purchase of 3,663,396 shares at the 
      price of ISK 29.89. The stock option plan applies to all permanent 
      employees of the group, whereby each employee can buy shares for up to 
      ISK 600,000 per year, with a minimum purchase of ISK 10,000 per year.
    

Increased demand for Nyherji’s hosting and operating services


      Nyherji saw revenue growth across most divisions of the parent company 
      in the first quarter, an increase of 12% compared with the same period 
      last year, with the most significant growth (+20%) coming from hosting 
      and operating services. Nyherji took over the outsourced operation of 
      Arion Bank's IT Systems at the beginning of 2017, consisting of core 
      systems, technology platform and services for employees. Over 20 
      employees, previously employed by Arion Bank's technical services, began 
      work at Nyherji at the start of the year.
    

Applicon increases recurring license income in Iceland


      Applicon's performance in Iceland, where it specializes in consulting, 
      services and business software development, exceeded expectations this 
      quarter. Total revenue from Applicon amounted to ISK 319 million, an 
      increase of 23% over the same period last year, despite the fact that 
      almost 40% of income is in foreign currency. Successful sales of the 
      Kjarni human resource and payroll system increased recurring license 
      revenue by 170% over the period. Applicon's professional experts in 
      Iceland are making great efforts to implement core SAP systems in 
      Sweden, which will deliver steady income over the coming months. 
      Benefits from a new version of Applicon's online bank, which includes an 
      automatic credit application system, have also started to flow through. 
      The outlook is generally positive and the firm will continue to invest 
      in developing future solutions for the Icelandic market.
    

Major projects have a positive impact on Applicon Sweden


      Applicon's revenues in Sweden increased by almost a third compared to 
      the previous year, with major projects for the Swedish banks SBAB and 
      Landshypotek Bank the principle drivers. The implementation of core 
      banking solutions from SAP got off to a good start with SBAB and 
      Applicon has also introduced a new mortgage solution for Landshypotek 
      Bank during the period.
    

      Software company SAP chose Applicon in Sweden as partner for the year 
      2016 and Applicon also received recognition as SAP Innovation Partner of 
      the Year for expertise in banking software solutions, for its 
      understanding of the challenges faced in the development of digital 
      solutions for finance and for attracting new customers into this area. 
      The outlook for operations is good.
    

Increased revenue and good performance at TM Software


      TM Software, which specializes in the development of own software 
      products and specialized software solutions, increased revenues by 14% 
      compared with the same period last year. There was a solid demand for 
      services and solutions in all three areas of health solutions, travel 
      solutions and custom solutions. Significant emphasis has been placed on 
      development efforts recently, both to strengthen existing products and 
      create new ones. The project pipeline for the next months is robust and 
      the outlook for operations is good.
    

Continued revenue growth and building of Tempo’s international 
      presence


      Tempo's revenue, which develops time tracking and management solutions, 
      increased by 46% compared with the same quarter last year. The Company's 
      income has increased continuously since its foundation, and last month, 
      achieved its 10,000th customer, manufacturer Mercedes Benz, 
      which purchase the entire Tempo suite for their operations in the United 
      States. Mercedes Benz joins a growing group of automakers using Tempo 
      solutions: BMW, Volkswagen, Mazda, Audi, Scania, Volvo and Skoda.
    

      Tempo has been expanding rapidly in recent months, looking to double the 
      number of employees outside of Iceland by year-end. Tempo currently 
      operates in Montreal and San Francisco, and is intending to open a new 
      location in Europe in the coming months. The Company has more than 100 
      partners and distributors worldwide.
    

      Last year, Tempo undertook its largest development project, investing in 
      infrastructure to make it possible to offer services via its own private 
      cloud. Having completed this, more than 2000 customers have already 
      signed up to Tempo’s cloud service and being able to offer cloud
