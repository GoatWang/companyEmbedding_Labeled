PRODUCT SHOWCASE
Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic
Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (sometimes referred to as Fiberglass Reinforced Polymer) products are a composite of fiberglass and a plastic or polymer resin that when combined, offer a stronger, more durable, more corrosion and heat-resistant product than is found anywhere else.
Using a mold to create the finished product, fiberglass is generally thermoset with a type of plastic or epoxy resin. When cured, the end product will hold its shape because of the resin, while the fiberglass will provide strength and stiffness. Just as important, the resin has additional corrosion- and heat-resistant properties not found in any type of metal products. This technology has led to increased durability and strength in hostile and corrosive environments such as chemical processing plants, food processing, waste water treatment and sewage centers, HVAC, semiconductor plants, power generator facilities, fuel storage tanks and more.

Somersworth, NH - 
January 25, 2017 — 
Airex Manufacturing Inc.® the leader in unique energy efficient and sustainable performing HVAC code compliant products, and 
ARCOM, the leader in specifications, are pleased to announce that Airex Manufacturing Inc. product data and customized specifications are available through ARCOM’s software platforms to architects, engineers and design professionals.
 
ARCOM and Airex Manufacturing Inc. have worked together to create customized versions of the industry-trusted MasterSpec® sections to accurately specify the unique products of Airex Manufacturing Inc. Along with these specification sections, the Airex Manufacturing Inc. product catalog and data sheets are easily accessible to specifiers when working on their projects.
 
Airex Manufacturing Inc. is leading a new wave of performance products that support the U.S. Building, Energy, and Green Codes of today. Going forward, our innovations improve on current building energy efficiencies and indoor health environment strategies. “We believe that concentrating on high performance HVAC equipment only, limits a complete building energy efficient strategy,” said Gabriel V Lechuga Sr., Founder & President of Airex. “Therefore, a detailed specification guide is now being provided thru 
MasterSpec to assist the specifier, helping to ensure the required detailed communication between the specifier and installer so that installers properly seal and protect outdoor wall penetrations, and to also include outdoor refrigeration piping insulation protection, as is now being mandated and required by codes.”
 
ARCOM and Airex Manufacturing Inc. believe this relationship will benefit all design professionals as they select and specify products. 
 
Visit Airex at the ASHRAE expo in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 30 – February 1, 2017, booth #N10206. 

About 
Airex Manufacturing Inc.

Airex Manufacturing Inc.® located in Southern California and incorporated in 2009, began by manufacturing the AIREX E-FLEX GUARD™ (protector for outdoor refrigeration piping insulation) for the HVAC Industry. Thereafter the AIREX TITAN OUTLET™ (seal for wall penetrations of refrigeration piping) was innovated thru intense product engineering, design, premium material selection, and rigorous laboratory testing.  After both products were developed by 2012, a beta phase of real-field installs and market testing thru select distribution followed. Each individual product has now established unanimous favorable market acceptance, and approvals by technical committees within the Building and HVAC Industries and are readily available in the market place.

 

Specifying Airex Manufacturing Inc. ensures that all technical installation requirements and instructions of both HVAC Equipment Manufactures and HVAC Pipe Insulation Manufactures, including Energy and Building Codes will be satisfied and met. Leading HVAC Equipment Manufactures now require in their technical installation instructions the need for isolation, anti-vibration, insulation of refrigeration piping, and also require a weatherized and physical protective cover for all outdoor refrigeration piping use. Leading HVAC pipe insulation manufactures, now require in their technical installation instructions the need for insulation to be protected and covered, yet still maintain both inherent permeability performance, and at the same time protect outdoor refrigeration piping insulation from weatherization, physical damage, while ensuring ease of maintenance (removable/reusable). Recent Energy and Building Codes no longer allow the past method use of adhesive tapes as an approved protective covering on outdoor refrigeration piping insulation.

 

Airex Manufacturing Inc. strategically began a build design phase, focusing on a select number of specifiers. After an in-depth market consultation stage, an All-In-One solution was generated offering both products together, now known as the AIREX PRO-SYSTEM KIT™ (accomplishing improved sustainability energy efficiency and optimum performance of building walls, HVAC equipment, and outdoor pipe insulation). Now having the full support of architects, engineers, specifiers, and designers it has moved into the BIM phase. Due to the multi-dimensional complexities of the recent building energy code requirements and standards within this category, Airex Manufacturing Inc. has now included its product line on ARCOM’s platform for an easier and more efficient experience to the specifier. Please visit 
www.airexmfg.com for CAD drawings 2D /3D files, brochures, submittals, or for any additional information.

 


About 
ARCOM

ARCOM, the specification experts, exclusively publishes 
MasterSpec®, a product of the 
American Institute of Architects(AIA), reaching over 60,000 design professionals involved in building projects. ARCOM owns and publishes 
SpecText®for use by engineers for infrastructure projects, including water and wastewater utilities and equipment. ARCOM provides extensive product and manufacturer information through cloud-based specification resources, custom manufacturer specifications, and the SpecBuilder Expert platform. ARCOM's innovative software specification tools and resources dramatically simplify specification creation, research, and project management.
