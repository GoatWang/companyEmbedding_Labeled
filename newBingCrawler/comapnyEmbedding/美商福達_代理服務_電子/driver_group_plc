                                Delta PLCs adopt the highly accessible programming software ISPSoft, integrating the main functions that include control process programming, hardware configuration, network configuration, motion control programming and providing convenient wizards and a graphical interface for these functions. In addition, users of ISPSoft can choose their most efficient programming tools from the 5* supported languages: Ladder Diagram (LD), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Sequential Function Chart (SFC), Instruction List (IL) and Structured Text (ST).*Note: supported languages may differ according to the selected model.

About us

The Technology Partnership was established over 25 years ago to create a world-leading technology and development organisation. Today that enterprise has evolved and grown into TTP Group, a range of businesses focussed on meeting the needs of companies planning to flourish through the use of technology and innovation.

In keeping with the origins, the Group's companies have evolved and continue to develop break-through new products, apply the latest innovations and in many cases develop new technology to meet commercial needs.

As the enterprise has grown, new companies have been created, some of which have remained within TTP Group, while others have been sold, demerged or floated on the London Stock Exchange.

The following gives a short overview of some of the highlights in the history of the formation of the companies of TTP Group.
