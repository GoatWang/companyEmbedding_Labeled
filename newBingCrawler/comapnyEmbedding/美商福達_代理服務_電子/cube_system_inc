Testimonials



"NXTera's support for Ingres makes it easier for open source developers and enterprises committed to high-speed computing to engineer fast multi-tiered applications based on Ingres Database 9.2.  We see Ingres and eCube technology delivering real benefits in our key markets of government, sciences, manufacturing, and media."

Bill Maimone
Senior Vice President of Worldwide Engineering at Ingres






"eCube Systems is an integral part of the future of the VMS ecosystem. Our relationship with eCube and NXTware Remote will play an enabling role in the modernization of OpenVMS development and user's ability to quickly and efficiently develop and extend valuable enterprise applications."

Duane Harris
President of VMS Software Inc.






"DreamFace Interactive is excited to have eCube Systems as a partner. Their dedication to legacy modernization and their comprehensive Web 2.0 solution offerings make them an ideal partner. Companies that select eCube to assist them in evaluating DreamFace and implementing enterprise Web 2.0 solutions will accomplish their goals quickly and with a compelling return on investment."

Olivier Poupeney
Co-founder and CTO of Dreamface






"We are honored to have eCube Systems as a strategic partner and we look forward to demonstrating how VisiBroker shines within the NXTminder architecture.  Companies are looking at commercial CORBA again for ISV and embedded applications. We are seeing that ISVs, like eCube systems, expect more from their middleware infrastructure. We are witnessing a reversal of a historic trend. Companies are now converting from Open Source CORBA to VisiBroker. This is because VisiBroker continues to provide a well-supported, high performance, stable, and consistent platform that allows companies to build innovative products."
