Waste Electrical and Electronic Product DisposalThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2006 (known as the WEEE Regulations) came into effect in the UK on the 1st July 2007. These Regulations are designed to encourage the recycling and environmentally sound disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and to reduce the amount being thrown away in household bins and ultimately ending up in landfill.
Every year the UK throws away over 2 million tonnes of waste electrical and electronic equipment. If WEEE ends up in landfill sites, the components of the products can break down to produce toxins that can cause soil and water contamination. This can have harmful effects on natural habitats, wildlife and human health. For this reason, consumers are being encouraged to help minimise the impact of waste on our environment by having their waste electrical and electronic goods recycled or re-used.
At Value Products we are aware of our responsibilities under the WEEE Regulations and are providing a free method of disposal of your old electrical or electronic equipment. As a responsible business we are working with our WEEE compliance scheme, Budget Pack, to ensure waste electricals are collected and recycled in an environmentally sound way.
Products that are covered by the WEEE Regulations display a crossed out wheelie bin symbol. This means these items should not be disposed of via normal household domestic waste bins and can be recycled instead.
More information on the proper disposal of electrical waste and to identify your nearest recycling facility please visit www.recyclenow.co.uk.
