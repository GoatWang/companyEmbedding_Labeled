EBITDA declined from R11.4 million to R7.0 million with an operating profit for the year of R5.6 million compared to R8.8 million. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders decreased to R7.4 million (2011: R8.2 million) and consequently, headline earnings per share fell from 8.05cps to 7.88cps. Outlook As part of its response to the regulatory issues facing its TES businesses, the group made investments in new products and services allied to its existing product and service range. This expenditure related to additional office infrastructure, improved technology, new course material and the employment of more personnel so as to provide increased capacity and capability in anticipation of future requirements. These costs will affect short-term earnings, particularly in the first half of the current year. Volume growth within existing operations and the continual review of operating expenditure to achieve optimal efficiencies remain group imperatives. The introduction of new products and services in the spheres of business process outsourcing and permanent recruitment has been undertaken. The group remains focussed on further developing its marketing and sales capability. All of these, taken together, are intended to enhance profitable sustainability for the group. Nevertheless, the prevailing business and operating environment dictates that the group's performance outlook remains conservative.28-Jun-2012(Official Notice)The company advised that it has discovered an error in its accounting records which require a prior year adjustment to its results. The adjustment in relation to results for the 15 month period ended 31 March 2011 is a reduction in profit after tax in the amount of R1.1 million. The adjustment gives rise to a reduction of earnings per share and headline earnings per share to 8.05 and 7.97 cents per share respectively. As a further result of the above, Primeserv shareholders are advised that Primeserv's headline and basic earnings per share for the twelve month period ended 31 March 2012 will be between 12% and 15% below the headline and basic earnings per share for the prior 15 month reported period ended 31 March 2011. Primeserv's headline and basic earnings per share for the twelve months ended 31 March 2012 will be between 1% and 4% below the restated headline and basic earnings per share for the 15 months ended 31 March 2011. The company anticipates that its results for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 will be released on SENS by no later than 29 June 2012.29-Nov-2011(C)Primeserv has changed its year end to March and therefore these are interim results for the period ending September. Revenue was R307.4 million (June 2010: R256.2 million). Gross profit amounted to R57.8 million (June 2010: R46.7 million) and EBITDA came in at R8.4 million (R6.5 million). Net profit attributable to shareholders was R5.3 million (June 2010: R3.8 million). In addition, headline earnings per share of 5.55c (June 2010: 3.58cps). DividendAn interim ordinary dividend of 0.5cps has been declared.ProspectsThe group strategy is that of an investment holding company in the services industry, and whilst it focuses on organically and acquisitively growing its existing staffing, skills development and HR consulting operations so as to broaden its service and product offerings, it is also actively seeking to diversify its revenue streams through a series of corporate activities. This strategy is aimed at enhancing the sustainability of the group. Volume growth within existing operations and the continual review of operating expenditure to obtain optimal efficiencies remains a group imperative. The group has also invested in a number of new programmes, particularly in the sphere of business process outsourcing, as well as having developed new resources that will deliver added value to clients and staff. An extensive and revitalised investment in marketing and sales is also being implemented. All of these, taken together, are intended to deliver improved top-line growth and increased profitability across all sectors of the group. Nevertheless, economic uncertainty, and the reluctance by many businesses to expand their own operations, render the group's own view of its performance for the full year as being cautiously optimistic.23-Nov-2011(Official Notice)The annual general meeting of Primeserv shareholders was held on Wednesday, 23 November 2011. All the ordinary resolutions other than resolution number 6 to place the authorised but unissued share capital under the control of the directors; and resolution number 7 the general authority on issue of shares and special resolutions as set out in the notice of annual general meeting to shareholders, dated 21 September 2011, were approved by the requisite majority of shareholders.

EBITDA was recorded at R13 million, while operating profit was at R10.4 million. The company reported a net profit attributable to shareholders of R9.3 million and headline earnings per share was recorded at 9.08cps. The economic environment for the fifteen months to 31 March 2011 continued to be challenging. Both business and consumer confidence remained under pressure. This situation was further exacerbated by the persistent debate relating to the Temporary Employment Services ("TES") industry. The resulting uncertainty affected the group's operations with businesses curtailing expenditure relating to skills development, training and employment. Notwithstanding this, the group's overall results were encouraging and it is well positioned for an anticipated economic upturn. DividendNotice is hereby given that Primeserv has declared a final dividend for the 15 months ended 31 March 2011 of 2.50cps.ProspectsPrimeserv's strategy is that of an investment holding company in the services industry, and whilst the group focuses on organically and acquisitively developing its existing staffing, skills development and HR consulting operations so as to broaden its service and product offerings, it is also actively seeking to diversify its revenue streams through a series of corporate activities. This strategy is aimed at enhancing the ongoing sustainability and growth of the group. The pace of the country's economic recovery is expected to remain constrained in the short term. The group is cautiously optimistic regarding performance in the year ahead. This general forecast has not been reviewed nor reported on by the company's auditors.   Further cautionary announcement                                                 Further to the cautionary announcement released on SENS on 20 May 2011 and published in the press on 23 May 2011, shareholders are advised that negotiations remain in progress which, if successfully concluded, may have a material effect on the price of the company's securities. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the company's securities until a full announcement is made.   20-May-2011(Official Notice)Shareholders were advised that negotiations are in progress which, if successfully concluded, may have a material effect on the price of the company's securities. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the company's securities until a full announcement is made.28-Mar-2011(Official Notice)Further to the cautionary announcement dated 2 March 2011, Primeserv shareholders are advised that Primeserv Staff Dynamix (Pty) Ltd, a subsidiary of Primeserv, has entered into an agreement requiring the payment of compensation arising out of the termination of service agreements for the provision of temporary employment services with customers of the vendors and the conclusion of such contracts with Primeserv ("the transaction").

DividendFurther to the change of year-end the company has not declared a second interim dividend but will consider a final dividend in respect of the fifteen month financial period ending 31 March 2011.OutlookThe group strategy is that of an investment holding company in the services industry, however, it will now be seeking to diversify its revenue streams through a series of corporate activities alongside its existing staffing, skills development and HR consulting operations. This strategy is expected to enhance the future sustainability of the group, and the funding thereof will result in an increase in the group's overall level of gearing. The group will continue to seek further acquisitions within its existing spheres of activity so as to expand its value offering to clients. The pace of the country's economic recovery remains uncertain and therefore it is anticipated that trading conditions will be restrictive and somewhat volatile.

How the pricing works
Trades are executed at the live price on the underlying exchange at the time your order is received, as a result the price that you invest at may differ from the price displayed. Further to this you are buying at the Offer Price which is the price at which sellers are currently prepared to sell.
The difference between all three prices quoted is an indication of the current interest investors have in this share. The bigger the difference between the prices, the smaller the interest/liquidity in the share i.e. there are limited buyers and sellers of this share. Investors should be cautious when buying or selling shares with lower liquidity.
