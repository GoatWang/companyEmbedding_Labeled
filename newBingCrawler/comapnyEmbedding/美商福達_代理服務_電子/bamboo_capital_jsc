                Last update 08:30 | 28/05/2017  FacebookTwitteraddthis_button_compactSend EmailPrinterBUSINESS IN BRIEF 28/5Petrolimex enjoys huge benefits through treasury stock sale     The Viet Nam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) has announced the sale of all 20 million registered treasury shares at a transaction value five times higher than par value.According to the group, the shares were purchased at an average price of VND50,553 (US$2.22) from May 4 to 23 through transactions at the HCM Stock Exchange.The sale helps draw Petrolimex’s stock closer to joining the VN30 Index, which tracks the performance of the 30 largest firms by market capitalisation. It is required that stocks of all the company in the list must have free-float rate of at least 5 per cent.Before being listed on the stock market, the Petrolimex rate was 3.6 per cent.Petrolimex owns more than 135 million treasury stocks after the sale.Bamboo Capital targets 30 per cent growth     Bamboo Capital JSC has set revenue and profit targets of VND1.77 trillion (US$78.3 million) and VND81 billion this year, 8 per cent and 30 per cent higher than last year.Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting in HCM City on Thursday, Nguyen Thanh Hung, BCG’s deputy general director, said in the short term, exports would be the main contributor to revenues and profit.This year, the company plans to increase exports of cocoa, cassava starch, coffee and micro-organic fertilisers.It will speed up work on a BOT project to widen and upgrade DT830 road in Long An Province and do a study on building a part of the North - South expressway project, social housing for workers in Long An Province, and other projects.Renewable energy, especially solar, is also in its long-term plans, Hung said. BCG has already received approval to build four solar farms, including two in Long An.Nguyễn Hồ Nam, BCG’s chairman, said South Korea’s Green Eggs Co., Ltd, which owns a 3.5 per cent stake in BCG, plans to invest an additional $10 million in the company for the solar projects in Long An.Nam said agricultural production and trading, infrastructure, real estate and renewable energy are among the company’s core businesses in the 2017-20.In 2015-17, agriculture accounted for the biggest share of profits, but from 2020 renewable energy, infrastructure and real estate would take over, he said.The company did not pay dividends last year but will be 6 per cent for 2017. Sacom Investment makes fruitful start to year     Sacom Investment and Development Joint Stock Company (SAM Holdings), a telecom manufacturer and distributor, reported good numbers for the first quarter.It has achieved revenues of VND481 billion (US$21 million), or 33 per cent of its full-year target.Net profit was VND29 billion ($1.2 million), or 30 per cent of the target.SAM attributed the high revenues to financial investment, which brought in VND94.5 billion ($4.1 million), 45 per cent higher than in the whole of last year.The company said selling its stake in Hiep Phu Real Estate Company had yielded a profit of 66 per cent.It is withdrawing from certain projects and plans to invest that money elsewhere for higher returns, it said. UPCoM gets new classification rules     The Ha Noi Stock Exchange (HNX) recently issued a stock classification code on the Unlisted Public Company Market (UPCoM), in order to help investors keep closer watch on existing companies’ owners’ equity and prepare to categorise a large number of goods to be released into the market soon.Classification rules on the UPCoM will categorise registered stocks into three categories, except for stocks on the Investors Warning list.Under the system, stocks issued by companies or organisations with a registered owner’s equity of more than VND1 trillion (US$44.67 million) will belong to the UPCoM Large category, while stocks from those with VND300 billion ($13.4 million) to VND1 trillion in equity will be classified as UPCoM Medium. The UPCoM Small is for those from VND10 billion ($446,747) to below VND300 million.These lists will be displayed on the live screens at the HNX’s headquarter in Ha Noi and will be reviewed and updated on an annual basis. There are exceptions for stocks whose companies fail to meet the required level of capital, stocks being replaced by another or exchanged between lists.UPCoM classification, based on levels of current capital, will sort registered companies’ stocks into their respective list according to the company’s owner’s equity, which will be calculated from the closest balance sheet stated in the latest audited and published financial report.In case the registered organisation is the mother company of another firm or is a firm with non legal entity subsidiaries, owner’s equity will simply be based on audited financial reports.The new classification rule will replace the UPCoM Premium currently being used, and the official list of categorised stocks will be published by the HNX on June 24, 2017 on the occasion of the UPCoM’s eighth year in operation.For the first five months of 2017, 125 businesses have been newly listed on the UPCoM, with an average of 10.74 million shares being traded each session, amounting to VND202.9 billion ($9.06 million). This marks a 10.2 per cent increase in terms of quantity traded and 62.4 per cent in terms of quality compared to the same period in 2016.At the end of Thursday’s session, there were a total of 540 listed companies on the UPCoM, with VND419 trillion ($18.71 billion) in capital and VND185.55 trillion ($8.28 billion) in traded value. TTC Sugar to take over BHS in a 300m share swap merger     hanh Thanh Cong Tay Ninh Sugar JSC (TTCS) will make a share swap to fully acquire Bien Hoa Sugar JSC in order to create the biggest sugar producer in Viet Nam.TTCS will issue nearly 304 million shares to convert all outstanding shares of Bien Hoa Sugar at a ratio of 1:1.02. In other words, each share of Bien Hoa Sugar is equal to 1.02 shares of TTCS.The conversion ratio was calculated by a third-party company that valued each share of TTCS and Bien Hoa Sugar at VND20,944 (93 US cents) and VND21,356, respectively.The share swap will help TTCS take total control of Bien Hoa Sugar’s capital. The deal will be carried out within 90 days plus additional time (if needed), starting from the day TTCS receives the permit from the State Securities Commission on share issuance.The merger will increase the chartered capital of TTCS by more than VND3 trillion ($133.3 million) to VND5.57 trillion.After the merger is completed, Bien Hoa Sugar will be renamed to Thanh Thanh Cong Bien Hoa-Dong Nai Sugar Co Ltd to marks TTCS’s sole ownership of the company.TTCS expects its combined revenue will reach VND8.35 trillion after the merger, and its combined pre-tax profit will tap VND674 billion.The merger is also expected to help TTCS accrue a 30 per cent market share in Viet Nam. The new company will have total assets of VND14.67 trillion and total payable assets of VND7.86 trillion.TTCS shares, listed as SBT on the HCM Stock Exchange, are trading near the all-time high of VND29,000. SBT closed Thursday at VND28,450.Shares of Bien Hoa Sugar are listed on the same bourse as BHS and also move around the all-time high of VND20,000. BHS ended Thursday at VND20,050.TTCS chairman Pham Hong Duong said at the company’s extraordinary shareholder meeting held on Thursday that the M&A between the two firms will help TTCS heighten its position in the sugar market and improve its quality of financial management, corporate governance and business operations.The merger will combine good qualities of two sides, which include a strong retail network and good reputation for Bien Hoa Sugar and good production for TTCS, Duong said. He also said that the post-merger company will be able to create more added values and reduce its total cost.According to a report presented by Bao Viet Securities (BVSC) at the meeting, the post-merger company will have 40,000ha of total planting area, equal to 16 per cent of total sugarcane area across the country.The brokerage also said that the post-merger company will have an average annual growth rate of 6.6 per cent, while doubled capital will help the new firm negotiate with suppliers to reduce input costs.In addition, TTCS will be able to share the retail network of Bien Hoa Sugar to slash its selling cost and increase its profit, resulting in the rise of price of company’s shares and benefiting its shareholders.Short-term deposit rates forecast to reduce in 2017     The market research company Market Intello forecast that the average interest rate this year would reduce by 0.5 percentage points compared with 2016.In the “Vietnam Macroeconomic Report - May 2017” released this week, Market Intello expected the short-term deposit rates to drop to 4.5 per cent for the three-month term and 6.3 per cent for the 12-month term due to inflation management measures of the State Bank of Viet Nam and the Government.The research company also anticipated that exchange rates would increase by between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent as the US Federal Reserve’s plans to raise rates twice in June and September may put pressure on the exchange rate.In addition, the trade deficit may make the demand for US dollars rise much more than in 2016, it said, adding however, that the Vietnamese dong will not be depressed because of the ability to control inflation below 4 per cent and abundant foreign reserves of the State Bank of Viet Nam.Under the report, Market Intello also maintain its forecast for Viet Nam’s economic growth at 6.1 per cent in 2017.“Agriculture is expected to recover slightly but the decline in the mining industry will impact the economic growth considerably,” it said.Market Intello cut the CPI forecast to around 3.8 per cent, explaining that raising electricity prices could push up inflation in the third quarter, but weak domestic demand will hold inflation under the inflation target.According to Market Intello, boosting investment from the domestic economic sector should be the biggest challenge in improving Viet Nam’s economy for the rest of the year.“The Government has taken actions to accelerate capital disbursement from the State budget and improve the business environment for the private sector. However, until April 2017, the rate of capital disbursement from the budget was slower than the target rate,” it said. VN FDI inflow lags through May     Foreign direct investment (FDI) into Viet Nam reached US$12.13 billion in the first five months of this year, surging 10.4 per cent against the same period last year.The period’s FDI increase was much lower than the 40.5 per cent growth seen in the first four months, latest statistics from the Foreign Investment Agency revealed.On the other hand, FDI disbursement saw a positive rise of 6 per cent to $6.15 billion in five months, compared with a 3.2 per cent increase recorded in four-month capital disbursement.Some 939 projects with registered capital of $5.59 billion were newly registered from January to May, down 26.1 per cent year-on-year. Additional capital for 437 existing projects stood at $4.74 billion, up 83 per cent year-on-year.During the reviewed period, foreign investors also contributed capital or bought stake with total value of $1.79 billion, up 116.2 per cent year-on-year.The processing and manufacturing sector received the most FDI, at $8.09 billion, accounting for 66.7 per cent of the total FDI registered in the country. The mining sector ranked second with $1.28 billion, or 10.5 per cent, while the wholesale and retail sector came third with $798 million, or 6.5 per cent.South Korea remained Viet Nam’s leading source of foreign investment in five months, with $4.41 billion, contributing 36.4 per cent of the total. It was followed by Japan and Singapore with $1.94 billion, or 16 per cent, and $1.23 billion, or 10.21 per cent, respectively. HCM City licenses two foreign projectsThe southern hub city on Wednesday granted investment licences to two foreign-invested projects with total registered capital of nearly $90 million, baodautu.vn reported.The first, Cau Tre food processing factory, worth some $53.5 million, will be built on 7.1ha area in the Hiep Phuoc Industrial Zone. It is financed by CJ Cau Tre Food JSC, a joint venture between State-owned Saigon Trading Corporation (Satra) and CJ Cheijedang Corp, a subsidiary of South Korean conglomerate CJ Group.The second, invested by Taiwanese Viet Nam Paiho Co, will produce high-quality cloth for sports and healthcare. The $34 million factory will cover 8.2ha in the Le Minh Xuan 3 Industrial Zone. Coal exports surge in four monthsVietnam’s total coal export volume in the first four months of the year surged five times from the same time last year to more than 544,000 tonnes, according to statistics from the General Department of Customs.The department said that Vietnam pocketed 83.6 million USD from coal shipments during the period, a 9.5 times increase year-on-year.Average coal export price rocketed to nearly 154 USD per tonne, much higher than 79 USD per tonne during January-April in 2016.Notably, China was no longer Vietnam’s key export market in the period with the major coal importers being Japan and Malaysia.According to a master plan for the coal sector by 2020 with a vision to 2030, coal output is expected to reach 47-50 million tonnes by 2020 and 55-57 million tonnes by 2030. However, domestic demand for coal is forecast to be double local production output, about 112.3 million tonnes by 2020 and 220.3 million by 2030.Anti-money laundry system put into use in Orient BankThe international standard anti-money laundering (AML) system was officially put into use in the Orient Joint Stock Commercial Bank (OCB) on May 25.The system was installed under a project implemented by the OCB, consultancy firm Fintek Company Limited and Malaysian TESS International. It aims to ensure information security for customers and to prevent money laundering and illegal transactions.The AML system provides preeminent models and methods to filter customer information based on black lists, warning lists, embargo lists and more. It also discovers and investigates suspicious transactions not in line with customers’ business operations.According to Dao Minh Anh, OCB’s Deputy General Director in charge of risk management, the project is a significant move in building a transparent management system and complying with legal regulations.The system demonstrates the bank’s strategy in developing management tools and assuring security in all transactions, she said.She said that the OCB aims to complete its risk management system in line with Base II standards that include recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.Tax authorities to take closer look at foreign retailersThe General Department of Taxation has asked local tax authorities to inspect foreign retailers operating in Vietnam to see if they are transfer pricing or shifting profits to avoid tax.Tax authorities will audit corporate, value added and personal income tax paid by these retailers between 2012 and 2016.The department will also monitor the use of brand names in the form of franchising or ownership transfer among foreign retailers.Transfer pricing is not illegal per se, but it is a gray area that tax agencies keep a close eye on. Abuse of the practice is often very difficult to prove, especially when it involves multinational corporations with a complex network of internal buyers and suppliers.Vietnam’s retail market grew 10.2% last year with total sales reaching VND2,670 trillion (US$117.6 billion), according to the General Statistics Office.The country, recently ranked by A.T. Kearney among the world's top 30 retail markets with the best opportunities, has seen many foreign arrivals.BigC supermarket chain, MM Mega Market (previously Metro Vietnam), electronics chain Nguyen Kim and Aeon Vietnam are several of the major foreign retailers operating in the country.In 2015 retail giant Central, run by Thailand's third-richest family, the Chirathivats, made headlines with its US$200 million purchase of a 49% stake in electronics retailer Nguyen Kim, via its subsidiary Power Buy. Then in 2016, Central and Nguyen Kim acquired Vietnam's biggest foreign-owned supermarket chain Big C.Vietnam's tax authorities last year gave Big C Vietnam a tax bill of VND2 trillion (US$88 million) for its capital gains tax obligations after its former French owner Casino Group sold its stake to Central for 1 billion euros (US$1.14 billion).In 2015, authorities also collected VND1.9 trillion (US$85.6 million) in tax arrears from the US$700-million acquisition of Metro Vietnam.German-retailer Metro Cash & Carry, before being sold to Thailand’s TCC International Land, was accused of falsely reporting losses for 12 years in Vietnam and failing to pay tax bills worth US$23 million, according to the General Department of Taxation.Policy changes needed to boost rice sector’s growthDespite rapid growth for years, the rice sector of Vietnam is hamstrung by policies that reduce its competitiveness. Amidst this situation, strong actions are needed to broaden markets and increase rice exports.Analysing global market forecasts, Sergio Araujo from the Trade and Market Division of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) noted that global rice production mostly depended on higher productivity in Asia and Africa, which produced nearly 500 million tonnes in the 2015-2016 cropsCalculations showed that the world needs more than 50 million tonnes of additional rice. It is forecast that inventories in the future will be lower than production and demand, he said at a conference in Hanoi on May 24.He said that global rice trade will recover in 2025, but instability in policies and currency is likely to continue, adding that all predictions pointed to a slight fall in global rice inventory and declining rice prices. Currently, large rice producers face the problems of salinity and climate change.Experts also asserted that in Vietnam, small-scale production has led using many rice varieties leads to differences in quality and difficulties in tracking origin.Mechanisation levels in harvesting remain low, reducing rice export quality and raising post-harvest losses and production costs, they said, adding that current unsuitable processing procedures also affect quality.Commenting on the prospects for Vietnam’s rice sector in 2017, Pham Thi Kim Dung from the Institute of Policies and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development said the average rice price in 2017 may drop 2.7 percent over 2016 before increasing 6 percent in 2018.Dung said that Vietnam’s rice sector should focus on systemising, especially in trade intermediate and processing processes. Besides boosting exports, should also pay more attention to domestic market.Along with keeping a close eye on the Chinese market, it is necessary to maintain traditional markets and develop new ones, she added.Experts at the event also agreed that in the future, the local rice sector will encounter great challenges, requiring it to continue overcoming its weaknesses and design measures to respond to changes in the world rice market, while raising export revenue with high quality rice varieties and promoting trademark building.Local consumer trends changing significantlyA forum on “Vietnam’s consumer trend in 2017” was held in Hanoi on May 25 to discuss changes in consumption habits and how to promote the sustainable development of consumer goods in Vietnam.As the nation with the third largest population in Southeast Asia, about 70 per cent of whom are at working age, Vietnam has potential for consumer goods with significantly rising purchasing power.The forum was an opportunity for businesses in consumer goods, managers, economic researchers to exchange information. Participants also evaluated opportunities for Vietnamese consumer markets and discussed promoting consumption and market development, said Nguyen Van Nam, director of the Institute for Brand and Competitiveness Strategy (BCSI).The event covered various themes such as changes in consumer trends in Vietnam, internet shopping, brand positioning, consumers’ confidence in local goods and quality and cost of clean products.Chaitanya Kishore Reddy, research director of P&S – Mekong at the TNS Global market research company, said that consumption was changing in Vietnam due to improving living standards and lifestyle changes.Consumers want changes in packaging, as they want to see eye-catching products when they shop, he said.Consumers tend to prefer foreign brands to domestic ones, which has harmed local firms. Some 64 per cent of rice sold in Vietnam has a foreign name instead of a Vietnamese language name tag, with some Vietnamese firms using foreign languages to boost sales, reported Tran Nhat Tan, deputy head of Vibiz’s research department.Consumers also tend to focus on safe food and beverages which are good for health and “green” products that protect the environment.The seminar also discussed the effects of the fourth industrial revolution on consumption. By applying digital technology into consumption habits, people can save time by shopping online.Global market research firms predicted that in 2017-25, the number of online consumers in Vietnam would surge, with a diverse range of buyers and sellers.Therefore, enterprises should engage in high technology to introduce products to many online consumers in the era of technology development.The event was organised by BCSI in accordance with the Vietnam Economic Times (Thời báo Kinh tế Vietnam) newspaper.Saigon Autotech 2017 opens with added tweakSaigon International Autotech and Accessories 2017 continues to promote the development of Vietnam’s automobile and supporting industries to international partners.Running since 2006, Saigon Autotech and Accessories (Saigon Autotech) is the largest specialised exhibition of auto parts and accessories in Vietnam.

There are also special problems with transferring money to and from Vietnam to the Middle East, which complicate trade.The doing business in the Middle East seminar offered attendees some real commercial insights as well as some practical considerations for day to day operations and complying with local Middle East tax and regulatory laws and regulations.Can Tho develops high-quality large-scale fieldsDepartments, agencies and sectors of the Mekong Delta city of Ca Tho have been urged to focus on the implementation of measures to enhance the quality of large-scale fields.At a meeting to carry out the city’s large-scale field development plan to 2020 and orientation through 2025 on May 25, Vice Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Dao Anh Dung said there are 30 enterprises involving in implementing the large-scale field model in Can Tho, yet difficulties remain in the performance.According to the official, the city should put only 30,000 hectares of rice cultivation under the large-scale field model by 2020 to ensure the quality and sustainability.

The sector is expected to contribute 10 per cent to Vietnam’s GDP and become a key economic driver by 2020. By that time, the country is expected to welcome up to 20 million foreign visitors and earn $35 billion in tourism revenue.International Retail & Franchise Show 2017 set to openFollowing its success in previous years, the Vietnam International Retail & Franchise Show (VIETRF) in June will again be co-organized by the Korea International Trade Association (Kita), Coex Vietnam, the Association of Vietnam Retailers (AVR), and the Vietnam National Trade Fair and Advertising Company (Vinexad).The exhibition will be held from June 1 to 3 at the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Center (SECC) in Ho Chi Minh City’s District 7 and include exhibitions, an introduction to new products and services, a biz-matching program, seminars, and the final round of the Go Global Startup Competition 2017.All the needs of shopkeepers and owners of supermarkets, convenience stores, coffee shops, restaurants, fashion boutiques, and cosmetics stores will be met at the show.

Bamboo Capital said that it will collaborate with Ross Group in exploring investment opportunities in Vietnam, with focus on the areas of technology, infrastructure, energy and real estate. Specifically, Bamboo Capital will support the British group in building subsidiaries as well as executing investments in Vietnamese businesses. Electronics and energy will be picked as the first sectors to deploy the partnership, the Vietnamese firm said.
Launched in 1918, Ross Group has been specialising in the electronics industry, with offices in the US, Canada and Hong Kong. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange main board in 1973. Its principal operation of distributing consumer electronic products and supply chain management activities are performed by its wholly owned subsidiary, Sansui (UK) Ltd. Meanwhile, financial services for the company are predominately handled through the Hong Kong unit San Gain Ltd.
Bamboo Capital has just raised its charter capital to VND407 billion ($18.7 million) in March and was listed on July 16. The company’s shares closed Tuesday up at the ceiling price of VND17,100.
The Vietnamese financial service company was the consulting agency for two investments of the US-based Global Emerging Markets in multi-sector firms Duc Long Gia Lai Group (for a 20 per cent stake) and Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group (10 per cent) last year.
In April, Duc Long Gia Lai announced to sell all of its holdings in two affiliates to Bamboo Capital, including 91.71 per cent in Duc Long Gia Lai Wood Processing JSC and 19.5 per cent in Tay Nguyen Mineral and Metallurgy JSC, both at VND13,000 per share.
