      and Customer Diversification and Strengthens Product Portfolio

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CyrusOne Inc. (“CyrusOne”) (NASDAQ:CONE) announced today the signing of 
      a definitive agreement to acquire four data center facilities and two 
      work area recovery facilities (collectively, the “Facilities”) serving 
      the New York metropolitan area through the acquisition of Cervalis 
      Holdings LLC (“Cervalis”), a privately-held owner and operator of data 
      centers. When completed, the transaction will expand CyrusOne’s existing 
      portfolio to 31 data centers across 12 distinct markets (10 cities in 
      the U.S., London and Singapore).
    


      “We are really excited about this transaction and expect it to create 
      significant strategic opportunities for our customers and benefits to 
      our stockholders. I have known Mike Boccardi and Larry DeGeorge at 
      Cervalis for many years and have always admired the team they have 
      assembled and the financial services focused platform they have created 
      in the New York Metro area,” said Gary Wojtaszek, president and chief 
      executive officer of CyrusOne. “Their focus on serving the needs of the 
      largest financial enterprise customers in the world will be a valuable 
      complement to CyrusOne, and we look forward to working together to 
      continue to grow the combined business and create value for our 
      shareholders.”
    

      Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, a subsidiary of 
      CyrusOne will acquire Cervalis for approximately $400 million, excluding 
      transaction-related expenses, in an all cash transaction. 
      Simultaneously, CyrusOne has obtained financing commitments from KeyBank 
      and intends to finance the acquisition in a manner that takes into 
      consideration balance sheet flexibility, credit ratings impact and 
      accretion to shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the 
      next 45 to 60 days, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing 
      conditions.
    

Transaction Highlights


      When completed the transaction will add four Tier 3+ data center 
      facilities and two standalone work area recovery facilities serving the 
      New York metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s existing data center 
      platform. The Cervalis Facilities currently comprise more than 500,000 
      gross square feet of space, including more than 125,000 colocation 
      square feet and over 100,000 square feet of work area recovery space.
    

      “We have known CyrusOne and the management team for many years and are 
      glad that we will be able to join the companies together,” said Michael 
      Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of Cervalis. “The 
      combined strength will provide an opportunity to further accelerate the 
      success we have had in the financial services industry and provide our 
      existing customers the ability to grow outside of the New York 
      metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s global platform.”
    

      In 2014 Cervalis generated revenues of nearly $70 million, with 
      approximately two-thirds being derived from colocation services, and the 
      remainder from interconnection, managed services, and work area recovery 
      products. Over the last five years Cervalis has grown revenue at a 
      compound annual rate of approximately 14%. As of the end of 2014, 77% of 
      the colocation square feet within the Cervalis Facilities was utilized. 
      In addition to the currently available raised floor space, it currently 
      has capacity under shell to deliver an incremental 55,000 colocation 
      square feet.
    

      The transaction is expected to provide additional benefits to CyrusOne, 
      including the following:
    


Enhanced Geographic Diversification: The combination will 
        greatly enhance CyrusOne’s geographic diversification, establishing a 
        presence in the Northeast with the addition of a platform that 
        includes 4 data centers in the New York metropolitan market.
      

Access to a High Quality Enterprise Customer Base: Cervalis 
        serves approximately 220 enterprise customers, with a particular niche 
        servicing some of the world’s largest financial institutions, 
        including several Fortune 1000 companies. Approximately two-thirds of 
        its fourth quarter 2014 revenue came from customers within the 
        financial services industry.
      

Strengthened Product Portfolio: The transaction provides a set 
        of interconnected data centers in one of the world’s largest internet 
        hubs, further enhancing the attractiveness of CyrusOne’s National IX 
        platform. Access to a high-end managed services offering provides a 
        platform that can be selectively leveraged across CyrusOne’s existing 
        customer base to accelerate growth.
      


Financial Impact


      The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Normalized FFO per 
      diluted share and unit in the first year after completion. Additionally, 
      CyrusOne expects to increase utilization of the data centers which is 
      also expected to create additional long-term accretion. The Company will 
      provide updated guidance for the year subsequent to closing. Additional 
      details surrounding the transaction will be provided on CyrusOne’s first 
      quarter 2015 earnings call on Thursday, May 7.
    

Financial and Legal Advisors


      Morgan Stanley and Allen & Company LLC served as financial advisors to 
      CyrusOne, and DLA Piper served as CyrusOne’s legal advisor. DH Capital 
      served as the financial advisor to Cervalis and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw 
      Pittman served as Cervalis’ legal advisor.
    

Safe Harbor


      This release contains forward-looking statements regarding future events 
      and our future results that are subject to the "safe harbor" provisions 
      of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be 
      deemed forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current 
      expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries 
      in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. 
      Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "predicts," "projects," 
      "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," 
      "endeavors," "strives," "may," variations of such words and similar 
      expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In 
      addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future 
      financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our 
      businesses, and other characterizations of future events or 
      circumstances are forward-looking statements. Examples of 
      forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) 
      statements about the benefits of CyrusOne’s proposed acquisition of the 
      Facilities, including future financial and operating results, enhanced 
      utilization of the Facilities, expected cost savings, enhanced revenues 
      and accretion to reported earnings and funds from operations that may be 
      realized from the acquisition; (ii) statements of plans, objectives and 
      expectations of CyrusOne or its management, including the expected 
      timing of completion of the transaction; (iii) statements of future 
      economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such 
      statements and other statements that are not historical facts. Readers 
      are cautioned these forward-looking statements are based on current 
      expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially 
      and adversely from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. 
      Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, but are 
      not limited to: (i) the risk that CyrusOne and Cervalis may be unable to 
      obtain any governmental and regulatory approvals required for the 
      acquisition, or that any required governmental and regulatory approvals 
      may delay the acquisition or result in the imposition of conditions that 
      could cause the parties to abandon the acquisition; (ii) the risk that a 
      condition to closing of the acquisition may not be satisfied; (iii) the 
      time required to consummate the proposed acquisition; (iv) the risk that 
      the Facilities will not be integrated successfully or that such 
      integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than 
      expected; (v) the risk that the expected increased revenues, funds from 
      operations and net income may not be fully realized or may take longer 
      to realize than expected; (vi) the risk that the cost savings and any 
      other synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may 
      take longer to realize than expected; and (vii) disruption from the 
      transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with 
      customers, employees or suppliers. More information on potential risks 
      and uncertainties related to our business is available in our recent 
      filings with the SEC, including CyrusOne's Form 10-K report, Form 10-Q 
      reports, and Form 8-K reports. Actual results may differ materially and 
      adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We 
      undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking 
      statements for any reason.

Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

CyrusOne Stock Sees Short Interest Fall 36%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 02/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 2,658,977 share decrease in total short interest for CyrusOne Inc , to 4,752,203, a decrease of 35.88% since 02/15/2017.

CyrusOne specializes in highly reliable enterprise-class, carrier-neutral data center properties. The company provides mission-critical data center facilities that protect and ensure the continued operation of IT infrastructure for more than 500 customers, including nine of the Fortune 20 and more than 100 of the Fortune 1000 companies. CyrusOne's data center offerings provide the flexibility, reliability, and security that customers require and are delivered through a tailored, customer service-focused platform designed to foster long-term relationships. CyrusOne is committed to full transparency in communication, management, and service delivery throughout its 24 data centers worldwide.

Flexible Design 
CyrusOne will help you design a completely customized, flexible solution for your data center infrastructure. When you need to scale up, you can do so quickly.  Select low to very high density power solutions tailored to the rack level so you can choose the density and redundancy levels best suited to your needs – now and over time.  You easily move from a rack to a cage, a cage to a suite, or a suite to a data hall.


Full Transparency

Transparency means openness and clarity in all interactions. Receive transparency in communication, management, billing, and service delivery. You'll enjoy a delivery platform of industry best practices such as customer self-service, on-going reporting, and overall environment management to support SLA compliance. And, pricing models are customized for your specific solution and written in plain English.


High Reliability

At CyrusOne, data centers are engineered to deliver top-tier availability and you can depend on a 100% uptime SLA to back it up. All data centers are built with 2N redundancy of mechanical and electrical systems for a highly resilient environment.


The CyrusOne Meshed Design provides a much higher degree of resiliency with no single point of failure meaning the cooling or electrical systems can withstand a loss of two legs and still remain 100 percent operational. The distributed redundant electrical design allows for multiple levels of redundancy within the same data hall.

(“CyrusOne”) (NASDAQ:CONE) announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire four data center facilities and two work area recovery facilities (collectively, the “Facilities”) serving the New York metropolitan area through the acquisition of Cervalis Holdings LLC (“Cervalis”), a privately-held owner and operator of data centers. When completed, the transaction will expand CyrusOne’s existing portfolio to 31 data centers across 12 distinct markets (10 cities in the U.S., London and Singapore).“We are really excited about this transaction and expect it to create significant strategic opportunities for our customers and benefits to our stockholders. I have known Mike Boccardi and Larry DeGeorge at Cervalis for many years and have always admired the team they have assembled and the financial services focused platform they have created in the New York Metro area,” said Gary Wojtaszek, president and chief executive officer of CyrusOne. “Their focus on serving the needs of the largest financial enterprise customers in the world will be a valuable complement to CyrusOne, and we look forward to working together to continue to grow the combined business and create value for our shareholders.”Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, a subsidiary of CyrusOne will acquire Cervalis for approximately $400 million, excluding transaction-related expenses, in an all cash transaction. Simultaneously, CyrusOne has obtained financing commitments from KeyBank and intends to finance the acquisition in a manner that takes into consideration balance sheet flexibility, credit ratings impact and accretion to shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the next 45 to 60 days, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions.Transaction HighlightsWhen completed the transaction will add four Tier 3+ data center facilities and two standalone work area recovery facilities serving the New York metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s existing data center platform. The Cervalis Facilities currently comprise more than 500,000 gross square feet of space, including more than 125,000 colocation square feet and over 100,000 square feet of work area recovery space.“We have known CyrusOne and the management team for many years and are glad that we will be able to join the companies together,” said Michael Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of Cervalis. “The combined strength will provide an opportunity to further accelerate the success we have had in the financial services industry and provide our existing customers the ability to grow outside of the New York metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s global platform.”In 2014 Cervalis generated revenues of nearly $70 million, with approximately two-thirds being derived from colocation services, and the remainder from interconnection, enhanced services, and work area recovery products. Over the last five years Cervalis has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of approximately 14%. As of the end of 2014, 77% of the colocation square feet within the Cervalis Facilities was utilized. In addition to the currently available raised floor space, it currently has capacity under shell to deliver an incremental 55,000 colocation square feet.The transaction is expected to provide additional benefits to CyrusOne, including the following:Enhanced Geographic Diversification: The combination will greatly enhance CyrusOne’s geographic diversification, establishing a presence in the Northeast with the addition of a platform that includes 4 data centers in the New York metropolitan market.Access to a High Quality Enterprise Customer Base: Cervalis serves approximately 220 enterprise customers, with a particular niche servicing some of the world’s largest financial institutions, including several Fortune 1000 companies. Approximately two-thirds of its fourth quarter 2014 revenue came from customers within the financial services industry.Strengthened Product Portfolio: The transaction provides a set of interconnected data centers in one of the world’s largest internet hubs, further enhancing the attractiveness of CyrusOne’s National IX platform. Access to a high-end enhanced services offering provides a platform that can be selectively leveraged across CyrusOne’s existing customer base to accelerate growth.Financial ImpactThe acquisition is expected to be accretive to Normalized FFO per diluted share and unit in the first year after completion. Additionally, CyrusOne expects to increase utilization of the data centers which is also expected to create additional long-term accretion. The Company will provide updated guidance for the year subsequent to closing. Additional details surrounding the transaction will be provided on CyrusOne’s first quarter 2015 earnings call on Thursday, May 7.Financial and Legal AdvisorsMorgan Stanley and Allen & Company LLC served as financial advisors to CyrusOne, and DLA Piper served as CyrusOne’s legal advisor.
