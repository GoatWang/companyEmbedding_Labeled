(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions.  We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  Table of Contents  Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information concerning our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the SEC.  Overview  Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.  The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.  We believe that the demand for reasonably-priced medicines, delivered in the highest quality, and constantly matching the requirements of reliable and comprehensive medical care, is set to increase in the years to come, with the population's increasing life expectancy. With our product portfolio of non-patent and patent medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby to lowering costs both for health insurance funds and companies and for patients.  The Company for the period ended December 31, 2016 has recorded total revenues of $6,755,436 with costs of revenues of $6,154,396 and has incurred operating expenses of approximately $803,547 in connection with these operations. The Company and its subsidiary SkyPharm S.A., borrowed an aggregate $2,476,855 in loans as of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurance that we will ever raise the required capital necessary to effectuate our business plan; and even if we do, there is no assurance that we will ever commence or successfully develop this line of business.  The following significant events and transactions occurred during 2016 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:  On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with DOC Pharma SA, a company controlled by Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO, a director and principal shareholder. DOC Pharma SA located in Thessaloniki, Greece, is an ISO certified and licensed GDP (Good Distribution Practices) wholesaler of pharmaceutical products and GMP (Good Manufacture Practices) manufacturer of non-patent and patent medicines, Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and Food Supplements. It is the owner of numerous licenses of generic medicines and uses its own network of pharmaceutical sales representatives to communicate its products with doctors.  On October 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property Sale Agreement with Anastasios Tsekas and Olga Parthenea Georgatsou (the "IPSA") for the purchase of certain intellectual property rights relating to the proprietary Pharmaceutical Formula called "ProCure" that derives from a herb that is believed to be able to improve the prostate health and even possibly cure a prostate gland enlargement, infection, cancer, and other urinary problems. The Company received a compound along with a document that specifies the name of the herb that the Pharmaceutical Formula derives along with the related formula and compound, chemical identity and structure; know how, trade secret, methods and the procedures to produce a specified quantity of "ProCure".  On November 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Medihlem SPA") with Medihelm Pharmaceutical Wholesellers SA ("Medihlem"), Konstantinos Metsovitis (the "Medihelm Stockholder") and Eleni Metsovitis. The SPA provides for the following:  � At closing, as consideration for all of the stock of Medihelm, the Company shall issue the Medihelm Stockholder two hundred thousand (200,000) shares of restricted common stock of the Company.  � The Company also agreed that following the closing of the Medihelm SPA, Eleni Metsovitis would receive 3,100,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock and shall be retained as Medihelm's chief operating officer and director and shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company.  *  *  *  The closing of the Medihelm SPA is subject to, among other things, the completion of the Company's due diligence of Medihelm and the delivery of audited financial statements of Medihelm by a registered PCAOB auditor. The Medihelm SPA provides Medihelm with a period of forty-five (45) days to submit all due diligence items required by the Company. The Company shall be entitled to a period of ten (10) days to review all due diligence materials and audited financials provided by Medihelm. In the event the Company does not approve of any due diligence item, the Company is entitled to terminate the transactions contemplated by the Medihelm SPA. The Company anticipates that Medihelm will deliver disclosure schedules referenced in the Medihelm SPA prior to closing.  On November 17, 2016, Cosmos Holdings Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Decahedron SPA") with Decahedron Ltd. ("Decahedron") and the shareholders of Decahedron. The terms of the Decahedron SPA provided that the Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Decahedron. In exchange for the shares of Decahedron, the Company will issue to the Decahedron shareholders an aggregate amount of 1,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The Decahedron SPA provided that following the closing of the transaction, the principal and majority shareholder of Decahedron, Nicholas Lazarou would be retained as a Director and COO of Decahedron with a salary of 10,000 GBP per month (approximately US $12,270.00). The Company consummated this transaction on February 10, 2017.  On November 11, 2016, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the "CC Pharma MOU")with CC Pharma GmbH ("CCP"), Dr. Thomas Weppelmann ("Weppelmann") and Mrs. Alexandra Gerke ("Gerke" and together with Weppelmann, collectively referred to as (the "Stockholders"). The CC Pharma MOU provides that the Company intends to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of CCP from the Stockholders, payable in cash on a pro rata basis to the Stockholders based on their percentage ownership of CCP. The purchase price was not disclosed in the CC Pharma MOU and remains confidential. The CC Pharma MOU expires as of December 31, 2016. The consummation of the transactions with CCP and the Stockholders is subject to (i) the preparation and negotiation of final definitive agreements; and (ii) the Company's completion of satisfactory legal and tax due diligence with respect to CCP, including, but not limited to, the completion of audited financials of CCP by a PCAOB registered auditor. The Company makes no assurances that the parties will enter into definitive agreements prior to the expiration of the CC Pharma MOU or that the transactions with CCP will be consummated following the execution of the definitive agreements.  On November 18, 2016, the Board of Directors of Company appointed John J. Hoidas as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company has not yet entered into an agreement with Mr. Hoidas setting forth any compensation for the serves provided as a member of the Board.  Results of Operations  Year ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $601,002 on revenue of $6,775,436, versus a net loss of $6,687,912 on revenue of $533,802, for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Revenue  During the Company's twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, revenues increased by 1166% as compared to revenues in the period ended December 31, 2015. This variance to the prior year resulted mainly because of our subsidiary SkyPharm commenced the necessary capital in order to develop and expand its operations.  Operating Expenses  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we had direct costs of $6,154,396 associated with our products, general and administrative costs of $794,009 and depreciation expense of $9,448, for a net operating loss of $202,507, versus the year ended December 31, 2015, we had direct costs of $484,809 associated with our products, and general and administrative costs of $486,036 and depreciation expense of $5,416 for a net operating loss of $442,459.  The approximate 68% increase in operating expenses in the year ended 2016, against the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily due to the increasing operating resource needs of our subsidiary SkyPharm along with the costs of professional fees and other associated expenses in connection with being a public company, including related activity, as well as increased expenditures for potential company acquisitions. Consulting, auditing & accounting expenses consistently constitute the bulk of operating costs for the activities of the Company.  Table of Contents  Interest Expenses  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had interest expense of $206,014 of which $264 was interest related to loans from related parties versus the year ending December 31, 2015 where we had interest expense of $90,379, of which $3,481 was related to loan received from Dimitrios Goulielmos, the former Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company.  Unrealized Foreign Currency losses  Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency gain of $55,215 for the year ended December 31, 2016 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $545,787 versus the unrealized foreign currency losses of $424,713 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $7,112,625 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  Going Concern  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $601,002 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and had an accumulated deficit of $1,002,219 as of December 31, 2016. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.  In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $2,234,720 versus a working capital deficit of approximately $1,358,236 as of December 31, 2015. This change is attributed to the growth of the business of our subsidiary SkyPharm and the increased funding proceeds primarily by debt offerings that occurred within the year ended December 31, 2016.  At the end the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had net cash of $716,590 versus $198,049 as of December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $2,126,081 versus $497,089 net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to apply its investment program and incurred significant general and administrative expenses to enable it to finance and grow its business and operations.  During the twelve months period ended December 31, 2016, there was $144,716 net cash used in investing activities versus $43,952 used in during the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to the purchase of fixed assets by SkyPharm.  Table of Contents  During the twelve months period ended December 31, 2016, there was $2,744,179 of net cash provided by financing activities versus $329,122 provided by financing activities during the twelve months period ended December 31, 2015.  We believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of December 31, 2016 will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months. The Company will require additional financing in fiscal year 2017 in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, it may be forced to curtail its development activities.  We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of December 31, 2016, cash generated from the operations of the Company, from debt or equity financing, or from a loan from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets. Further, as a consequence we would fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.  Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months  Specifically, our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:  We are planning to develop our business through organic growth and at the same level through the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that would add value to our Company and its shareholders. Our organic growth would be driven by entering into a more profitable series of product in the pharmaceutical and over the counter segments. For our Subsidiary "SkyPharm S.A" we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across new European Market and entering into countries such as Denmark and Holland.  We are committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products. Thus, we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products. The Company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals, in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also.  Our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of our subsidiary, SkyPharm and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on branded pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generic pharmaceuticals, with plans to expand into cosmetic-beauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position.  We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses.  The Company, in the following twelve months, intends to start its operation within the markets of Generic pharmaceutical products, in Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food & Health Supplements. The specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance.  Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company's business.  Table of Contents  In addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets. We currently have focused our services to our customers throughout Europe. We plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the European Union market, although we currently have no binding agreements, commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets. Some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are: promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions, and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions. We anticipate that we will spend $45,000 evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding too. This cost is made of up primarily legal fees, consulting fees, accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses.  We expect to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products, product categories and channels, as well as through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital ("ROIC") in excess of 300 basis points over our weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC").  As to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector, SEC filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations, including any acquired business. So we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a company if we were to acquire them. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $80,000 to locate, conduct due diligence, and evaluate possible acquisitions. As noted above, as of the date of this report, we do not have any binding agreements, commitments, or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates.  We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the European trade market of medicines, if service, price and quality are strictly directed to-wards the customer requirements. We will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service, reliability and a high level of quality. On the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply Europe wide. We secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management.  Over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs.  We still see the risks for the future development in a difficult and competitive environment, increasing purchase prices and the stagnating selling price level. On the background of our financial stability we however see ourselves as being well-equipped for managing the future risks. Risks that could endanger the survival of the Company are currently not able to be identified.  We will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, we remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.  Significant Equipment  We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment for the next twelve months aside from a few pieces of IT equipment. Nevertheless, we will replace essential equipment for operations if it is required within the year.  Employees  In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. We have plans to increase the number of our employees by adding more sales people during the next twelve months.  Table of Contents  Revenue Recognition  We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.  Our records at December 31, 2016 have been sufficient to satisfy all of the four requirements. Revenue has been recognized for all amounts billed prior to December 31, 2016, all of which were in respect of services rendered during December 2016 or prior to January 2017.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most "critical accounting polices" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Foreign Currency. The Company requires translation of the Amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse take-over on September 27, 2013. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.  Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC  The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus and Greece. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and 29%, respectively and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.  We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not . . .

Cosmos Holdings, Inc. Announces Full-Year 2016 Results

Revenue Improved 1,166 Percent and Gross Profit Improved 1,126 Percent Year over Year

CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Apr 19, 2017) -  Cosmos Holdings, Inc. ("the Company") (OTCQB: COSM), an international pharmaceutical company, announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, versus the year ended December 31, 2015, Cosmos Holdings' revenue improved 1,166 percent to $6.8 million from $0.5 million on the strength of its SkyPharm SA subsidiary, which obtained the necessary capital during 2016 in order to develop and expand and organically grow its operations. Of note, revenue improved sequentially 117 percent, from $1.4 million in the 2016 third quarter to $3.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter due to the organic growth in Sky Pharm SA. Additionally, gross profit increased 1,126 percent to $0.6 million in 2016 from $48,993 in 2015. Net loss of $0.6 million in 2016 was reduced dramatically from $6.8 million in 2015 due to the strong growth in the Company's revenue.
During 2016 Cosmos Holdings reduced its customer concentration risk. In 2015 the Company's top three customers comprised 87 percent of its total sales compared to only 56 percent for 2016. Additionally, the Company successfully expanded its geographic market from four countries in 2015 to eight countries in 2016.
Cosmos Holdings CEO Gregory Siokas commented, "While we are gratified by the great improvement in our financial results in 2016 over 2015, we believe we have tremendous opportunity for continued growth and improvement. In 2017, we are planning to develop and grow our business through the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that will add value to our Company and its shareholders. Specifically, we are looking to enter more profitable pharmaceutical and over-the-counter segments and expand our product pipeline to include generic and cosmetics products. Additionally, at SkyPharm S.A, we are committed to increasing our customer pipeline by entering new countries, such as Denmark and Holland, while also pursuing alliances, licenses and joint ventures, and targeting markets where we can build and maintain a strong position." 
Cosmos Holdings was successful in securing $2.6 million of institutional capital until the end of the first quarter of 2017. The company also entered into an agreement for an additional EUR 2,750,000 of capital through its subsidiary Decahedron in the form of a trade facility in April 2017.

	The terms "COSM," "we," "the Company," and "us" as used in this report refer to Cosmos Holdings Inc. The accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 and unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management of COSM, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017, or any other period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the two years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements filed in our Form 10-K and is included for comparison purposes in the accompanying balance sheet. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.


	 



	NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS



	 


	Cosmos Holdings, Inc. ("Cosmos", "The Company", "we", or "us") was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. on July 21, 2009 for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets.


	 


	On September 27, 2013 (the "Closing"), Cosmos Holding Inc. a Nevada corporation ("Cosmos Holdings, Inc." or the "Registrant"), closed a reverse take-over transaction by which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various sectors. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") between the Registrant and Amplerissimo Ltd, a company incorporated in Cyprus ("Amplerissimo"), the Registrant acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock.


	 


	On August 1, 2014, we, through our Cypriot subsidiary Amplerissimo, formed SkyPharm S.A. a Greek Corporation ("SkyPharm") whose principal activities and operations are the development, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical, wellness and cosmetic products.


	 


	On February 10, 2017, the Company and Decahedron Ltd, a UK Corporation (“Decahedron”) consummated the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 17, 2017. as amended (the “Decahedron SPA”).. Pursuant to the terms of the Decahedron SPA, the shareholders of Decahedron received an aggregate of 1,700,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Stock Consideration”), which were delivered following the closing in exchange for all of the Ordinary Shares of Decahedron for the Stock Consideration. In accordance with the terms of the SPA, Mr. Lazarou remained as a director and officer of Decahedron with a salary of GBP £10,000 per month (approximately US $12,270).


	 


	We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and our new subsidiary Decahedron, we have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and we target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as Research & Development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value.

	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products. To compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic categories, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.


	 


	We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of branded pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical companies in areas that will serve patients that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition opportunities.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company generated a net loss of $2,033,734 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and has a working capital deficit of $2,913,255 and an accumulated deficit of $3,035,953 as of March 31, 2017. These conditions raise substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company maintains bank accounts in the United States denominated in U.S. Dollars and in the Republic of Cyprus, in Greece and in Bulgaria all of them denominated in Euros. The Company also maintains bank accounts in the United Kingdom of Great Britain, dominated in Euros and Great Britain Pound (British Pounds Sterling).


	 



	Account Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information.


	 



	Inventory



	 


	Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted average method. Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials, i.e. packaged pharmaceutical products and the wrappers and containers they are sold in. A periodic inventory system is maintained by 100% count. Inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment.


	 


	We write-down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions, which may differ from actual results.

	Fixed Assets



	 


	Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives (except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life) of the assets as follows:

	Intangible Assets



	 


	Intangible assets with definite useful lives are recorded on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company uses a useful life of 5 years for an import/export license. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. If the estimate of the intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. At March 31, 2017, no revision to the remaining amortization period of the intangible assets was made.


	 


	Amortization expense was $1,974 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	In accordance with ASC 360-10, Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.


	 



	Goodwill and Intangibles



	 


	The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization, including goodwill, to determine whether impairment may exist. Goodwill and certain intangible assets are assessed annually, or when certain triggering events occur, for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. These events could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, a decline in operating performance, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company uses level 3 inputs and a discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. A discounted cash flow analysis requires one to make various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the Company’s budget and long-term plans. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.


	 


	Prior to the acquisition of Decahedron, the Company had no record goodwill value. As a result of the acquisition of Decahedron, the Company tested and expensed 100% of the goodwill allocated to the acquisition costs, an amount equal to $1,949,884 for the period ending March 31, 2017.

	Fair Value Measurement



	 


	The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:


	 


	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


	 


	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.


	 


	Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.


	 


	The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2017.


	 


	Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of March 31, 2017 and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.


	 


	In addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option, or ASC 825-10-25, was effective for January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.


	 



	Stock-based Compensation



	 


	The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with ASC section 718, "Stock Compensation" and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB 107) issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation of ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period. The Company values any employee or non-employee stock based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.

	The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50 "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees".


	 



	Foreign Currency Translations and Transactions



	 


	Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated.


	 


	Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net earnings.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus and Greece. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and 29% in Greece and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At March 31, 2017 the Company has maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.


	 


	We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. As of March 31, 2017 the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. The per share amounts include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income. Basic and diluted loss per share for each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is the same due to the anti-dilutive nature of potential common stock equivalents.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of the revenue standard issued in 2014, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In response to stakeholders' requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements, the FASB proposed deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral. Respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is critical to its success.


	 


	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability. This ASU is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the current goodwill impairment test in the event that there is evidence of an impairment based on qualitative or quantitative assessments. ASU 2017-04 does not change how the goodwill impairment is identified, and the Company will continue to perform a qualitative assessment annually to determine whether the two step impairment test is required. Until the adoption, current accounting standards require the impairment loss to be recognized under Step 2 of the impairment test. This requires the Company to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit has been acquired in a business combination, then subsequently subtracting the implied goodwill from the carrying amount of the goodwill. The new standard would require the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and subtract the carrying value from the fair value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment. ASU 2017-04 is effective for the Company for fiscal years after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2017-04 is required to be adopted prospectively, and the adoption is effective for annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the year of adoption. The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU No. 2017-4 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or the Company’s consolidated results of operations


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or a business. ASU No. 2017-01 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2018. The effect of this guidance is to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or the Company’s consolidated results of operations


	 


	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 3. ACQUISITION OF DECAHEDRON, LTD.



	 


	On February 10, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition Decahedron pursuant to the Decahedron SPA acquiring 100% of the outstanding shares of Decahedron, a United Kingdom Company, a pharmaceuticals wholesaler which specializes in imports and exports of branded and generic pharmaceutical products within the EEA and around the world. At closing, the Company acquired 100% of Decahedron’s outstanding shares in exchange for 1,700,000 shares of Cosmos common stock valued at $1,479,000 (the "Acquisition").

	The Company recognized the Decahedron assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair value of such assets and liabilities measured as of the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price for Decahedron has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the license held by Decahedron for the wholesale of pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdome and Europe, the remainder has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.


	 


	During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we recorded an adjustment of $28,002 primarily related to other assets and an adjustment of the accounts payable associated with the Decahedron acquisition. We finalized our allocation of purchase price during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The final unaudited allocation of purchase price as of March 31, 2017, is as follows:

	The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by $1,949,884 which was recorded as Goodwill. Goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price for the net assets purchased from Decahedron and the aggregate fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. At the conclusion of the acquisition, goodwill was reviewed for impairment and it was determined that indicators of impairment existed.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, after our assessment of the totality of the events that could impair goodwill, it was the Company’s conclusion “it is not more likely than not” that the Goodwill was impaired. Therefore, the Company was not required to conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. No events have occurred after March 31, 2017 that would affect the Company’s conclusion as of the March 31, 2017 assessment date. As a result of the Company’s assessment, 100% of the goodwill of $1,949,884 was recorded as an impairment of goodwill.

	On February 28, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Synthesis Management Limited (“Synthesis Management”) to loan €125,000 ($133,725) to Synthesis Management for the purpose of paying a financing management fee. The Company made the payment to Synthesis Management on September 28, 2016. The loan is non-interest bearing and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016.

	NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES



	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings taxed at the lower income tax rate in Cyprus.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At March 31, 2017, the Company has a maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax. The Company has recorded $20,811 of interest and penalties as interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 in accordance with this policy.

	Overview



	 


	Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.


	 


	The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.


	 


	We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and our other subsidiaries, and have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and we will target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as research & development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities.

	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $2,033,734 on revenue of $4,115,916, versus a net loss of $69,106 ono revenue of $1,136,406 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.

	The Company had revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $4,115,916, versus revenue of $1,136,406 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase is mainly because of the organic growth attributed to our subsidiary, SkyPharm, which continued even more aggressively during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as well as through the additional revenue sources from our new subsidiary, Decahedron.

	Total operating expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 were $2,348,520, versus $128,691 during the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses in the three month period in 2017, against the corresponding period in 2016, is primarily due to the result of the Company’s assessment, 100% of the goodwill of $1,949,884 was recorded as an impairment of goodwill.

	Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency loss of $15,019 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $2,048,753 versus the unrealized foreign currency loss of $212,853 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $281,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,913,255 and $2,234,720 as of December 31, 2016. This increase in the working capital deficit is attributed to the impairment of goodwill of $1,949,884 that was recorded for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $397,306 versus $716,590 as of December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $658,546 versus $82,845 net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The variation use of cash is mainly attributed to the loss on goodwill of $1,949,884 that was recorded for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.

	During the three month period ended March 31, 2017, there was $36,886 net cash provided by investing activities versus $7,945 used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase in net cash from investing activities is attributed mainly to the cash received from the acquisition of Decahedron that took place within the three month period ended March 31, 2017


	 


	During the three month period ended March 31, 2017, there was $334,556 of net cash provided by financing activities versus $199,426 provided by financing activities during the three month period ended March 31, 2016. This variation was primarily because of the increase in financing activities of our subsidiary SkyPharm.


	 


	We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of March 31, 2017, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiary and from debt or equity financing, or from a loan from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets. Further, as a consequence we may fail to satisfy our reporting obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.


	 



	Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months



	 


	Specifically, our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:


	 


	We are planning to develop our business through organic growth and at the same level through the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that would add value to our Company and its shareholders. Our organic growth would be driven by entering into a more profitable series of product in the pharmaceutical and over the counter segments. For our Subsidiary "SkyPharm S.A" we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across new European Market and entering into countries such as Denmark and Holland.


	 


	We are also committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products. Thus, we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products. The Company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals, in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also.


	 


	Our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of SkyPharm and our new subsidiary, Decahedron, in connection with and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on branded pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generic pharmaceuticals, with plans to expand into cosmetic-beauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position.


	 


	Through our new subsidiary, Decahedron, we plan to penetrate into the English pharmaceutical market and expand our wholesale networks. We could utilize the ability of trading pharmaceutical products in and out of the English market according to the FX currency exchange rate of euro to English pounds.

	We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses.


	 


	The Company, in the following twelve months, intends to start its operation within the markets of Generic pharmaceutical products, in Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food & Health Supplements. The specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance.


	 


	Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company's business.


	 


	In addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets. We currently have focused our services to our customers throughout Europe. We plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the European Union market, although we currently have no binding agreements, commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets. Some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are: promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions, and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions. We anticipate that we will spend $45,000 evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding too. This cost is made of up primarily legal fees, consulting fees, accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses.


	 


	We expect to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products, product categories and channels, as well as through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital ("ROIC") in excess of 300 basis points over our weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC").


	 


	As to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector, SEC filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations, including any acquired business. So we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a target company if we were to acquire them. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $80,000 to locate, conduct due diligence, and evaluate possible acquisitions. Except as described above in connection with Medihelm, as of the date of this report, we do not have any binding agreements, commitments, or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates.


	 


	We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the European trade market of medicines, if service, price and quality are strictly directed to-wards the customer requirements. We will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service, reliability and a high level of quality. On the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply Europe wide. We secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management.


	 


	Over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs.


	 


	We still see the risks for the future development in a difficult and competitive environment, increasing purchase prices and the stagnating selling price level. On the background of our financial stability we however see ourselves as being well-equipped for managing the future risks. Risks that could endanger the survival of the Company are currently not able to be identified.

	We will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, we remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.




	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	As of March 31, 2017 there were no off balance sheet arrangements.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most "critical accounting polices" in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.


	 



	Foreign Currency.

	The Company requires translation of the Amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse take-over on September 27, 2013. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.


	 



	Income Taxes.

	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.


	 


	We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.

	We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.


	 


	Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 "Accounting for Income Taxes" as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.


	 


	The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings, Inc. which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.


	 



	Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting



	 


	During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Cosmos Holdings, Inc. Announces first Quarter 2017 Results

Revenue Improved 362% and Gross Profit Improved 415% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016

CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - May 23, 2017) -  Cosmos Holdings, Inc. ("the Company") (OTCQB: COSM), an international pharmaceutical company, announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, versus the quarter ended March 31, 2016, Cosmos Holdings' revenue improved 362% to $4.1 million from $1.1 million on the strength of its SkyPharm SA subsidiary, which obtained the necessary capital during 2016 and 2017 in order to develop, expand and organically grow its operations. Of note, revenue improved sequentially 27%, from $3.2 million in the 2016 fourth quarter to $4.1 million in the 2017 first quarter due to the organic growth in Sky Pharm SA and the acquisition of the UK subsidiary Decahedron Ltd. Additionally, gross profit increased 415% to $363,692 in the first quarter of 2017 from $87,676 in the first quarter of 2016. 
During the first quarter of 2017 Cosmos Holdings completed the acquisition of the UK based pharmaceutical company Decahedron Ltd. With this acquisition, Cosmos expands its geographic market improving its access to additional vendors and customers moving closer to its goal of becoming an International Pharmaceutical Company.
Cosmos Holdings was successful in securing $2.6 million of institutional capital as of the first quarter of 2017. The company also entered into an agreement for an additional 2,750,000 EUR of capital through its subsidiary Decahedron in the form of a trade facility in April 2017. Moreover, in May 12, 2017 the company entered into another trade finance agreement and received institutional financing of 2,000,000 EUR through its subsidiary Skypharm SA.
Cosmos Holdings CEO Gregory Siokas commented, "In the first quarter of 2017 we successfully completed the strategic acquisition of Decahedron Ltd, expanding our reach to the UK market. Currently we are working hard to accelerate the growth of our subsidiaries and moving forward with the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that will add value to the Company and its shareholders. During 2017 we are planning to complete additional acquisitions, continue to enter into new markets, and expand our product lines to include generic drugs and cosmetics products."

	NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	The terms "COSM," "we," "the Company," and "us" as used in this report refer to Cosmos Holdings Inc. The accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management of COSM, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the two years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements filed in our Form 10-K and is included for comparison purposes in the accompanying balance sheet. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.


	 



	NOTE 2 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS



	 


	Cosmos Holdings, Inc. ("Cosmos", "the Company", the "Registrant", "we", or "us") was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. on July 21, 2009 for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets.


	 


	On September 27, 2013 (the "Closing"), the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction by which it acquired a private company, Amplerissimo Ltd (“Amplerissimo”). Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") between the Registrant and Amplerissimo, a company incorporated in Cyprus, the Registrant acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock.


	 


	On August 1, 2014, we, through our Cypriot subsidiary Amplerissimo, formed SkyPharm S.A. a Greek corporation ("SkyPharm") whose principal activities and operations are the development, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical, over the counter, and cosmetic products.


	 


	The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both of the branded pharmaceutical market and generic pharmaceutical products market. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products. To compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic categories, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.


	 


	We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of pharmaceutical products and companies in areas that will serve patients that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter (“OTC”) product lines by acquiring or licensing rights and regularly evaluate selective acquisition opportunities.

	Going Concern



	 


	The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a total net loss of $277,797 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and has an accumulated deficit of $679,014 and a working capital deficit of $1,736,375 as of September 30, 2016, the Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product, by sale of common shares and debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Basis of Financial Statement Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	Our consolidated accounts include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Amplerissimo Ltd and SkyPharm S.A. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company maintains bank accounts in the United States denominated in U.S. Dollars and in the Republic of Cyprus, in Greece and in Bulgaria all of them denominated in Euros.


	 



	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information.

	Inventory



	 


	Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted average method. Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials, i.e. packaged pharmaceutical products and the wrappers and containers they are sold in. A periodic inventory system is maintained by 100% count. Inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment.


	 


	We write-down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions, which may differ from actual results.


	 



	Fixed Assets



	 


	Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives (except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life) of the assets as follows:

	Depreciation expense was $6,956 and $6,996 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.


	 



	Fair Value Measurement



	 


	The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:


	 


	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


	 


	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.


	 


	Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.


	 


	The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016.


	 


	Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of September 30, 2016, and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.


	 


	In addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option, or ASC 825-10-25, was effective for January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.

	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.


	 



	Stock-based Compensation



	 


	The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with ASC section 718, "Stock Compensation" and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB 107) issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation of ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period. The Company values any employee or non-employee stock based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.


	 


	The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50 "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees".


	 



	Foreign Currency Translations and Transactions



	 


	Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated.


	 


	Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net earnings.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus and Greece. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and 29% in Greece and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2016 the Company has maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.


	 


	We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax.

	Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. The per share amounts include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income. Basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the same due to the anti-dilutive nature of potential common stock equivalents.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of the revenue standard issued in 2014, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In response to stakeholders' requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements, the FASB proposed deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral. Respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is critical to its success.


	 


	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability. This ASU is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.


	 


	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES



	 


	At September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings taxed at the lower income tax rate in Cyprus.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2016 the Company has a maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.


	 


	As of September 30, 2016 the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax. The Company has recorded $65,368 of interest and penalties as interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in accordance with this policy.

	On November 4, 2015, Mr. Dimitrios Goulielmos (the "Seller") and Mr. Grigorios Siokas (the "Buyer") entered into a stock purchase agreement, whereby Mr. Goulielmos sold 95,000,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Siokas for $1.00. As part of the agreement, the Seller forgave and released the Company and the Company's subsidiary from all claims except for the repayment of €200,000 that was loaned by the Seller to SkyPharm.

	Overview



	 


	Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.


	 


	The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.


	 


	We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and we target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as research & development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities.

	During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company leased and equipped additional office space for our subsidiary SkyPharm in Thessaloniki, Greece in order to facilitate its growing business activity. The warehouse was already equipped with the proper shelves, working tables, medicine, cold fridge and barcode machines in compliance with all regulations. The offices in Thessaloniki have been also equipped with the proper equipment and specifically with the office tables, chairs and the terminals for each one working station. The hardware systems and software programs that are needed for the efficient trading of pharmaceuticals are already installed. As of July 22, 2015 the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to SkyPharm. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use. The Company has already incorporated the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices.


	 


	On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc.Pharma SA to purchase Doc.Pharma SA for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc.Pharma SA is controlled by Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO. The Memorandum of Understanding is subject to the Company's completion of due diligence and expires on December 31, 2016. We currently have no binding agreements, commitments, contracts or new cooperative agreements for the acquisition of other existing companies, except with respect to the Memoranda of Understanding described in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.


	 


	The Company, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, has recorded total revenues of $3,506,804 and has incurred expenses of approximately $3,192,472 in connection with these proposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will ever raise the required capital necessary to effectuate our business plan; and even if we do, there is no assurance that we will ever commence or successfully develop this line of business.

	Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015



	 


	For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $94,613 on revenue of $1,414,503, versus a net loss of $100,390 with no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015.


	 



	Revenue



	 


	The Company had revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,414,503, versus no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to our subsidiary SkyPharm commencing its operations and sales at the end of 2015, and continued even more aggressively during the three months ended September 30, 2016.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $175,919, versus $75,152 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The approximate 134% increase in operating expenses in the three month period in 2016, against the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily due to the increased costs of business operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm including, but not limited to, the related payroll expenses, costs of professional fees, consulting expenses and other associated expenses in connection with being a public company.


	 



	Unrealized Foreign Currency losses



	 


	Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency loss of $16,622 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $111,235 versus the unrealized foreign currency gain of $55,764 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $44,626 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

	Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015



	 


	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $277,024 on revenue of $3,506,804, versus a net loss of $341,663 with no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.


	 



	Revenue



	 


	The Company had revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $3,506,804, versus no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Company's nine month period ended September 30, 2016, revenues increased by 100% as compared to no revenues in the period ended September 30, 2015. This variation was due to the fact that our subsidiary SkyPharm commenced its operations and sales at the end of 2015, and continued even more aggressively during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were $473,249 versus $269,237 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The approximate 76% increase in operating expenses in the nine month period in 2016, against the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily due to the increase of business operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm, including, but not limited to, the related payroll expenses, costs of professional fees, consulting expenses and other associated expenses in connection with being a public company.


	 



	Unrealized Foreign Currency losses



	 


	Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency loss of $38,185 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $315,982 versus the unrealized foreign currency losses of $394,148 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $735,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,736,375 and approximately $1,358,236 as of December 31, 2015. This increase in the working capital deficit is attributed to the increase of notes payable due to the growing needs to fund the operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm.


	 


	At the end the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $619,773 versus $198,049 as of December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $1,235,021 versus $329,598 net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increased use of cash is mainly attributed to the growing needs to fund the operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm.


	 


	During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there was $152,355 net cash used in investing activities versus $34,397 used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to the increase in loan receivables by our subsidiary SkyPharm.


	 


	During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there was $1,770,723 of net cash provided by financing activities versus $117,000 provided by financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in financing activities of our subsidiary SkyPharm.

	We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of September 30, 2016, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiary and from debt or equity financing, or from a loan from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets. Further, as a consequence we would fail to satisfy our reporting obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.


	 



	Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months



	 


	Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:


	 


	For our Subsidiary "SkyPharm S.A" we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across the new European Market and entering into countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Holland.


	 


	We are committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products. Thus, we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products. The Company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals, in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also.


	 


	Our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of our subsidiary, SkyPharm and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on branded pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generic pharmaceuticals, with plans to expand into cosmetic-beauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position.


	 


	We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses.


	 


	The Company, in the following twelve months, intends to launch its operations within the markets of Generic pharmaceutical products, in Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food & Health Supplements. The specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance.


	 


	Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company's business.

	In addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets. We currently have focused our efforts to our customers throughout Europe. We plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the European Union market. Some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are: promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions, and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $45,000 evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding to. This cost is made of up primarily legal fees, consulting fees, accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses.


	 


	We have to continue market our products directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare professionals. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other pharmaceutical companies, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. We believe this corporate strategy will allow us to maximize both the growth rate and profitability of the Company and at the same time to enhance shareholder value.


	 


	As to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector, SEC filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations, including any acquired business. So we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a company if we were to acquire them. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $50,000 to locate, conduct due diligence, and evaluate target companies for possible acquisitions. As noted above, as of the date of this Report, we do not have any binding agreements, commitments, or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates, except for the MOU’s as described in the footnotes to the financials and in the “Subsequent Event” in Part II below.


	 


	On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc.Pharma SA to purchase Doc.Pharma SA for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc.Pharma SA is controlled by Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO. The Memorandum of Understanding is subject to the Company's completion of due diligence and expires on December 31, 2016.


	 


	In connection with Amplerissimo, we plan on continuing to offer the same products and services through Amplerissimo which include: data mining, statistical data analysis, research and analysis, negotiating services, credit risk analysis, credit management, conducting case studies, introduction services, e-commerce consulting, marketing management consulting, expansion strategies consulting, information systems consulting, and business management software consulting.


	 


	We will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, we remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	As of September 30, 2016 there were no off balance sheet arrangements.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most "critical accounting polices" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

	Foreign Currency.

	The Company requires translation of the Amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse take-over on September 27, 2013. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.


	 



	Income Taxes.

	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.


	 


	We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.


	 


	We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.


	 


	We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.


	 


	Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 "Accounting for Income Taxes" as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.


	 


	The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings, Inc. which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus.
