The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Would you like to add an extra touch of beauty with an enamel finish? Or do you want to add colour and shine to your cast iron? Look no further than our enamelling facilities. Like a good wine, our enamellists have improved their craftsmanship over time. With two application lines and two tunnel furnaces at your service, you can rely on high-quality enamelling and glaze coating. Thanks to our follow-up tests for tint and hue, uniform layer thickness, hardness and surface roughness, you can rest assured your enamel coating will be nothing but the best. Let’s agree on which colour best suits your design.

Technical tests

Your enamel is thoroughly tested for:

Surface roughness.
Layer thickness.
Enamel hardness.
Colour, with computer-based spectrometer testing.
 



 






Packaging& Shipping

						Packaging& Shipping					



 Fully assembled and virtually glowing with a top-quality enamel finish, your product looks as good as you dreamt it would. Make sure it stays this way. With proper packaging you can protect your cast iron from scratches, impact and other forms of damage. And not just when it’s being shipped and handled. We know how important it is to have an item packaged correctly when you need to store it in your warehouse or stock room.


Of course you need to get your order there first. We will gladly arrange the shipping or delivery of your order. Just let us know the address and we will make sure it’s there on time. And when we say on time, we mean on time. If you’re a little short on space? No problem. Just ask us to store your order until you’re ready for it. It would be our pleasure.
 



 






Quality Standards

						Quality Standards					



Our highly-trained, experienced and reliable team know the ins and outs not just of the equipment in our foundry. They don’t just know what we are capable of as a foundry: they know exactly what can be accomplished with cast iron, and more importantly, they know how to accomplish it.


We always aim for the absolute highest quality. You are welcome and encouraged to take part in the engineering process with our guidance and supervision. Every decision you make is analysed and enhanced to produce a stronger, higher quality product before your pattern plates are made. And after casting? Your product is tested and examined for accuracy, metal quality, strength, durability, hardness and even smoothness. Because a product is not of high enough quality if it doesn’t meet the standards we demand.
