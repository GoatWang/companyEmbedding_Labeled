 Seaweed organic fertilizer is produced by seaweed residue with biological fermentation technology. It is rich in several ocean active elements, such as seaweed polysaccharide, alginic acid, highly unsaturated fatty acid, phycophaein, fucoidin. And also it contains some natural growth regulating substances, such as cytokinin, gibbberellin, mannitol, betaine, polyphenols, especially some rare microelements, such as iodine, zinc, nickel, magnesium and some beneficial bacterium and natural antibiotics.
This kind of seaweed fertilizer is good for increasing soil organic matter, improving soil structure, enhancing abilities of preserving moisture and fertility, raising heat and permeability, improving nutrient environment for crop, and the effectiveness of fertilizer and soil structure. It can also improve the growth of crops in each stage, such as sprout rate, root vigor-stimulated, improving the growth of stem and leaves, enhancing water-logging-enduring ability. Improving the production quality, increasing yields, reducing pollution and protecting environment are advantages of this fertilizer as well.

This is peat of a product that replaces 100% a chicken manure or bed.
What happens and the following the manufacturer for rural opta chicken bed because of this product humic acid, fulvic acid.
What most of producers and do not know the greatest concentration of such nutrients in this leonardite australian and press that of titanium fh matter what liquid fertilizer organic-class a, acid concentrated source humic and fulvic, acid derivatives australian leonardite humic 18% , fulvic acid 3% for via solo, innovative product with nano technology particles that facilitate the action and immediate absorption of nutrients by plant root. The peat and titanium fh 300 times more concentrated the bed of chicken it age in time. Unlike bed chicken that takes 2 to 4 months to release the humic acid and fulvic the acid and has more mr know that chicken brings bed diseases and fungi for plant and then humic acid and fulvic the acid released the bed of chicken disperses. Now the peat titanium fh will act for one year and the soil releasing for the plant fibrous root all match that held this ground and also will decrease the loss of leaching.
