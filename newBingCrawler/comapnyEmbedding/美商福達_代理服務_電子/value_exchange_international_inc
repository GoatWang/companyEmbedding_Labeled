It does not include securities convertible into the common equity securities. “Market Capitalization” is derived from the last sale price for the displayed class of listed securities and the total number of shares outstanding for both listed and unlisted securities (as applicable). NASDAQ does not use this value to determine compliance with the listing requirements.

Value in marketing, also known as customer-perceived value, is the difference between a prospective customer's evaluation of the benefits and costs of one product when compared with others. Value may also be expressed as a straightforward relationship between perceived benefits and perceived costs: Value = Benefits / Cost.
The basic underlying concept of value in marketing is human needs. The basic human needs may include food, shelter, belonging, love, and self expression. Both culture and individual personality shape human needs in what is known as wants. When wants are backed by buying power, they become demands.
With a consumers' wants and resources (financial ability), they demand products and services with benefits that add up to the most value and satisfaction.
The four types of value include: functional value, monetary value, social value, and psychological value. The sources of value are not equally important to all consumers. How important a value is, depends on the consumer and the purchase. Values should always be defined through the "eyes" of the consumer.
Functional Value: This type of value is what an offer does, it's the solution an offer provides to the customer.
Monetary Value: This is where the function of the price paid is relative to an offerings perceived worth. This value invites a trade-off between other values and monetary costs.
Social Value: The extent to which owning a product or engaging in a service allows the consumer to connect with others.
Psychological Value: The extent to which a product allows consumers to express themselves or feel better.
For a firm to deliver value to its customers, they must consider what is known as the "total market offering." This includes the reputation of the organization, staff representation, product benefits, and technological characteristics as compared to competitors' market offerings and prices. Value can thus be defined as the relationship of a firm's market offerings to those of its competitors.
Value in marketing can be defined by both qualitative and quantitative measures. On the qualitative side, value is the perceived gain composed of individual's emotional, mental and physical condition plus various social, economic, cultural and environmental factors. On the quantitative side, value is the actual gain measured in terms of financial numbers, percentages, and dollars.
For an organization to deliver value, it has to improve its value : cost ratio. When an organization delivers high value at high price, the perceived value may be low. When it delivers high value at low price, the perceived value may be high. The key to deliver high perceived value is attaching value to each of the individuals or organizations—making them believe that what you are offering is beyond expectation—helping them to solve a problem, offering a solution, giving results, and making them happy.
Value changes based on time, place and people in relation to changing environmental factors. It is a creative energy exchange between people and organizations in our marketplace.
Very often managers conduct customer value analysis to reveal the company's strengths and weaknesses compared to other competitors. the steps of which are as followed.

To identify the major attributes and benefits that customers value for choosing a product and vendor.
Assessment of the quantitative importance of the different attributes and benefits.
Assessment of the company's and competitors' performance on each attribute and benefits.
Examining how customer in the particular segment rated company against major competitor on each attribute.
Monitor customer perceived value over time.

Consumer Values, Product Benefits and Customer Value: a Consumption  Behavior Approach



Albert Wenben Lai, University of Wisconsin-Madison

That's the keyC to anticipating their needs, to      solving their problems, to bringing them opportunities they might not find on their      own." C J. P. Morgan   INTRODUCTION Most marketing strategists will agree that creating customer value is  fundamental to both profit-seeking companies and nonprofit organizations. Indeed, creating  superior customer value is a necessary condition for a company securing a niche in a  competitive environment, not to mention a leadership position in the market (Day 1990).  According to Porter (1980), a company can follow two generic routes to compete in a  market: differentiation and low-cost. Day (1990) maintains that both approaches have the  same objectiveC to create superior customer  value, because "regardless of which of these routes is emphasized, the effort will  fail unless significant customer value is created" (Day 1990, p. 163).  Day (1990) addresses the issues in analyzing customer value and proposes  that it can be expressed in a "value equation": "Customer's Perceived  Benefits-Customer's Perceived Costs=Perceived Customer Value" (p. 142). Although  Day's approach to customer value is basically sound, some details regarding consumer  customers remain unclear. For example, the process by which consumers perceive product  benefits is nebulous: Day particularly addresses product valuation by industrial customers  in detail, but this is only in principle a part of a much more complex process of product  valuation by consumers. Hence a theoretical framework which underlies the consumers'  overall product valuation is still missing in the literature. Such a framework should  address the issues of how consumers perceive the benefits and costs of products, as well  as what possible benefits and costs consumers may perceive from products in the market.  The current paper tries to fill these gaps. In addition, the word "value" has discrepant meanings in the  marketing literature, especially between its two areas: marketing strategy and consumer  behavior. What marketing strategists mean by "customer value" is quite different  from the meanings of the "consumer values" discussed in consumer behavior  research (Clawson and Vinson 1978; Kahle 1977; Peter and Olson 1990; Sheth, Newman and  Gross 1991; Vinson, Scott and Lamont 1977; Wilkie 1990). Generally speaking,  "customer value" focuses on the buyers' evaluation of product purchase at the  time of buying, while "consumer values" stress people's valuation on the  consumption or possession of products. Actually, Day's approach to customer value (Day  1990), by emphasizing the customers' perceptions, indicates a direction in which the two  different, but related, concepts of "value(s)" in marketing discipline might be  integrated. The current paper helps accomplish this integration by suggesting a model of  customer value for consumer markets. This paper first reviews the literature on consumption behavior analysis  relevant to marketing strategy. Next, a framework of product valuation for consumers and  its typology of product benefit are proposed based on the consumption behavior analysis.  After the process of product valuation for consumers has been made clear, the paper  presents a comprehensive model of customer value for the consumer market integrating  consumer values, product benefits, logistic benefits, and various costs of consumption. In  the proposed model, product benefits, logistic benefits, and costs are defined in terms of  consumers' perception in the activities of acquisition, consumption (or using) and  maintenance, as well as consumers' expectation of personal values satisfaction before  buying. Finally, the implications of consumption behavior analysis for marketing strategy  are discussed. CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND MARKETING STRATEGY Many marketing researchers have maintained that detailed analyses of  consumption behavior are the fundamental basis for creating superior customer value for  consumers (Day 1990; Boyd and Levy 1963; Treacy and Wiersema 1993; Normann and Ramirez  1993). The importance of a comprehensive analysis of customers' consumption activities in  planning effective marketing strategies was first pointed out by Boyd and Levy (1963).  They maintain that marketing strategies should be planned and implemented in terms of the  customer's needs and behavior patterns. Also, the core element of an effective marketing  plan is to think in terms of the "consumption system" in which the product plays  a part. Boyd and Levy defined a consumption system as "the way a purchaser of a  product performs the total task ... that he or she is trying to accomplish when using the  product C not baking a cake, but preparing a  meal" (Boyd and Levy 1963, pp. 129-130).  Underlying this systematic view of consumption are at least two concepts  critical to customer value analysis. First, this systematic view looks beyond the purchase  behavior of buyers to the use behavior of consumers: "Whatever reasons people have  for buying a particular product are rooted in how they use that product, and how well it  serves the use to which they put it" (Boyd and Levy 1963, p. 130). Second, the  systematic view emphasizes the dynamic interrelations between the products that comprise a  consumption system: "The use behavior for a particular product is bound to be  affected not only by ... the task to be performed with the use of that product but also by  the related products and their use behaviors that make up the total consumption  system" (Boyd and Levy 1963, p. 130).  Based on their observation of the holistic nature of customer judgment,  Day et al. (1979) advocated the application of customer-oriented approaches to defining a  product-market and then identifying its competitive structure. In particular, Day and his  colleagues endorsed a usage-situation approach to defining a product-market (or  competitive) structure. The usage-situation approach emphasizes that the anticipated use,  the functions to be served, and the consumption context of a product ultimately influence  consumers' choices among products/brands (Srivastava 1981). Although it takes a systematic  view of consumption, the usage-situation approach stresses that the substitutability among  products/brands in the usage-situation determines market structures (i.e., the competitive  providers) of the product-type in question (Srivastava, Alpert and Shocker 1984). While  the usage-situation approach is based on the holistic view of consumption behavior and is  dubbed customer-oriented, it deals only with companies' need to define their  product-market structures. It has nothing to do with the analysis of customer value and  how this value can be expanded. As Solomon (1983) points out, conventional marketing  research has paid much more attention to the substitutability of products than to their  complementarity, and the usage-situation approach is no exception. In summary, the  literature on consumption behavior analysis can proceed further to conceptualize the  aspects of complementarity-in-use of products through which consumer may derive product  benefits holistically in the product complement. FIGURE 1 A FRAMEWORK OF PRODUCT VALUATION FOR CONSUMERS CONSUMER'S PRODUCT VALUATION AND TYPOLOGY OF PRODUCT BENEFITS The questions of how and what consumers perceive from products in the  market request the process and structure by which consumers value the products. Based on  consumption behavior analysis, the current paper proposes a framework of product valuation  for consumers and its typology of product benefits (see Figure 1). This model stresses  that to investigate the consumer's product valuation, it is necessary to integrate  cultural values, personal values, consumption values, and product benefits (Clawson and  Vinson 1978).  Cultural Values  Cultural, social, and familial environments affect the formation and  development of individual beliefs. In a socio-cultural environment, a set of values  usually represents widely shared beliefs about what is desirable. These socio-cultural  beliefs are called cultural values or "society core values" (Engel, Blackwell  and Miniard 1990) and are implanted into individuals "naturally" through  socialization and education, perhaps with some modification as personality and attitude  moderate the learning process. For example, Kahle (1985) proposes a "List of  Values" (LOV) generic to American culture in the 1980s, such as self-respect,  security, self-fulfillment, fun and enjoyment in life, and warm relationships with others.  These cultural values are seen by some social thinkers as "objective" (Frondizi  1963). This notion of being objective implies that they are commonly known to the members  of a society. However, not all of the cultural values in a society will be adopted  unanimously by its members. Some cultural values might be followed by only a small portion  of the people, while other values might be accepted widely. In sum, cultural values are  generic beliefs about what a society argues to be desirable and beneficial. These values  are then freely adopted on an individual basis. Personal Values Personal values are the individuals' beliefs about what are desirable to  themselves. They are self-centered; that is, personal values are closely linked to needs.  Moreover, they are derived from, and modified through, personal, social, and cultural  learning (Clawson and Vinson 1978). From a cognitive perspective, personal values are the  mental representations of underlying needs after the modification, taking into account the  realities of the world and reflecting the individual's personality (Wilkie 1990). For  example, the cultural value of "self-fulfillment" might be manifested quite  differently in the minds of two individuals with different familial and personal  backgrounds. According to Rokeach (1973), human values have two main types: terminal  and instrumental. Terminal (or end-state) values are beliefs people have about the goals  for which they strive (e.g., self-fulfillment, or enjoyment in life). Instrumental (or  means) values are beliefs about desirable ways to attain these terminal values (e.g.,  owning an elegant house, or taking a vacation). Therefore, personal values generally  correspond to terminal values, while values of desirable activities (to be discussed next)  are comparable to instrumental values. Personal values are enduring beliefs which guide  various actions and judgments across specific situations. Hence, personal values are more  abstract and may be generalizable easier than values of actions. In other words, the  concept of personal values is similar to the idea of "global values" (in the  realm of a person's perception) proposed by Vinson et al. (1977); these are small in  number (dozens) and considered to be at high levels of conceptualization. Consumption Values Consumption values refer to subjective beliefs about desirable ways to  attain personal values. People achieve personal values (or goals) through actions or  activities, such as social interaction, economic exchange, possession, and consumption  (Sheth et al. 1991). According to means-end chain models of consumer product knowledge  (Peter and Olson 1990), people may have ideas and preferences about various actions that  can help them achieve personal values. Therefore, relative to personal values, consumption  values are instrumental in nature. For example, owning an elegant house and acquiring a  prestigious car are for some people desirable ways of achieving self-fulfillment.  Attending football games (especially those of favorite teams) and taking a vacation trip  are favorable activities which lead to personal fun and enjoyment. Furthermore,  individuals may hold several personal values by which they direct or evaluate consumption  activities. Therefore, the consumption values of these types of activities (or  possessions) are sophisticated and do not simply satisfy one single personal value (Shet  et al. 1991). As we can observe in ourselves or others, consumption activities usually  include an assortment of goods and services (Boyd and Levy 1963). For example,  "owning an elegant house" requires house owners to acquire many goods and  services in addition to the house itself, just as "taking a vacation trip"  involves many other related acquisitions. Moreover, in a product constellation for a  consumption activity, there may be some properties in common. McCracken (1988) observes  that "the consumer goods in any complement are linked by some commonality or  unity" (p. 119). From a social interaction perspective, Solomon (1983) maintains that  consumers employ product constellations in "setting the stage" for the social  roles they play. Product constellations occur, because individuals use entire complements  of products to achieve personal values. The products unified in a constellation all carry  the same information about individual values. Furthermore, Lai (1994) maintained that  consumers may obtain satisfaction holistically from the related consumption activities and  the constellation of products in use. Consumption Schemata Cognitive psychologists maintain that people may acquire knowledge  structures to represent various consumption activities and product constellations (Abelson  1976; Crocker 1984). Lai (1994) uses the term consumption schema to refer to the cognitive  structure which organizes and represents personal ideas and beliefs about the substance of  a consumption activity, such as interrelationships among complementary products, the  cultural value and social meanings of the commodities, and personal preferences and  affective associations. Hence, a consumption schema represents a consumer's basic thoughts  about a consumption activity, though peripheral adjustments may be needed to accommodate  the specific situation in which the consumption takes place. In short, in consumption, or  possession of products, people may acquire personal consumption schemata (or a particular  planned pattern), including their anticipation of and requirements for a product (or a  complement of products), reflecting their consumption values of that consumption or  possession. Typology of Product Benefits From the customers' perspective, products are viewed as a bundle of  benefits, not attributes (Day 1990; Peter and Olson 1990). In other words, "customers  are less interested in the technical features of a product or service than in what  benefits they get from buying, using or consuming the product." (Hooley and Saunders  1993, p. 17) In a competitive market, in addition to their basic benefits, products  usually have many other attributes, such as features, styles, symbolism, durability,  quality, and related services. By designing products with combinations of these  attributes, marketers try to attract consumers with particular consumption values. A comprehensive understanding of possible benefits that customers may seek  in products is a fundamental basis for marketers to formulate sound marketing strategies,  especially product differentiation or positioning (Peter 1990; Boyd and Levy 1968). Sheth  et al. (1991) categorize five product benefits which influence the consumer's choice  behavior: functional, social, emotional, epistemic and conditional. However, these  benefits are only generic; that is, they are general, potential, and not yet applied to a  specific consumption activity. Moreover, because Sheth et al.'s analysis is not grounded  in a holistic approach to consumption behavior analysis, Sheth and his colleagues conflate  product benefits with consumption values; that is, they do not distinguish "generic  product benefits" from "consumption values," as the current paper does.  Furthermore, their categorization ignores other important generic product benefits: e.g.,  hedonic benefits, aesthetic benefits, and holistic benefits. Going beyond Sheth et al.'s original categorization of product benefits  (Sheth et al. dubbed them as "consumption values"), the current paper proposes a  typology of product benefits that a consumer may derive from possession or consumption.  The typology includes eight generic product benefits: functional, social, affective,  epistemic, aesthetic, hedonic, situational, and holistic. The definitions of these terms  are discussed briefly in what follows: (1) Functional benefit refers to a product's capacity for functional,  utilitarian, or physical performance. Functional benefits are derived from the tangible  and concrete attributes that a consumer may directly experience when using or consuming  the product. (2) Social benefits are the perceptual benefits acquired from a product's  association with social class, social status, or a specific social group. Highly visible  products (e.g., clothing, jewelry, and automobiles) often carry social benefits. (3) Affective benefit refers to the perceptual benefit acquired from a  product's capacity to arouse feelings or affective states. Affective benefits are often  associated with cultural-ethnic meanings (e.g., Christmas trees, Thanksgiving turkeys) or  personal, idiosyncratic meanings, tastes and memories (e.g., foods that arouse feelings of  comfort through their association with childhood experiences, or cars with which consumers  are said to have "love affairs"). (4) Epistemic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a product's  capacity to satisfy curiosity, provide novelty, and/or meet a desire for knowledge.  Exploratory, novelty-seeking, and variety-seeking consumption behaviors are examples of  epistemic value pursuit. Also, a consumer's propensity to adopt new products is consistent  with epistemic benefit (Sheth et al. 1991). (5) Aesthetic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a product's  capacity to present a sense of beauty or to enhance personal expression. Aesthetic benefit  usually is subjective and idiosyncratic. Style demands, product-appearance demands, art  purchases, and fashion-following are examples of consumers' pursuing aesthetic benefits. (6) Hedonic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a product's  capacity to meet a need of enjoyment, fun, pleasure, or distraction from work or anxiety.  Olshavsky and Granbois (1979) claim that hedonic benefit is an important dimension of many  products. People are not always looking for rational or "serious" benefits; they  may want to relax or be distracted. Taking a vacation trip, going to bars, watching  sports, comic movies or TV programs, or even buying funny trinkets to make fun of friends  are examples of hedonic benefit pursuit. (7) Situational benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a product's  capacity to meet situational needs in specific circumstances. A product acquires  situational value in the presence of antecedent physical or social contingencies that  enhance its functional, social, or other benefits. Situational benefit is measured on the  profile of a particular consumption situation. (8) Holistic benefit refers to the perceptual benefit acquired from the  complementarity, coherence, compatibility, and consistency in a product constellation as a  whole. Holistic benefits are frequently required and perceived in clothes, furniture, and  food consumption. Holistic product benefit is a result of "synergy" derived from  a product combination. Its implications for marketing strategy will be discussed later in  detail. Different types of product benefits may be correlated and combined in  particular consumption activities, or there may be trading off between them. In addition,  a product may offer multiple generic benefits. For example,    "to a first-time home buyer, the purchase of a home might provide      functional [benefit] (the home contains more space than the present apartment), social      [benefit] (friends are also buying homes), emotional [benefit] (the consumer feels secure      in owning a home), epistemic [benefit] (the novelty of purchasing a home is enjoyable),      and situational [benefit] (starting a family)" [The braces are the author's, to      substitute the word "benefit" for the original word "value" and avoid      confusion. The parentheses, however, are in the original passage.] (Sheth et al. 1991; p.      163).   Perceived Product Benefits Generic product benefits are intended benefits that manufacturers design  into a product. However, these intended benefits may or may not be perceived or  appreciated by particular consumers. A product has benefit to customers to the degree that  they can perceive, appreciate and then use that product as anticipated consumption  activities to achieve personal values. Normann and Ramirez (1993) recapitulate this  concept well; "A company's offerings have values to the degree that customers can use  them as inputs to leverage their own value creation. In this respect, then, companies  don't profit from customers. They profit from customers' value-creating activities"  (p. 74). In sum, consumers perceive and appreciate product benefits via their personal  consumption values and consumption schemata; these product benefits are termed  "Perceived Product Benefits" (Day 1990).  In summary, the framework of consumers' product valuation delineates the  relationship between "personal values", "generic product benefits",  and "perceived product benefits" via "consumption values" and  "consumption schemata" (see Figure 1). That is, it illuminates the structure of  consumers' product valuation and how and what benefits consumers may perceive from  products. With this framework of product valuation for consumers and its typology of  product benefits in place, the current paper proceeds to investigate the concept of  customer value. A MODEL OF CUSTOMER VALUE FOR CONSUMER MARKETS Customer Value and Consumer Values Many marketing strategists and industrial-organization (I.O.) economists  emphasize that creating superior "customer value" is a key element for  companies' success (Day 1990, Porter 1980). However, what they mean by "customer  value" is quite different from the meanings of the "consumer values" we  have discussed above. "Value" to marketing strategists means a return for  something in an exchange (e.g., the value of the dollar is variable). Therefore, the  meaning of "customer value" is a level of return in the product benefits for  certain amount of customer's money (i.e., the price) in a purchase exchange (e.g., to give  the buyer good value at the right price). In addition, the concept of customer value has  by nature a normative perspective, since it is a fundamental concept underlying the  competitive analysis in the field of I.O., based on economic principles and the customer's  choice in the market.  Consumer behavior researchers, on the other hand, generally use the word  "values" to mean something desirable, useful, or important (Peter and Olson  1990). Our previous discussion also adopted this meaning. Consumer research usually is  based on a descriptive-study perspective, such as in the fields of anthropology,  sociology, and psychology. Therefore, "consumer values" refers to the important  personal goals that consumers are seeking (Wilkie 1990). Furthermore, consumer behavior  researchers emphasize that people can achieve some of their personal values through  possession or consumption of products (Peter and Olson 1990; Sheth, et al. 1991). In summary, "customer value" normatively focuses on a buyer's  evaluation at the time of a product purchase, while "consumer values"  descriptively stresses people's valuation of product consumption or possession. Consumer  researchers will argue that consumers buy products not for the sake of its  "transactional value" (a simple term for customer value) but for the product's  benefits that will satisfy their needs or personal values. Our earlier discussions of the  process of consumer valuation explored the domain of consumer benefits in product  consumption or possession. However, in an exchange environment, product benefits alone do  not completely explain consumers' product choice. Often, consumers may find products very  desirable. Yet, in assuming that the consumer has adequate financial capacity, one must  not equally assume that a purchase must follow. These cases imply that normative points of  view are also necessary in consumer choice research. From an economics perspective,  consumers may apply cost-and-benefit evaluation to a purchase decision, at least when the  costs are "significant" to them (Olshavsky and Granbois 1979). Therefore, with  respect to a sound customer value analysis for a consumer market, both the descriptive and  normative aspects are essential (Boyd and Levy 1963; Day 1990).  The current paper proposes a comprehensive model of customer value for  consumer markets (see Figure 2), based on Day's original idea of "value  equation" and emphasizing customers' perception (Day 1990). This model integrates  descriptive and normative points of view about consumer behavior, including the consumer  values expectation before purchase, customer value evaluation at the time of buying, and  value actualization in consumption or possession. FIGURE 2 A MODEL OF CUSTOMER VALUE FOR CONSUMER MARKET The Model According to social psychologists, people's perception of objects and  events is influenced by their cognitive traits (e.g., personality and attitude, personal  values, and consumption schemata) and demographics (e.g., age, education, income and  wealth, and time resources). As indicated in Figure 2, these factors of "Customer  Characteristics" are the background of the customers' perception. The buyers' evaluation of a product purchase begins from their perceived  product benefits. The earlier discussions of consumers' product valuation have proposed a  framework about how the customers perceive product benefits based on their terminal  personal values and instrumental consumption values (or consumption schemata). In  addition, the discussion has suggested and illustrated a typology of generic product  benefits with eight categories. As indicated in Figure 2, the model suggests that  "Perceived Product Benefits" could be a single type or a combination of the  eight categories of product benefits. Nowadays, product benefits based on consumption or use of the product are  not the sole benefits consumers can perceive (Day 1990). They may also derive benefits of  a purchase from the buying activities per se and other consumption supporting features.  Treacy and Wiersema (1993) claim that today's customers have "an expanded concept of  value [purchase benefits] that includes convenience of purchase, [and] after-sale  service" (p. 84), in addition to the traditional product benefits, such as quality  and price. We conceptualize these new dimensions of purchase benefit and denote them as  "logistic benefits." Logistic benefits of a product purchase are those benefits  consumers can derive from the buying per se and other (after-purchase) consumption  supporting features about the product. These include the purchase convenience, buying  pleasure, variety of choice, short ordering time, availability of parts and supplies,  warranty, and after-sale service. For the purpose of this discussion, the current paper  does not probe the typology of logistic benefits. These logistic features, if designed by  marketers in the product deal, are also subject to subjective consumers' perceptions to  become desirable benefits for customers. Moreover, the perceptions of the customers are  moderated by their personal values, consumption values, and other individual  characteristics (see Figure 2).  As mentioned above, the costs of obtaining the perceived product and  logistic benefits are usually the major concerns of buyers, since consumers may apply  principles of costs-and-benefits to evaluate a purchase. The model proposes that the  relevant costs of a purchase considered by consumer include monetary cost, time cost,  risks, and human energy cost. Furthermore, every category of the costs may play a part in  purchase, possession, consumption, and maintenance. The monetary cost refers simply to  monetary payment. The time cost refers to the amount of time required for the relevant  activities of acquisition or consumption. Consumers encounter risks when they face the  uncertainty or potential negative consequences of consumer activities: being cheated,  overcharged, or misled into buying an unnecessary product; while possessing or using  certain products, such as unconventional clothes, may incur social costs which include  being teased by colleagues. Maintenance risks include being overcharged for supplies and  or suffering the possibility that they will be discontinued. Finally, the human energy  cost refers to physical effort, difficulty of operation, and cognitive energy; these might  be of great concern to elderly customers. Nevertheless, all of these costs, like the  benefits, are also subject to consumers' perception. Since perceptions of time, money,  risk, and human energy vary among people, these costs may be evaluated differently among  customers. According to the cost-and-benefit principle, customers evaluate the  benefits against the costs and perceive the buying value of products. As indicated in  Figure 2, the inputs of evaluation are the "perceived product benefits",  "perceived logistic benefits", and "perceived costs". However, as  suggested by many paradigms in consumer research, such as expectancy-value research  (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) and elimination-by-aspects analysis (Tversky, 1972), not all  benefits and costs are equally evaluated. Some benefits and costs are considered central  factors and are therefore weighted heavily, while others are perceived as peripheral  factors and weighted less. This phenomenon concerning consumers' idiosyncratic patterns of  weighting for the evaluating factors is also reflected in the model.  Finally, the model suggests that customer value is a consequence of  subjective evaluation which in turn results from the summing up of the various perceived  benefits and perceived costs, taking into account the differently weighted factors. In  other words, the "perceived customer value" in the model is defined as the  surplus (or the difference) between perceived benefits and perceived costs (Day 1990);  that is, it refers to a level of subjective return for the customer perceived costs. DISCUSSION: IMPLICATIONS FOR MARKETING STRATEGY In the current model of consumer customer value, product benefits,  logistic benefits, and costs are defined in terms of consumers' perception in the  activities of acquisition, consumption (or using) and maintenance, as well as consumers'  expectation of personal values satisfaction before buying. In other words, our consumption  behavior approach is holistic analysis-oriented, going beyond traditional  "customer-oriented" methods which usually focus on the buyers' economic  evaluation at purchase. As emphasized in the model, the importance of product benefits, logistic  benefits, and costs vary among people due to their individual characteristics. These  phenomena have led in marketing practice to benefit or cost segmentationC the process of dividing consumers into homogenous  subgroups or segments based on their interest in particular product benefits. The benefits  most important (central) to target customers is a fundamental issue in marketing  strategies, such as product differentiation and positioning. For example, to succeed with  a "value strategy" (also a high price strategy) a company needs to offer  products with premium quality in the central benefits, such that their customers  "correctly" perceive those benefits and are willing to pay the price premium  (Treacy and Wiersema 1993). On the other hand, to make a "cost strategy" (or a  low price strategy) profitable, a company must offer products with an acceptable level of  quality in the central benefits and minimal quality in the peripheral factors, such that  their customers will enjoy the product and perceive the purchase as a value (Normann and  Ramfrez 1993).  The current paper's implications for market positioning are clear: its  categorization of generic product and logistic benefits may help marketers identify their  target consumers' central and peripheral benefits. Then, the typology could help companies  design their products and related marketing programs, such as advertising and  distribution.  Holistic Product Benefits and Marketing Strategy One new category of product benefit introduced in the current paper is the  "holistic product benefits" customers may perceive and appreciate in a product  constellation. This type of product benefit has been largely ignored in the literature.  Their implications for marketing practice will be discussed next. In consumption settings where multiple products are needed, the product  constellation forms a "consumption system" (Boyd and Levy 1963). A consumer may  obtain utility holistically from the product constellation based on a personal consumption  schema. When a consumer tries to combine a product constellation and to construct from it  a meaningful combination, certain dimensions of compatibility and complementarity between  products may be critical to perception of the products' benefits. These dimensions briefly  described here (for a detail discussion and examples, please see Lai [1994]): (1)  "functional exhaustivity" suggests that products are combined in a way that the  required functions are completely fulfilled; (2) "operational connectivity"  suggests that the operations (or the physical shapes and positions) of the products are  smoothly connected. (3) "aesthetic coherence" relates to the sense of beauty or  to personal expression in the product constellation; and, (4) "meaning-role  consistency" refers to the perceived coherence between the cultural meanings of  products and the social roles which the consumers assume (Solomon 1983). The holistic product benefits may be a good basis for product positioning.  As defined previously in the current paper, holistic product benefit refers to the  perceptual benefits acquired from the complementarity, coherence, compatibility, and  consistency in a product constellation as a whole. A company could set itself apart from  the competition by identifying and promoting itself as the best provider of certain  holistic benefits of a product constellation to satisfy consumer's needs. In pursuing a  competitive positioning through holistic product benefits, the company may need to reshape  its business scope or redefine its product lines, and consequently obtain its sustainable  competitive advantage.  Organizations can design competitive marketing strategies based on  meaningful and desirable combinations of product benefits for their customers. How to  select a competitive strategy and the desirable benefits of the product will largely  depend on the company's knowledge about the customers' consumption behavior. In addition,  the relative defensibility of the strategy in the market is another problem in selecting a  competitive strategy. The consumption behavior approach to the customer value would  provide more strengths in strategy defensibility. For example, the positioning through  holistic product benefits can enjoy the synergetic effects derived from a meaningful  product combination that is developed from a comprehensive knowledge of customer  consumption behavior. Furthermore, sometimes a company has to coordinate a complementary  business group (also a synergy generating activity) to provide meaningful product  combinations to customers (Normann and Ramirez 1993). In these situations, the  defensibility of the competitive strategy would be even stronger because of the synergetic  effects. Normann and Ramirez (1993) recapitulate this implication for marketing strategy  well: "One of the chief strategic challenges of the new economy is to integrate [the  consumption behavior] knowledge and [the interfirm] relationshipsC devise a good fit between [companies'] competencies  and customers [(customers' needs or individual values)]..." (p. 74). CONCLUSION The consumption behavior approach to customer value can be an effective  way of achieving more innovation, enhancing customer value, and obtaining greater  marketing penetration and strategy sustainability. Consumption, like production, involves  a constellation of goods and consumption values or desirable benefits. If marketers think  of consumers as engaged in a constructive process by which they achieve their consumption  values, it may be easy to see that a variety of holistic benefits are involved as  customers use the products (Boyd and Levy 1963). Although the marketers may already plan  and act in terms of consumer needs and behavior patterns, they can gain even more insight  if they study consumer's consumption behaviors in which their products play a part. For  knowledge of the customers' consumption behavior to be truly meaningful, much more would  have to be known about the customers' personal values, feelings and thoughts, and  consumption values. In other words, understanding the consumers' consumption behavior  means that their activities should be analyzed thoroughly and holistically, from the  expectation about consumption values at the prepurchase stage, to the purchase evaluation  at the stage of selection and acquisition, to consumption values actualization in the  stage of use, possession, and maintenance. One caveat about customer value: greater customer value does not  necessarily equal greater customer satisfaction. Customer value is defined as the  difference (or surplus) between benefits and costs; it is a level of return for customer  costs. From a cognitive perspective, according to expectation theory, satisfaction is the  result of a comparison between what actually occurs and what is expected. Hence the  customers' buying satisfaction depends on both their perceived value of the purchase and  their knowledge of what a fair level of buying value should be. In short, customers will  feel satisfied to the extent that the perceived value of their buying exceeds the standard  they hold. From this point of view, exceeding value is the key for customer satisfaction,  not customer value per se (a surplus value). This issue can be viewed as an avenue for  further study.

Related Terms: Exporting
An international exchange rate, also known as a foreign exchange (FX) rate, is the price of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency. Foreign exchange rates are relative and are expressed as the value of one currency compared to another. When selling products internationally, the exchange rate for the two trading countries' currencies is an important factor. Foreign exchange rates, in fact, are one of the most important determinants of a countries relative level of economic health, ranking just after interest rates and inflation. Exchange rates play a vital role in a country's level of trade, which is critical to most every free market economy in the world. Consequently, exchange rates are among the most watched, analyzed, and manipulated economic measures.
Recent History
Prior to 1971, foreign exchange rates were fixed by an agreement among the world's central banks called the Bretton Woods Accord. This agreement was entered into after World War II. The world was in a shambles and the Bretton Woods Accord was established to help stabilize the volatile situation by pegging the U.S. dollar to gold and all other currencies of the world to the U.S. dollar. In 1971 a new agreement was formulated to replace the Bretton Woods Accord but it was short lived. In 1973 the world's currencies began to be valued and exchanged based on a free-float system, a system still in place in 2006. The free-float system is a default system of currency trading. It works strictly on supply and demand of currencies. There are no limits on how much currencies can appreciate or depreciate in value measured against other currencies. Because this can cause volatility, central banks and governments have tried to regulate the values of their currencies, but it has become an increasingly costly proposition. Although no longer an official standard, the U.S. dollar remains the benchmark currency, with the Japanese yen (¥) and European euro ('‚¬) close behind.
Currency Value Factors
A number of factors influence exchange rates. These include all of the following:

Relative rates of inflation
Comparative interest rates
Growth of domestic money supply
Size and trend of a country's balance of payments
Economic growth (as measured by the gross national product)
Dependency on outside energy sources
Central bank intervention

In addition to these measures of economic activity, the consensus perception of a majority of countries about the overall strength of one country's currency can have a strong impact on how that one country's currency is valued.
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET
As nations and their economies have become increasingly interdependent, the FX market has emerged as a global focal point. With an estimated daily FX turnover exceeding $1 trillion, this is by far the world's largest market. In order to remain competitive in the world economy, it is vital to manage the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. In recent times, the worldwide trend has been toward the consolidation of markets and currencies, as in the case of the European Economic Union.
The largest users of the FX market are commercial banks, which serve as intermediaries between currency buyers and sellers. Corporations and financial institutions also trade currencies, primarily to safeguard their foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities against adverse FX rate movement. Banks and fund managers trade currencies to profit from FX rate movements. Individuals also are subject to fluctuating FX rates, most commonly when a traveler exchanges his/her native currency for a foreign one before embarking on a business trip or vacation.
When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced trading in foreign currency futures in 1972, it enabled all currency market participants, including individual investors, to capitalize on FX rate fluctuations without having to make or take delivery of the actual currencies. Foreign currency futures offer risk management and profit opportunities to individual investors, as well as to small firms and large companies.
There are two types of potential users of foreign currency futures: the hedger and the speculator. The hedger seeks to reduce and manage the risk of financial losses that can arise from transacting business in currencies other than one's native currency. Speculators provide risk capital and assume the risk the hedger is seeking to transfer in the hope of making a profit by correctly forecasting future price movement.
THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON BUSINESS
The results of companies that operate in more than one nation often must be "translated" from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Exchange rate fluctuations make financial forecasting more difficult for these companies, and also have a marked effect on unit sales, prices, and costs. For example, assume that current market conditions dictate that one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for  125 Japanese yen. In this business environment, an American auto dealer plans to import a Japanese car with a price of 2.5 million yen, which translates to a price in dollars of $20,000. If that dealer also incurred $2,000 in transportation costs and decided to mark up the price of the car by another $3,000, then the vehicle would sell for $25,000 and provide the dealer with a profit margin of 12 percent.
But if the exchange rate changed before the deal was made so that one dollar was worth 100 yen—in other words, if the dollar weakened or depreciated compared to the yen—it would have a dramatic effect on the business transaction. The dealer would then have to pay the Japanese manufacturer $25,000 for the car. Adding in the same costs and mark up, the dealer would have to sell the car for $30,000, yet would only receive a 10 percent profit margin. The dealer would either have to negotiate a lower price from the Japanese manufacturer or cut his profit margin further to be able to sell the vehicle.
Under this FX scenario, the price of American goods would compare favorably to that of Japanese goods in both domestic and foreign markets. The opposite would be true if the dollar strengthened or appreciated against the yen, so that it would take more yen to buy one dollar. This type of exchange rate change would lower the price of foreign goods in the U.S. market and hurt the sales of U.S. goods both domestically and overseas.

User Value: Competing Theories and Models
Suzan Boztepe
Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey
In design research, the issues of what exactly constitutes user value and how design can contribute to its creation are not commonly discussed. This paper provides a critical overview of the theories of value used in anthropology, sociology, philosophy, business, and economics. In doing so, it reviews a range of theoretical and empirical studies, with particular emphasis on their position on product, user, and designer in the process of value creation. The paper first looks at the similarities and differences among definitions of value as exchange, sign, and experience. It then reviews types and properties of user value such as its multidimensionality, its contextuality, its interactivity, and the stages of user experience dependency identified by empirical studies. Methodological approaches to user value research and their possible applications in design are also discussed. Finally, directions for future research on user value are discussed giving particular emphasis to the need of tools and methods to support design practice.
Keywords – Consumer Value, User Value, User-Centered Design. 
Relevance to Design Practice – The critical overview of the notion of value presented in this paper would be of interest to designers adopting a user-centered approach, as it could guide their efforts to better understand users and deliver products which are of value to them.

Introduction
The concept of user-centered design has arguably given rise to one of the most fundamental changes in the field of design over the past few decades (Fulton Suri, 2003; Melican, 2004). Design has since shifted focus from giving form to objects and information to enabling user experiences, and from physical and cognitive human factors to the emotional, social, and cultural contexts in which products and communications take place (Heskett, 2002a; Margolin, 1997; Redstrom, 2006). This shift has been supported by business strategies aiming for sustainable competitive advantage. Today, there is a growing recognition that providing superior value for users is instrumental for business success (Cagan & Vogel, 2002; Kim & Mauborgne, 2005; Vandermerwe, 2000). Kim and Mauborgne (2005), for example, argue that focusing on creating advances in customer value can make competition irrelevant by opening up entirely new markets. In their investigation of what it takes to create breakthrough products, Cagan and Vogel (2002) conclude that one of the key attributes that distinguishes breakthrough products from their closest followers is the significant value they provide for users. After all, as Drucker (2001) has pointed out, "customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value" (p.172). In current research, however, the notion of user value still remains largely unexplored. For one thing, there is no established theory of value that can guide design. This paper is thus an attempt to provide a critical overview of the competing theories and models most prevalent in the study of user value. The paper first reviews definitional issues regarding user value in economics, sociology, anthropology, and business research. Next, similarities and differences among definitions of value as exchange, value as sign, and value as experience are discussed. Comparison among different theories is also made in terms of their perspective on what the source of user value is. The paper then reviews types and properties of user value identified by empirical studies. Design's role in creation of value is also discussed. Methodological approaches to user value research and their possible applications in design are then examined. Finally, directions for future research on user value are discussed, giving particular emphasis to the need of tools and methods to support design practice.
Definitional Issues
As with many aspects of design, the field is plagued by terminological confusion regarding the use of the term value. Part of the confusion comes from the fact that value is a highly polysemous word. Its meaning oscillates between concepts as distant as economic return and moral standards. For example, there is a general belief among designers that design can add value by the fact that it can be used to devise products with increased value and which embody moral values (Heskett, 2002c). Lack of consensus on the use of the term value, nevertheless, is not unique to the field of design. It spans a number of disciplines, including economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology and marketing. Within this spectrum, Graeber (2001) identifies the main approaches to the definition of value: (1) the notion of values as conception(s) of what is ultimately good in human life, (2) in an economic and business sense, value as a person's willingness to pay the price of a good in terms of cash in return for certain product benefits, (3) value as meaning and meaningful difference, and (4) value as action. Leaving aside the use of the term in its plural form, which stands for enduring beliefs or for what is ultimately good and desirable in life (Rokeach, 1973), the focus here will primarily be on terms such as consumer value or customer value, where value refers to the evaluation of some object/product by some subject/user. This focus seems to offer a relevant ground for discussion of value in design, as it promises to examine the concept of value within the user-product relationship.
Value as Exchange and Use
Reviewing some of the definitions of consumer value reveals that they are firmly placed within the economic paradigm, where value is defined in terms of the monetary sacrifice people are willing to make for a product (e.g., Butz & Goodstein, 1996; Gale, 1994; Zeithaml, 1988). The emphasis is on the point of exchange, and money is seen as a fundamental index of value. The assumption is that, at the moment of purchase, people make a rational evaluation and calculation of what is given versus what is taken in terms of money for product quality. Such a view may be problematic for design as it overlooks the situation of use. In a study on the assignment of value to fruit beverages, Zeithaml (1988) points out that use-related, non-monetary issues such as time and effort spent on the preparation of the beverage were important in users' assessments of product value, and concludes that these issues should be acknowledged as well. Also, for communication products, such as websites, there is no purchase stage or evaluation of choices on the spot as there is with physical products. In other words, the-money-spent-for-product-quality view of value seems to exclude a range of communication products. 
Marxist theory provides a useful distinction here. It conceives of value as having a dual nature—made up of use value and exchange value (Marx, 1990). Independent of labor, use value relates to the utility of the physical properties of a product, which is realized only upon its use. Although Marx does not further develop his theory of use value, he puts forward the idea that value is conditioned by the physical properties of products. 
The question of what is the source of value, however, constitutes one of the major disagreements among different theories. Is it something subjectively assigned by the user and independent of the product's physical qualities? Or, is it something embedded in the object and recognized by the user? These questions have been among the central issues of the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of value, known as axiology (Frondizi, 1971). In axiological theory, a bipolar distinction exists between objectivists and subjectivists. Positioning value as inherent in the object, as Marx claims, and existing before a subject interacts with or evaluates it, is a firmly objectivist view. It resonates well with Levitt's (1981) definition of product as "a promise, a cluster of value expectations" (p. 94). According to Porter's (1985) value chain, value is gradually added through the different stages of product development, manufacturing, and distribution. In other words, value is something that the producer puts into the product. Giving no account for the capability of users to imbue objects with meaning and value, such objectivist approaches are viewed as nothing but easily refutable (Frondizi, 1971; Holbrook, 1999). 
It is easy to refute this approach, for example, by recognizing that there is a range of goods such as gifts, memorabilia, photos and spiritual objects which are not necessarily utilitarian, nor do they circulate in the market. These goods do not have a monetary price attached to them, but they are considered to be of high value by the people who possess them (Belk, 1987; Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton, 1981). The theory of value as exchange or value as use thus seems to fall short in explaining the high value of this group of objects for their owners. 
Value as Sign
Anthropological and sociological theories, on the other hand, emphasize the social and cultural aspects of value. This includes taking into account the symbolic meanings that can be attributed to goods. Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton's (1981) study, for example, illustrates that the most valued domestic objects are valued primarily because of the symbolic meanings attached to them. People have an enormous capacity and tendency to invest objects with meanings that sometimes have nothing to do with their utility or with the meanings intended by their producers. They often value objects not for what they do, or what they are made of, but for what they signify. In Veblen's (2001) conceptualization of conspicuous consumption, for example, goods are valued because they serve as an index of social status. And Baudrillard (1968/2006, 1970/1998) treats consumption as a way in which people converse with each other. This conversation involves a code shared by the members of a society, and the products act as signs communicating certain messages and images which are independent of their use. Their value is therefore a sign value, which displaces use value and exchange value. For example, it is quite common for people in the so-called developing countries to acquire Western goods not only for their utility but because of their imposed association with modernity and the lifestyles of their originators (Ger & Belk, 1996). An example of such consumption may be found among the Muria Gonds, where "the richer fishermen were spending their excess earnings to purchase unusable television sets [having no access to electricity], to build 'garages' onto houses to which no automobiles had access, and to install rooftop cisterns into which water never flows" (Gell, 1986, p. 114). Bourdieu (1979/1984) views such interaction with goods as a means of accumulating capital, mainly of a symbolic (i.e., in relation to the honor and prestige accumulated through one's practices) and social (e.g., in relation to one's own network of interpersonal relations) nature. This notion of value, then, calls for consideration not only of the use of products and communications but also of how they are made sense of and what the range of social ends they provide to users are, including ends involving issues of status, prestige, and identity. 
From the standpoint of the source of value, a value-as-sign approach posits that value emerges through the subjective experience of the user, and thus, objects cannot contain value. Value does not necessarily reside in an object's tangible materiality, but rather in the message it communicates. As in semiotics, physical form enables communication, but does not construct meaning, and therefore cannot be a source of value. It is the symbol systems which are known and shared in a society that construct value. Disregarding a product's capacity to shape meaning and users' experiences, this view is as easily refutable as the objectivist one. After all, designers create and alter forms with the purpose of modifying meaning and creating value.
Value as Experience
It is clear that in relating value to design, it is difficult to adopt any of the definitions reviewed so far. As Graeber (2001) has pointed out, each definition poses problems due to its lack of sufficient consideration of the other definitions. Heskett (2002b) also has noted that it is often difficult to talk about the utility/use or significance/meaning of an object or communication separately because, in practice, they are closely interwoven. It is equally difficult to argue that value resides in an object's materiality or in a symbol system alone. Frondizi (1971) advocates an intermediate position where value is created at the interface of the product and the user. As Holbrook (1999) puts it, "value resides not in the product purchased, not in the brand chosen, not in the object possessed, but rather in the consumption experience(s) derived therefrom" (p. 8). Such a perspective of value as experience, where a product's value pertains to the experiences associated with that product, offers the potential for reconciling the different approaches offered so far. 
This perspective does not, nevertheless, provide an exclusive alternative to other definitions, but rather, it encompasses many aspects of them (Table 1). At its core is the premise that what people actually desire is not products, but the experiences products provide (Pine & Gilmore, 1999). As Cagan and Vogel (2002) point out, "[s]ince products enable an experience for the user, the better the experience, the greater the value of the product to the consumer" (p. 62). Amazon.com, for instance, is valued for the superior shopping and browsing experience it provides, and OXO Good Grips products for the easy and comfortable food preparation experience that they provide.
Experiences emerge from interaction between the product and the user. Any user activity involving a product is an engagement in experience with that product. However, it should be noted that, although activities are central to the concept of experience, they are not equal to it. Dewey (1966) writes:
The nature of experience can be understood only by noting that it includes an active and passive element peculiarly combined. On the active hand, experience is 'trying'--a meaning which is made explicit in the connected term experiment. On the passive side it is 'undergoing'. When we experience something we act upon it, we do something with it; then we suffer or undergo the consequences. We do something to the thing and it does something to us in return. Mere activity does not constitute experience. It is dispersive, centrifugal, dissipating. (p. 146)
Activity usually consists of a series of actions oriented towards a specific goal (Leont'ev, 1978). Experience, on the other hand, involves the additional dimension of reflecting upon the consequences of one's activities. As Margolin (2002) puts it, experience has both operative and reflective dimensions. "The operative dimension refers to the way we make use of products for our activities. The reflective dimension addresses the way we think about a product and give it meaning" (p. 42). In other words, experiences with products relate not only to the activities but also to the meanings they add to people's lives, such as the symbolic meanings described in Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton's (1981) study. Therefore, the notion of value as experience encompasses aspects of both utility and social significance consequences created through interaction with products. User experience involves the juxtaposition of (1) user context and characteristics, and (2) whatever features the product brings to the interaction, including both formal and functional characteristics. Users interact with products within the context of their goals, needs, cultural expectations, physical context, and emotions. And products, with their tangible and intangible qualities, can influence the way users interact with them. What we call user value is thus created as a result of the interaction between what the product provides and what the users bring in terms of their goals, needs, limitations, etc. 
Yet, the definition of value as experience is not without problems. For one thing, it attempts to define such an elusive term as value with another similarly elusive one. Despite its centrality to design theory and practice, the knowledge of what constitutes user experience and how to understand and enhance it is yet in its babbling stage. It is necessary that the discussion of value in design be developed in sync with a discussion on user experience.
Table 1. An Overview of the Definitional Approaches to User Value 

Properties of User Value
Relative and Contextual
If value is closely tied with experience, then it carries some of the properties of experience. According to Dewey (1938), experience is not something that is totally internal to the individual, but instead, "an experience is always what it is because of a transaction taking place between an individual and what, at the time, constitutes his environment" (p. 43). Experiences are context- and situation-specific; that is, they change from one set of immediate circumstances, time, and location to another. In a similar way, value changes as cultural values and norms, and external contextual factors, change (Overby, Woodruff, & Gardial, 2005). Consider the example of owning an automobile. Having a car in a small U.S. town increases accessibility to different places, such as shopping malls, sites of interest, etc. However, the same car in a metropolitan city like New York, where parking space is virtually unavailable and traffic is dense, is a burden and restricts one's ability to move around. Thus, compatibility with the context, which includes a range of tangible and intangible systems, is necessary. The local context influences user-product interaction by imposing certain conditions, which may enhance or hinder people's experiences with products and their assignment of value. Specifically, a set of common behaviors, or ways of doing things; systems, with which products interface, such as infrastructure, organization of space, and institutional and geographical factors; and socially and culturally shared meanings, such as common symbols, rituals, and traditions, can be significant in shaping user value. Therefore, the same product may be assigned a different value by users in different contexts. For Holbrook (1999), the value of a product is not only relative to the context but also to the alternative products users are acquainted with. Valuation involves concepts such as evaluation and judgment, which imply a comparative process, and choice-making and preference for one option over another. 
Dependence on the Stages of Experience
In marketing research, a distinction exists between pre-purchase and post-purchase value (Gardial, Clemons, Woodruff, Schumann, & Burns, 1994; Jensen, 2001; Parasuraman, 1997; Woodruff, 1997). The former refers to expectations regarding the value a product is going to deliver that are formed prior to purchase of the product. An individual's anticipation of the experience a product may provide can be a strong factor motivating that person's decision to acquire and use that product. Post-purchase value, on the other hand, involves value realized through the use of a product. Therefore, one can rightfully argue that post-purchase value, or value-as-use, is more closely tied to the realities of the user's context. However, this should not go beyond speculation since research on value as use is still limited.
Value may emerge not only in purchase and use situations, but also in the disuse or dispossession of a product. Sometimes, the conscious act of not owning or not using a product has a value for its user too. For example, the choice not to own a mobile phone can be of value to people, as it can make them inaccessible and can give them control over their time. Owning but not using certain products can be of value as well. For example, many women are proud of the fact that they always cook at home, and that they do so without using many gadgets. For them, the convenience some small appliances might provide would take away from the sense of fulfilling the role of being a good mother and caregiver. 
Parasuraman (1997) hypothesizes that value can also vary over time as the level of experience users have with a product alters. As users move from being what he calls first-time to short-term and long-term users, their value assessment criteria may change. Obviously, their experience with a product will change, as "every experience both takes up something from those which have gone before and modifies in some way the quality of those which come after" (Dewey, 1938, p. 34). The prior experience and knowledge that users have in relation to a product might be especially relevant factors in their value assessment of products with a high learning curve, such as information products. 
Multidimensional
Based on the definition of value as experience, Holbrook (1999) identifies three dimensions on a continuum characterizing user value, which are (1) intrinsic-extrinsic, (2) self-oriented versus other-oriented, and (3) active-reactive. 
The intrinsic-extrinsic dimension relates to whether a product is valued as an end per se because of its qualities, or for the means or functions it offers that help users accomplish certain ends. For example, a product such as Stark's Juicy Salif is usually assigned intrinsic value, because it is appreciated as an end in itself, rather than as a means for squeezing lemons. A self-oriented versus other-oriented distinction corresponds to whether a product is valued because of its benefit to the user or because of the reactions it draws from others. A car, for example, has a self-oriented value because its functional qualities bring certain benefits, such as convenient transportation or safety, to its user, but it also has other-oriented value because it signifies social status and evokes reactions from others. Finally, the active-reactive dimension represents a distinction regarding whether there is a manipulation of a product by the user or vice versa. Art objects, for example, have a reactive value, because their benefit results from passive admiration. A drill, on the other hand, has an active value because its benefit arises from the user actively interacting with the product.
Types of User Value 
To make things more complicated, it should be noted that different types of value might emerge from users' experiences with products. For example, within the framework of Holbrook's (1999) axiological taxonomy, based on the three dimensions presented above, we can recognize a variety of different value types. These are: efficiency, excellence, play, aesthetics, status, esteem, ethics, and spirituality values (Table 2). In my own study of kitchens, with participants from Turkey and the United States (Boztepe, in press), I identified four major categories of user value: (1) utility, (2) social significance, (3) emotional, and (4) spiritual values (Figure 1).
Table 2. Types of User Value (Adapted from Holbrook (1999))


Figure 1. Categories of User Value.
Utility Value 
Utility value refers to the utilitarian consequences of a product, for example the fact that it might enable the accomplishment of a physical or cognitive task. It encompasses the values of convenience, economy, and quality as sub-categories. In practice, convenience is defined in various ways that include concepts such as accessibility, appropriateness, avoidance of unpleasantness, or compatibility to the local context rather than just as a matter of saving time and effort. For example, rather than as a means for economizing time, Turkish women use a refrigerator as a tool for reordering and managing time. They use it for storing elaborate homemade dishes in semi-prepared form or extra homemade pastries for later use. This is not saving time per se, but rather shifting cooking activity to a different time slot. Note that the notion of managing time involves relocating time as desired instead of reducing the time it takes to accomplish an activity. 
Economy value is concerned with the economic benefits provided by products. These benefits include, but are not limited to, purchase economy, such as can be provided by low prices or flexible installment plans. While these are important, the long-term effects of a product on the family budget, or the economy-in-use, are an even more important value for users. For instance, American participants in the kitchen study primarily viewed their refrigerators as a means to beat high prices and save money through bulk buying and by taking advantage of special offers such as buy-one-get-one-free or family value packs. Value as quality can be broadly defined as an appreciation of a product for its inherent superiority, such as might be found in the durability of materials used to make the product.
Social Significance Value
Social significance value refers to the socially oriented benefits attained through ownership of and experience with a product. These include attainment of social prestige and construction and maintenance of one's identity. People use goods as markers of their relative position in the social nexus (Bourdieu, 1979/1984; Veblen, 2001). Even the most ordinary goods may develop into symbols, and people may interact with them in several ways to achieve social prestige and to maintain face (Goffman, 1967, 1974). Goffman views the self as a social construction, and the notion of face, "the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact" (p. 5), is one way of viewing it as such. Mere possession of a trendy object is often seen as sufficient to communicate a certain image of self. 
The value of products as a means of achieving distinction from others through projection of an image one wishes to create, or through what Goffman (1959) calls impression management, however, is not related to the static ownership of products only and their use as labels, but also to how they are being utilized and what ends are achieved through their use. As Goffman notes, members, to use his term, employ a series of well-choreographed techniques in an attempt to control the impressions they form on others, just as an actor presents a character to an audience. Note that earlier the value of a refrigerator in the Turkish context was seen specifically in terms of its ability to enable time shifting through advance preparation and storage of homemade foods. From the perspective of social significance value, then, the same phenomenon here generates a reality of a kind in the eyes of the participants' visitors such that the hosts are always well-prepared for unexpected guests. 
Emotional Value
Emotional value refers to the affective benefits of a product for people who interact with it, benefits such as pleasure or fun. Such benefits arise from affective experiences, which, according to Desmet and Hekkert (2007), occur on three levels: (1) aesthetic, referring to delight experienced in a sensory capacity, (2) meaning, referring to experiences that relate to one's personality or character, and (3) emotion, referring to the provocation of strong feelings such as love, anger, etc. While Norman (2004) describes the ascription of emotional value primarily as a psychological phenomenon, Desmet and Hekkert (2007) emphasize the context-dependent nature of affective experiences. For example, local perceptions of aesthetics might affect what users define as beautiful or pleasurable. These perceptions are sometimes driven by trends and fashions, which may also differ from one location to another. For example, small toy-like appliances in pastel colors prevail in Turkish households, where they are considered beautiful and pleasing, whereas American countertop appliances communicate an image of power, through an industrial look and capacity. Many of the American participants in the kitchen study mentioned that it is not just an issue of looks, but that they derive great pleasure from using powerful appliances, an experience that makes them feel like professionals. Emotional value is not only derived from the sensorial delight provided by the visual or kinesthetic qualities of products but also from the meanings ascribed to them. For example, American participants in the study invested effort in increasing the emotional value of their refrigerators and making them more pleasurable by adding magnets, children's drawings, and family photographs to the outside: "Each time I see my kids, my family…how much they have grown, it makes me happy," said one participant. Here, the happiness is derived not from the visual quality of the drawings and photos, but from their associations and meanings for the user.
Spiritual Value
Finally, spiritual value refers to spiritual benefits such as good luck and sacredness that are enabled by a product. For example, a spiritual element was discernible in the decoration of refrigerators in Turkish households. Many had nazar boncuğu (evil eye) magnets or stickers on the refrigerator doors, a symbol that is believed to guard against evil associated with envious or covetous eyes. (In Turkish culture, it is believed that the envy of others can cause harm, whether intentionally or not.) Also, many kitchens had bereket jars, a Turkish symbol for fertility and abundance, which contain samples of food that one wishes to be always abundant in the house. Other examples show that communication technologies are increasingly becoming enablers of spiritual experiences too. For instance, several websites have been set up that serve Muslims who live away from their home countries, allowing them to pay online and have sacrifices made on their behalf during Eid ul-Adha.
Of course, these value categories are not mutually exclusive, and the same experience with a product can impart different categories of value simultaneously and to varying degrees. For example, the emotional value most Turkish users aspire to create through decorating their refrigerators also generates convenience value by protecting the refrigerators from dust. On the other hand, there also seems to be the potential for trade-offs between different value types. For example, the social rewards and pleasure of preparing coffee manually might be preferred to the convenience provided by an electric coffee maker. So the question becomes, what are the mechanisms of compromise between different value categories and how do some value categories become foregrounded on a daily basis?
Design and User Value
For Cagan and Vogel (2002), design creates what they call value opportunity classes; that is, properties such as emotional appeal, aesthetics, identity, ergonomics, impact, core technology, and quality, which contribute to the overall experience of a product and relate to its value. They argue that the higher a product scores on each class the greater its value to users. But what Cagan and Vogel are putting forward as design's contribution toward creating these properties is still somehow vague. 
In user-product interactivity, according to Jensen (2001), users form a relationship between certain product properties and the benefits they desire from a product. It is essential then that products have sufficient visible cues to signal their potential value to users. These cues are different from the semiotic or Baudrillardian codes, as they are not totally independent of a product's formal or functional characteristics. They do reside in the object, but are interpreted by the subject. Product properties are treated as cues, or indicators, of value. Through their visible and intrinsic characteristics, they convey certain uses and meanings, which are constantly matched and compared against the requirements of the user's context. My findings support the view that user value is created as a result of the harmonious combination of product properties and what users and their local contexts bring to the interaction with the product. In responding to the question of what constituted the source of value for them, participants often indicated specific product properties. In other words, on the face of it, they equated the source of value with the product properties themselves. In responding to the question of how a specific product property constituted the source of value, however, they often assumed the context of product use, and explained how that property fit into their behaviors, daily habits, etc. Zeithaml (1988) distinguishes between intrinsic or extrinsic cues or signals. Intrinsic cues are related to the physical configuration of a product. Extrinsic cues, on the other hand, are product-related but not part of the product, such as brand name, price, and level of advertising. Contrary to the colloquial belief that brand and price are the key factors in the assignment of value, Zeithaml suggests that users rely more on the intrinsic cues, except when these are not available or when their evaluation requires too much effort or time. However, the cues that motivate a customer's initial purchase of a product may differ from the criteria that connote value during use. 
Design uses all available means, including form, color, texture, materials, affordances, symbols and metaphors, as such cues to communicate value. However, claiming that design creates value perhaps would be an overstatement and would be falling into the trap of the objectivist views discussed earlier. Design starts with the intention to generate value and it has the characteristic of persuasiveness, as Buchanan (1985) puts it. 
Heskett (2002b) talks about "the interplay between designers' intentions and users' needs, perceptions, and goals" (p. 54). So, developing the capacity of objects for value is perhaps a better definition of design's role in value creation. In developing that capacity, designers' heightened understanding of users' contexts and their reasons for and methods of imbuing objects with different types of value is essential. 
Tools for User Value Research
In the early 1980s, several inventories, such as Values and Lifestyles (VALS), were developed to measure consumer value (Woodrudff & Gardial, 1996). The claim of such methods is to segment people according to their enduring beliefs. VALS, for example, consists of categories such as innovators, achievers, thinkers, etc. While these categories have their basis in reality, they are highly stereotypical and concerned only with generalities. Such groupings can help designers establish the general positioning of a product, but they fall short in helping designers identify details that make the difference in people's experiences with the product. 
Other tools, which have also been developed in the marketing field, build on the means-end model, such as Gutman's (1982) laddering method. They suggest that product attributes, which take place on the bottom of a means-end chain, are linked to psychological or social payoffs at the highest level. These methods are based on the assumption that values (i.e., the deeply held and enduring beliefs regarding what is right or wrong) drive the selection and use of products. The means-end approach could be a significant means to track how basic product characteristics such as color, form, texture, etc. can lead to practical or social benefits of a highly abstract nature. Yet, this approach treats value assignment as a cognitive process and psychographic phenomenon and does not sufficiently account for contextual factors. It has already been mentioned that value can change from one context to another. Therefore, research on value cannot afford to ignore situational and cultural contexts. Swidler (1986) suggests a shift of focus from values as the ultimate determinant of the ends to what she calls the tool-kit of habits, skills, styles, and beliefs from which people construct strategies of action. People in different parts of the world may share common values while they continue to exhibit different behaviors and experiences with products. Understanding users' goals is essential, but the same goals can be achieved in many different ways. So, if we build on the notion of value as experience, we should also look at these various ways of doing things, since experiences are attained through activities, among other things. By examining the activities surrounding the use of a product, it is possible to learn much more about the specific ways through which the product leads to desirable consequences. As Parasuraman (1997) states, perhaps the construct of value is so complex and involves so many variables that no single measurement scale would be sufficient for capturing it. Therefore, a range of tools, from more open-ended ethnographic investigations to specific cognitive scales, are needed to deal with the slippery concept of value. 
Conclusion
This paper has barely touched upon the surface of a vast topic and has raised more questions than it has answered. Having a subject as complex and as multidimensional as this, and a research discipline as young as design, the questions that deserve research attention are so many. One of the key areas research should focus on is the dynamics of value assignment. For that, there is a need for more empirical studies, since much of the development on the issue of user value has been conceptual. Ethnographic research focusing in depth on value assignment for each value category and for different product groups is particularly needed for building a fuller understanding of the complexities of the contextual nature of user value assignment. For example, further research involving different products could shed more light on the role of product properties in the assignment of value. Does the value assignment change for different product categories? How do certain product properties become salient? What are the structural and cognitive characteristics of value assignment? 
Similarly, further research could unveil some patterns regarding the context dependency of different product categories. The effect of user context on value may call for special attention, especially with respect to the internationalization of products, and the design of ubiquitous, social, and collaborative computing solutions. In a similar vein, although this study has provided an overview of what different value types are and how different local elements play a role in users' value assignment, we need to trace the issue further and to look at the different value categories in more depth. Also, we need a better understanding of how value changes at different stages of interaction with a product. Are there predictable triggers that lead to value change? To what extent can context be predictable?
Yet we must not forget that building an understanding of the complexities and mechanisms of user value would not be sufficient alone. Design is action-oriented. As Simon (1996) defines it, design aims to change the existing situation into a preferred one. Therefore, particular design research effort is needed for developing tools and methods applicable in design practice that would enable designers to be active in enhancing value creation. In other words, theories of "middle range" (Merton, 1968) are needed to link theories and the daily practical issues of designers. The next step in user-centered design then becomes how designers deliver user value. Even this brief review of some models of user value shows that achieving such ambitious goals is not an easy task, and may be only possible from a multi–disciplinary perspective and by putting under scrutiny design knowledge, skills, and methods.
