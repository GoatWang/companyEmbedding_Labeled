FTI Technology Receives Highest Product Score for Ringtail in Legal Review, One of Three Use Cases, in the 2015 Gartner Critical Capabilities for E-Discovery Report

WASHINGTON, Oct.  13, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN), the global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations protect and enhance their enterprise value, today announced that Gartner has given the Company the highest product score for its Ringtail® e-discovery software in the Legal Review Use Case in Gartner’s ‘Critical Capabilities for E-Discovery’ report (Jie Zhang, Garth Landers, October 6, 2015). Twenty e-discovery software providers were evaluated in the inaugural report, and a complimentary copy is available at the FTI Technology site.
According to the report, “Legal review is viewed as the core part of e-discovery and can be the most costly; it is not measured by technology spend, rather by legal cost (labor of legal professionals and services). Intuitive user interface and ease of use for legal users are important for the review capability. Predictive coding is typically an embedded feature of review technology.”
“On behalf of the global FTI Technology team, we are pleased to receive the highest product score for legal review software in Gartner’s new ‘Critical Capabilities for E-Discovery’ report,” said Seth Rierson, Senior Managing Director and Global Segment Leader of FTI Technology. “Like Gartner, we view ease of use and innovative features as the keys to reducing legal review costs. We’re proud of our software development team’s demonstrated innovation and advancements in these areas and how Ringtail is helping users reduce the total cost of review.”
The Ringtail e-discovery platform supports law firms and corporate legal teams of all sizes that are tasked with managing the complexity and scope of today’s global e-discovery. A full-featured platform, Ringtail software processes and culls data, provides a broad range of tools for quick data review and coding and gives users a comprehensive set of redaction and production tools. Ringtail also features patented visual analytics, concept clustering, predictive coding and advanced workflows. Ringtail is available on-premises, on-demand or in a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) deployment model. For more information on FTI Technology, Ringtail, or to schedule a Ringtail demo, please visit www.ftitechnology.com.

History and Acquisitions[edit]
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide expert witnesses for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.[9][5]
Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as FCN.[10][11] After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."[5]
The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients. FTI Consulting purchased PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. Business Recovery Services Division ("BRS") for $250 million in 2002, which at the time was the largest provider of bankruptcy, turnaround and business restructuring services in the United States.[12][13] The company purchased KPMG's Dispute Advisory Services in 2003.[14] The company purchased Chicago-based Compass Lexecon in 2003, maintaining the name as a subsidiary.[15]
FTI acquired Ringtail Solutions Group in 2005.[16] Ringtail's signature product, the Ringtail Discovery Software Suite, provides e-discovery and document management tools to assist corporations and law firms during litigation engagements. FTI acquired Attenex Corporation in 2008[17] and merged Attenex Patterns with Ringtail Discovery Software Suite to form Ringtail 8 E-discovery Software.[18]
In 2006 the company acquired the London-based communications consultancy Financial Dynamics ("FD").[19] FD is now referred to as the Strategic Communications Division of FTI. In 2007, FTI expanded into Latin America and reported $1 billion USD in annual revenue for the first time.[11][20]
In 2008, FTI purchased the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York, and Forensic Accounting, a forensic accounting practice based in the UK.[21] In 2010, FS Asia Advisory Limited was acquired in Hong Kong, expanding FTI's activities in Asia.[22] In January 2014, FTI Consulting acquired London-based TLG Partners, which produced a series of annual thought leader indexes.[23][24][25] In the same month, Steven H. Gunby was named the firm's new president and chief executive officer.[26]
In 2015, The Deal named FTI Consulting the world's top restructuring adviser to distressed companies.[27] In 2016, the company led the list of the International Who’s Who of Commercial Arbitration for the sixth consecutive year.[28]
Services[edit]
FTI Consulting is organized into five business segments. The first, Corporate Finance and Restructuring, provides business turnaround services, including support for restructuring, litigation, insolvency, and interim management. The second, Economic Consulting, provides economic analysis and expert testimony for law firms, corporations and government agencies. The third, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, provides investigative data analysis and forensic accounting services for businesses and healthcare systems. The fourth, Strategic Communications, offers public relations services for "clients managing financial, regulatory and reputational challenges." The fifth, Technology, provides specialized software to manage the risks involved in e-discovery.[29]
FTI's employees include specialists in banking, forensic accounting, real estate intellectual property, crisis communication, and construction as well as two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
FTI Consulting has established partnerships with companies and organizations in several fields. It is a member of the World Economic Forum.[31] Some of the company's senior and regional leaders participate in the Forum's meetings, participating in several projects related to anti-corruption, energy and professional services principles.[32]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History and Acquisitions[edit]
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide expert witnesses for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.[9][5]
Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as FCN.[10][11] After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."[5]
The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients. FTI Consulting purchased PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. Business Recovery Services Division ("BRS") for $250 million in 2002, which at the time was the largest provider of bankruptcy, turnaround and business restructuring services in the United States.[12][13] The company purchased KPMG's Dispute Advisory Services in 2003.[14] The company purchased Chicago-based Compass Lexecon in 2003, maintaining the name as a subsidiary.[15]
FTI acquired Ringtail Solutions Group in 2005.[16] Ringtail's signature product, the Ringtail Discovery Software Suite, provides e-discovery and document management tools to assist corporations and law firms during litigation engagements. FTI acquired Attenex Corporation in 2008[17] and merged Attenex Patterns with Ringtail Discovery Software Suite to form Ringtail 8 E-discovery Software.[18]
In 2006 the company acquired the London-based communications consultancy Financial Dynamics ("FD").[19] FD is now referred to as the Strategic Communications Division of FTI. In 2007, FTI expanded into Latin America and reported $1 billion USD in annual revenue for the first time.[11][20]
In 2008, FTI purchased the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York, and Forensic Accounting, a forensic accounting practice based in the UK.[21] In 2010, FS Asia Advisory Limited was acquired in Hong Kong, expanding FTI's activities in Asia.[22] In January 2014, FTI Consulting acquired London-based TLG Partners, which produced a series of annual thought leader indexes.[23][24][25] In the same month, Steven H. Gunby was named the firm's new president and chief executive officer.[26]
In 2015, The Deal named FTI Consulting the world's top restructuring adviser to distressed companies.[27] In 2016, the company led the list of the International Who’s Who of Commercial Arbitration for the sixth consecutive year.[28]
Services[edit]
FTI Consulting is organized into five business segments. The first, Corporate Finance and Restructuring, provides business turnaround services, including support for restructuring, litigation, insolvency, and interim management. The second, Economic Consulting, provides economic analysis and expert testimony for law firms, corporations and government agencies. The third, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, provides investigative data analysis and forensic accounting services for businesses and healthcare systems. The fourth, Strategic Communications, offers public relations services for "clients managing financial, regulatory and reputational challenges." The fifth, Technology, provides specialized software to manage the risks involved in e-discovery.[29]
FTI's employees include specialists in banking, forensic accounting, real estate intellectual property, crisis communication, and construction as well as two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
FTI Consulting has established partnerships with companies and organizations in several fields. It is a member of the World Economic Forum.[31] Some of the company's senior and regional leaders participate in the Forum's meetings, participating in several projects related to anti-corruption, energy and professional services principles.[32]

History and Acquisitions[edit]
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide expert witnesses for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.[9][5]
Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as FCN.[10][11] After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."[5]
The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients. FTI Consulting purchased PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. Business Recovery Services Division ("BRS") for $250 million in 2002, which at the time was the largest provider of bankruptcy, turnaround and business restructuring services in the United States.[12][13] The company purchased KPMG's Dispute Advisory Services in 2003.[14] The company purchased Chicago-based Compass Lexecon in 2003, maintaining the name as a subsidiary.[15]
FTI acquired Ringtail Solutions Group in 2005.[16] Ringtail's signature product, the Ringtail Discovery Software Suite, provides e-discovery and document management tools to assist corporations and law firms during litigation engagements. FTI acquired Attenex Corporation in 2008[17] and merged Attenex Patterns with Ringtail Discovery Software Suite to form Ringtail 8 E-discovery Software.[18]
In 2006 the company acquired the London-based communications consultancy Financial Dynamics ("FD").[19] FD is now referred to as the Strategic Communications Division of FTI. In 2007, FTI expanded into Latin America and reported $1 billion USD in annual revenue for the first time.[11][20]
In 2008, FTI purchased the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York, and Forensic Accounting, a forensic accounting practice based in the UK.[21] In 2010, FS Asia Advisory Limited was acquired in Hong Kong, expanding FTI's activities in Asia.[22] In January 2014, FTI Consulting acquired London-based TLG Partners, which produced a series of annual thought leader indexes.[23][24][25] In the same month, Steven H. Gunby was named the firm's new president and chief executive officer.[26]
In 2015, The Deal named FTI Consulting the world's top restructuring adviser to distressed companies.[27] In 2016, the company led the list of the International Who’s Who of Commercial Arbitration for the sixth consecutive year.[28]
Services[edit]
FTI Consulting is organized into five business segments. The first, Corporate Finance and Restructuring, provides business turnaround services, including support for restructuring, litigation, insolvency, and interim management. The second, Economic Consulting, provides economic analysis and expert testimony for law firms, corporations and government agencies. The third, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, provides investigative data analysis and forensic accounting services for businesses and healthcare systems. The fourth, Strategic Communications, offers public relations services for "clients managing financial, regulatory and reputational challenges." The fifth, Technology, provides specialized software to manage the risks involved in e-discovery.[29]
FTI's employees include specialists in banking, forensic accounting, real estate intellectual property, crisis communication, and construction as well as two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
FTI Consulting has established partnerships with companies and organizations in several fields. It is a member of the World Economic Forum.[31] Some of the company's senior and regional leaders participate in the Forum's meetings, participating in several projects related to anti-corruption, energy and professional services principles.[32]

FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN) Dividend Growth in Spotlight

Pearson Staff Writer |
July 19, 2017 |











FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN) currently has a 10-year dividend growth rate of -99.90%. This number is calculated using the geometric average which provides the typical value of dividend growth over the specified period using the product of their values. The geometric average is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. 
Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates. The stock currently has an 8 year dividend growth rate of -99.90%, a 5 year of -99.90%, and a 3 year of 0.00%.
Free Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN)‘s FCF growth is presently at -0.102044. 
This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 0.569224. 
The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is 5.055167. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred.
 Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of 0.093118, and a 5-year average FCF yield of 0.0758. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.
SMA CrossTechnical traders and investors may be looking at the simple moving average 50/200 cross on shares of FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN). At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 0.85793.
 If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN), gives us a value of 0.721.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 08/03/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

History and Acquisitions[edit]
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide expert witnesses for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.[9][5]
Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as FCN.[10][11] After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."[5]
The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients. FTI Consulting purchased PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. Business Recovery Services Division ("BRS") for $250 million in 2002, which at the time was the largest provider of bankruptcy, turnaround and business restructuring services in the United States.[12][13] The company purchased KPMG's Dispute Advisory Services in 2003.[14] The company purchased Chicago-based Compass Lexecon in 2003, maintaining the name as a subsidiary.[15]
FTI acquired Ringtail Solutions Group in 2005.[16] Ringtail's signature product, the Ringtail Discovery Software Suite, provides e-discovery and document management tools to assist corporations and law firms during litigation engagements. FTI acquired Attenex Corporation in 2008[17] and merged Attenex Patterns with Ringtail Discovery Software Suite to form Ringtail 8 E-discovery Software.[18]
In 2006 the company acquired the London-based communications consultancy Financial Dynamics ("FD").[19] FD is now referred to as the Strategic Communications Division of FTI. In 2007, FTI expanded into Latin America and reported $1 billion USD in annual revenue for the first time.[11][20]
In 2008, FTI purchased the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York, and Forensic Accounting, a forensic accounting practice based in the UK.[21] In 2010, FS Asia Advisory Limited was acquired in Hong Kong, expanding FTI's activities in Asia.[22] In January 2014, FTI Consulting acquired London-based TLG Partners, which produced a series of annual thought leader indexes.[23][24][25] In the same month, Steven H. Gunby was named the firm's new president and chief executive officer.[26]
In 2015, The Deal named FTI Consulting the world's top restructuring adviser to distressed companies.[27] In 2016, the company led the list of the International Who’s Who of Commercial Arbitration for the sixth consecutive year.[28]
Services[edit]
FTI Consulting is organized into five business segments. The first, Corporate Finance and Restructuring, provides business turnaround services, including support for restructuring, litigation, insolvency, and interim management. The second, Economic Consulting, provides economic analysis and expert testimony for law firms, corporations and government agencies. The third, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, provides investigative data analysis and forensic accounting services for businesses and healthcare systems. The fourth, Strategic Communications, offers public relations services for "clients managing financial, regulatory and reputational challenges." The fifth, Technology, provides specialized software to manage the risks involved in e-discovery.[29]
FTI's employees include specialists in banking, forensic accounting, real estate intellectual property, crisis communication, and construction as well as two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
FTI Consulting has established partnerships with companies and organizations in several fields. It is a member of the World Economic Forum.[31] Some of the company's senior and regional leaders participate in the Forum's meetings, participating in several projects related to anti-corruption, energy and professional services principles.[32]

History and Acquisitions[edit]
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide expert witnesses for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.[9][5]
Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as FCN.[10][11] After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."[5]
The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients. FTI Consulting purchased PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. Business Recovery Services Division ("BRS") for $250 million in 2002, which at the time was the largest provider of bankruptcy, turnaround and business restructuring services in the United States.[12][13] The company purchased KPMG's Dispute Advisory Services in 2003.[14] The company purchased Chicago-based Compass Lexecon in 2003, maintaining the name as a subsidiary.[15]
FTI acquired Ringtail Solutions Group in 2005.[16] Ringtail's signature product, the Ringtail Discovery Software Suite, provides e-discovery and document management tools to assist corporations and law firms during litigation engagements. FTI acquired Attenex Corporation in 2008[17] and merged Attenex Patterns with Ringtail Discovery Software Suite to form Ringtail 8 E-discovery Software.[18]
In 2006 the company acquired the London-based communications consultancy Financial Dynamics ("FD").[19] FD is now referred to as the Strategic Communications Division of FTI. In 2007, FTI expanded into Latin America and reported $1 billion USD in annual revenue for the first time.[11][20]
In 2008, FTI purchased the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York, and Forensic Accounting, a forensic accounting practice based in the UK.[21] In 2010, FS Asia Advisory Limited was acquired in Hong Kong, expanding FTI's activities in Asia.[22] In January 2014, FTI Consulting acquired London-based TLG Partners, which produced a series of annual thought leader indexes.[23][24][25] In the same month, Steven H. Gunby was named the firm's new president and chief executive officer.[26]
In 2015, The Deal named FTI Consulting the world's top restructuring adviser to distressed companies.[27] In 2016, the company led the list of the International Who’s Who of Commercial Arbitration for the sixth consecutive year.[28]
Services[edit]
FTI Consulting is organized into five business segments. The first, Corporate Finance and Restructuring, provides business turnaround services, including support for restructuring, litigation, insolvency, and interim management. The second, Economic Consulting, provides economic analysis and expert testimony for law firms, corporations and government agencies. The third, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, provides investigative data analysis and forensic accounting services for businesses and healthcare systems. The fourth, Strategic Communications, offers public relations services for "clients managing financial, regulatory and reputational challenges." The fifth, Technology, provides specialized software to manage the risks involved in e-discovery.[29]
FTI's employees include specialists in banking, forensic accounting, real estate intellectual property, crisis communication, and construction as well as two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
FTI Consulting has established partnerships with companies and organizations in several fields. It is a member of the World Economic Forum.[31] Some of the company's senior and regional leaders participate in the Forum's meetings, participating in several projects related to anti-corruption, energy and professional services principles.[32]
