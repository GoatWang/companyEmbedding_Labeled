Groupon is an American worldwide e-commerce marketplace connecting subscribers with local merchants by offering activities, travel, goods and services in more than 28 countries. Based in Chicago, Groupon was launched in November 2008, and the first market for Groupon was Chicago, followed soon thereafter by Boston, New York City and Toronto. By October 2010 Groupon was available in 150 cities in North America and 100 cities in Europe, Asia and South America, and had 35 million registered users.[3][4][5][6] By the end of March 2015, Groupon served more than 500 cities worldwide, nearly 48.1 million active customers and featured more than 425,000 active deals globally.[7]
The idea for Groupon was created by now-ousted CEO and Pittsburgh native[8] Andrew Mason.[9] The idea subsequently gained the attention of his former employer, Eric Lefkofsky, who provided $1 million in "seed money" to develop the idea. In April 2010, the company was valued at $1.35 billion.[10] According to a December 2010 report conducted by Groupon's marketing association and reported in Forbes magazine and the Wall Street Journal, Groupon was "projecting that the company is on pace to make $1 billion in sales faster than any other business, ever."[8]
In its first earnings release as a public company, Groupon reported a 2011 fourth-quarter loss of $9.8 million on an adjusted basis, disappointing investors.[11] Additional investor concern arose after the company restated 2011 revenues downward in March 2012.[12]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
The idea that would eventually become Groupon was born out of founder Andrew Mason's frustration trying to cancel a cell phone contract in 2006. Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage large number of people's collective bargaining power. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the "tipping point" principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago, until a group of users decided their cause would be saving money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying. Born from The Point, Groupon was launched in November 2008.[13][14][15]
The name Groupon is a blend of “group” and “coupon”. Groupon's first deal was a half-price offer for pizzas at Motel Bar, a restaurant on the first floor of its building in Chicago.[8][16]
The decision to focus on group buying proved wise. In just a year and a half, Groupon grew from a staff of a few dozen to over 350. Revenue and Booking also grew swiftly and the company was valued at over $1 billion after just 16 months in business, the fastest company ever to reach this milestone.[17]
Fueled by its rapid growth, Groupon went public on November 4, 2011. It was the biggest IPO by an Internet company since Google in 2004.[18]
2011 onward[edit]
Prior to the company's fifth anniversary, the Groupon website was completely redesigned and new features were added in November 2013. According to the SVP of product management, the original website was "designed for a deal of the day and the new site is designed for a marketplace." Following the website relaunch, the company rewarded a random selection of one million customers on November 20, 2013 with up to US$5,000 worth of "Groupon bucks".[19][20]
Groupon recorded record-breaking holiday weekend sales in North America during the full (Black Friday through Cyber Monday) weekend of 2014 (Nov. 28 - Dec. 21), representing the most successful four days ever in the company's six-year history, with sales up more than 25% year over year. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were the two biggest days in Groupon's North American history.[21]
Following Amazon.com's December announcement on drone delivery, Groupon reacted with a plan for "Groupon catapults".[22]
On December 29, 2014, Groupon's shares rose by 1.4% after it was reported that Goldman Sachs was "weighing an investment in one of the daily deal company’s units."[23]
Groupon named a new Chief Operating Officer on June 2, 2015, Rich Williams and in November, Williams was named CEO.[24][25]
On September 22, 2015, Groupon announced they would be eliminating approximately 1,100 positions, primarily in their sales and customer service operations.[26] As part of this restructure, they would be ceasing operations in international markets such as Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.
In January 2016, Groupon signed a lease in Seattle for 42,000 square feet of space in the 1201 3rd Avenue building in downtown. This creates room for 400 employees, up from 300 that Groupon currently employs in Washington.[27]
In May 2016, Groupon sued IBM, accusing it of infringing a patent related to technology that helps businesses solicit customers based on the customers' locations at a given moment. Groupon filed its lawsuit on May 9 with the federal court in Chicago, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[28]
In November 2016, Groupon began to reduce its area of coverage from 27 countries down to 15. It shut down operations in South Africa November 4 of that year.[29]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Groupon owns numerous international operations, all of which were originally deal-of-the-day services similar to it, but most of which were subsequently re-branded under the Groupon name after acquisition, including the European-based MyCityDeal (May 17, 2010), the South American ClanDescuento (June 22, 2010), the Japanese service Qpod.jp and Russian Darberry.ru (both acquired on August 17, 2010),[30] and the Singaporean Beeconomic.com (November 30, 2010), which was founded by brothers Karl Chong and Christopher Chong.[31]
Groupon bought the Indian deal-of-the-day website SoSasta.com in January 2011 and re-branded it as "Crazeal by Groupon Inc."[32] The Groupon acquisitions of uBuyiBuy launched services under the Groupon name in Hong Kong.[33] In addition, Groupon acquired GroupsMore.com to expand its business in Malaysia.[34]
Prior to these acquisitions, Groupon had bought out the mobile technology company Mob.ly. The Point, Inc., the predecessor to Groupon, bought the trademark[35] "GROUP-ONS" from its originator in February 2009 under terms which allow the originator and first registrant of the trademark to continue the use of the trademark.
On August 4, 2011, the company acquired Obtiva, a large Chicago, Illinois-based Ruby on Rails and Agile Software Development consulting firm for an undisclosed amount, in order to boost its technology recruiting capabilities.[36][37]
In January 2012, the company acquired Mertado, a social shopping service based on the Facebook platform.[38] In May 2012, Groupon acquired Breadcrumb, a point of sale system and iPad app that targets local restaurants.[39] Based on the May acquisition, Groupon launched Breadcrumb PRO and Breadcrumb POS, expanding its target beyond restaurants to include all types of local businesses.[40]
On September 24, 2012, Groupon acquired restaurant reservation and discount site Savored for an undisclosed amount, providing Groupon with an inlet to higher-end restaurants. Groupon also announced that it would continue to operate Savored independently from the main Groupon website.[41]
In December 2013, Groupon acquired Boomerang, a Lightbank-backed startup that allows people to share gift cards and other deals from local merchants with their friends.[42] Boomerang's two cofounders, Zachary Smith and Matthew Williams, along with eight employees went on to build a new digital-coupon offering, called Groupon Coupons.[43]
On January 11, 2013, Groupon acquired real-time location sharing mobile app and small business service provider Glassmap, which was founded and led by Geoffrey Woo, Jon Zhang and Jonathan Chang.[44] On September 9, 2013, Groupon announced acquisition of European last-minute travel app Blink (founded by Rebeca Minguela), which provides same-day hotel reservations.[45]
On October 2, 2014, Groupon unveiled Snap, a new app specifically for giving customers cash back when they buy certain items at the grocery store. Snap asks shoppers to upload photos of their receipts after they've gone to the supermarket to buy groceries. Certain items are then eligible for discounts, which shoppers receive in the form of a cash-back deal. The new app comes from Groupon's previous acquisition of SnapSaves, a Canadian start-up that works much like Snap.[46]
In November 2014, Groupon acquired In-Store Analytics And Marketing Startup, Swarm Mobile, a startup that helps businesses connect with and track their customers while in stores.[47]
In February 2016, Chinese online retailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd disclosed that it acquired a 5.6% stake in Groupon Inc.[48]
In April 2016, Groupon Inc. announced it received a $250 million investment from a private investment firm, Atairos Management LP, which has ties to Comcast Corp. The firm was founded by former Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis, who launched the firm earlier this year with more than $4 billion in committed capital from Comcast.[49]
In late October 2016, Groupon announced that it is acquiring daily-deals provider LivingSocial.[50]
Business[edit]
Business model[edit]
When it first launched, the company offered one "Groupon" per day in each of the markets it served. The Groupon worked as an assurance contract using ThePoint's platform: if a certain number of people signed up for the offer, then the deal became available to all;[51] if the predetermined minimum was not met, no one got the deal that day.[8] This reduces risk for retailers, who can treat the coupons as quantity discounts[8] as well as sales promotion tools. In the early years before revenue splits began to adjust as necessary, Groupon made money by keeping approximately half the money the customer pays for the coupon. Currently, that split can vary depending on many factors.[8][52][53]
For example, in a 50/50 revenue split, if $240 worth of home painting services are purchased by the consumer for $50 through Groupon, then the business gets $25 and Groupon keeps $25. There are certain businesses to which Groupon initially did not offer its services, including shooting ranges and strip clubs;[54] however, shooting ranges have been featured on Groupon. [55]
Unlike classified advertising, the merchant does not pay any upfront cost to participate:[8] Consumers are able to search and browse deals via web or mobile and can subscribe to receive emails featuring deals they are interested in based on preferences they input.
Groupon employs a large number of copywriters[56] who draft descriptions for the deals featured by email and on the website. Groupon's promotional text for the deals has been seen as a contributing factor to the popularity of the site, featuring a distinctive mix of thorough fact-checking and witty humor.[56]
Groupon's customer base primarily is female and has a college education.[7]
There are potential problems with the business model. For example, a successful deal could temporarily swamp a small business with too many customers, risking a possibility that customers will be dissatisfied, or that there won't be enough product to meet the demand.[8] Gap, a large clothing retailer, was able to handle 445,000 coupons in a national deal (although it experienced server problems at one point), but a smaller business could become suddenly flooded with customers.[8] One coffee shop in Portland, Oregon struggled with an increase in customers for three months, when it sold close to 1,000 Groupons on the one day it was offered, according to one report.[57] In response to similar problems, Groupon officials state that deals sold will be capped in advance to a number that the business can service effectively.[8]
Groupon encourages new customers to try local businesses. 88% of merchants agree that their Groupon deal brought in new customers, and 82% of customers say they are likely to return to the merchant again.[7]
In a 2011 TechCrunch analysis of Groupon, writer Rakesh Agrawal predicted that, over time, Groupon's merchant customer base would contract to only those businesses that could profitably exploit its business model, such as yoga studios or other services that could offer customers long-term subscriptions not bound by the Groupon terms. When the company reported in the second quarter of 2012 that its revenues had declined along with customer growth and the amount of money existing customers spent on the site, Slate tech journalist Farhad Manjoo said Agrawal had been vindicated.[58] Agrawal's prediction, however, did not hold true as a more recent snapshot of the company shows consolidated revenue growing 24% year-over-year in 2014,[21] in conjunction with active customers reaching 48.1 million and active deals reaching more than 425,000 globally.[59]
In 2010, it was reported that local merchants found it difficult to get Groupon interested in agreeing to a particular deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, seven of every eight possible deals suggested by merchants were dismissed by Groupon.[8]
Groupon offers a mobile application available on iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone. It allows users to browse and buy deals on their phones and redeem them using the screen as a coupon. Also Groupon is now a part of several Daily Deal Aggregators, which helps them expand their target audience, gain traffic and increase sales and revenue.
In February 2011, Groupon Russia announced it would join the Russian Company Mail.ru in order to start offering deals on its social network Odnoklassniki. This way, users would be able to buy and share deals from Groupon on their profiles.
In addition to daily local deals, Groupon’s current channels are: Groupon Goods, launched in September 2011, which focuses on discounted merchandise; Groupon Getaways,[60] which offers vacation packages and travel deals; and GrouponLive,[61] where consumers can find discounts on ticketed events—concerts, sporting events, theater, etc. (About Family Vacations recommends Groupon Getaways as an essential travel dealfinding site.) [62]
Groupon has also emerged as a check on price increases for certain essential commodities in many countries. In September 2013, Groupon India announced that it would sell onions for ₹9 ($0.14) per Kg in a sharp contrast to the market price of ₹70-80 per Kg.[63]
In January 2014, Groupon bought ideeli, a fashion company, for $43 million.[64]
In April 2015, Groupon announced it is selling a controlling stake in the Korean online shopping platform, Ticket Monster, to a consortium including Anchor Equity Partners, KKR and TMON management. Groupon will continue to retain a fully diluted 41% minority stake in the company.[65]
On July 16, 2015, Groupon announced its acquisition of food-delivery service OrderUp.[66] Two weeks later, Groupon announced its own Food Delivery Business, Groupon To Go.[67]
Geographic markets[edit]
Groupon breaks into new markets by identifying successful local businesses, first by sending in advance a number of employees to research the local market; when it finds a business with outstanding reviews, salespeople approach it and explain the model, and use social marketing sites such as Facebook to further promote the idea.[8] Groupon serves 500 markets and 15 countries, the many major geographic markets internationally include cites in the United States,[68] Canada,Ukraine, Germany, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia,[69] Ireland, Israel,[70] Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Japan, Turkey, Mexico, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Russia, and South Africa. Groupon and an Australian company, Scoopon.[71] The two companies agreed on an out of court settlement by July 2012.[72]
On February 19, 2011 The Wall Street Journal reported that Groupon was preparing to launch in China.[73][74] Groupon subsequently entered into the China market in a joint venture with Tencent and launched "Gaopeng". After a year of struggling in the established market, Goapeng subsequently merged with Futuan. Groupon is also expanding into the MENA region with its launch of Groupon UAE on June 16, 2011.[75]
Groupon New Zealand launched on 10 May 2011.[citation needed]
Groupon entered the Indian market through the acquisition of local company SoSasta in Jan 2011.[76] The Indian company was renamed Crazeal in Oct 2011 and CEO Ankur Warikoo was placed at the helm.[77] Finally, after winning a battle to acquire the groupon.co.in domain name, the Indian business was renamed Groupon in Nov 2012.[78][79] Groupon India is renamed as Nearbuy from 10 August 2015.[80]
Groupon United Arab Emirates[81] launched on June 15, 2011; Groupon Denmark[82] launched on September 21, 2011; and Groupon Thailand[83] launched on February 27, 2012.
In August 2015, Groupon gave up control of its India unit to Sequoia Capital, the Menlo Park-based venture capital firm. Groupon India is now known as Nearbuy and has a new website and mobile app[84]
In November 2015, Groupon announced it is shutting down business in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Groupon also recently closed in countries including Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.[85]
Competitors[edit]
Direct[edit]
Worldwide, there are over 500 sites similar to Groupon, including over 100 in the United States.[8][10] However, by December 2010, only one competitor, LivingSocial, had been described as a serious competitor; they used the same business model- Transaction fee model; according to one estimate, it received an investment from Amazon of $175 million.[8] Other notable firms that operate to provide consumer deals include, Plum district, Jasmere.com, Ebates, FatWallet, RetailMeNot, meerkatmall.com, chi-spree.com and NetBarg the first group buying platform in Iran.[86][87]
In 2011, after reports surfaced on the subject,[88] Google launched a competing product, called Google Offers, following its failure to purchase Groupon for $6 billion.[89]
In April 2011, Facebook began testing a social-buying program.[90] This move was speculated to be a competitive threat to Groupon, but Facebook ended the project by August 2011.[91]
In October 2011, Adlibrium announced Adlibrium Dailies, the first free daily deal service for merchants which, according to estimates, reaches nearly 4 million consumers via email and mobile combined.[92]
The growth of Groupon buying also created an increase of "deal comparison websites" such as Amazon Local. Amazon announced it was closing down Amazon Local in November 2015.[93]
As of December 2015, Chinese startup unicorn Meituan is the largest player in the daily deals space. Its recent valuation is approximately $7 billion.[94]
Indirect[edit]
As Groupon looks to expand beyond daily deals to become a marketplace for local commerce, the company comes into competition with many large players. Groupon Goods competes with Amazon. Facebook is testing "Local Market", a buying and selling community powered by Facebook groups, that also indirectly competes with Groupon. "Local" is a hard nut to crack, and while many players seek to find a foothold in the space, Groupon continues to have a significant advantage because of its relationships with 150,000 local businesses in the United States alone.[95]
Financials[edit]
New Enterprise Associates, Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell are investors in Groupon (Lefkofsky and Keywell later formed the investment company Lightbank; Groupon is listed as a Lightbank investment).[96] In April 2010, Groupon raised $135 million from Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm.[97] On December 29, 2010, Groupon's executive board approved a change to Groupon's certificate of incorporation that would permit the company to raise $950 million in venture capital funding, based on a valuation of $6.4 billion.[98] On June 2, 2011, Groupon filed to go public under the ticker symbol GRPN. The IPO was handled by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse Group.
From January 2010 through January 2011, Groupon’s U.S. monthly revenues grew from $11 million to $89 million. Consolidated revenue for the full year 2014 reached nearly $3.2 billion.[21]
In October 2010, Yahoo! was rumored to have offered over $3 billion to acquire Groupon.[99] On November 30, 2010, it was reported that Google offered $5.3 billion with a $700 million earnout to acquire Groupon and was rejected on December 3, 2010.[100] After the rejection of the Google/Groupon buy-out, Groupon proceeded with their own initial public offering.
Groupon’s consolidated gross billings for the full year 2014 increased 32% year-over-year to $7.6 billion.[21]
In early November 2012, Groupon reported they had missed their third quarter revenue estimates, posting a revenue of $586.6 million while estimates were at $591 million. This caused Groupon's stocks to fall to as low as $2.93/share early in the trading day. Groupon has said to have lost 80% of its value since its initial public offering over one year ago.[101] The stock has since rebounded and was trading around $8 in Q1 2015 before plunging as low as $2.15 in early 2016.[102]
Groupon Now application[edit]
In 2011, Groupon developed an application, Groupon Now, aimed at smartphone and tablet users. The application consists of two buttons: "I'm Hungry" and "I'm Bored.” Once a user clicks on one of the buttons, the app then locates the closest and best deals for food or entertainment, respectively, using geolocation.[103]
Groupon Promise[edit]
Groupon have the Groupon Promise to ensure that customers are satisfied with their purchase and if customers are disappointed with their purchase, Groupon will try to work things out with the customers or give them a refund.[104]
Groupon VIP[edit]
On February 20, 2012, Groupon announced a "VIP Membership" program, with a membership fee of $30 annually.[105] This program gives VIP members access to deals 12 hours earlier than non-members, as well as access to expired deals (in the "Deal Vault") and easy returns of deals (in exchange for "Groupon bucks").
Groupon MerchantOS[edit]
Groupon MerchantOS is a suite of products and tools for merchants running with Groupon. The suite includes Groupon Rewards, Groupon Scheduler and Groupon Payments.
Groupon Rewards On May 10, 2012, Groupon announced the launch of Groupon Rewards in the United States. Rewards is a loyalty program for merchants to reward customers for repeat visits with a Reward of their choosing. Unlike “buy 9 and get the 10th free” punchcards, a consumer earns Rewards by using any major credit card saved in their Groupon account when they visit their favorite local merchants. When a customer spends an amount pre-determined by the merchant, the customer unlocks a Reward to use on a future visit.[106][107] The rewards program was later removed due to lack of engineering support.[108]
Groupon Scheduler Groupon Scheduler is an online booking tool for merchants, allowing their consumers to seamlessly book appointments for services at the time of purchasing their Groupon deal. This tool is targeted at merchants running deals where appointments are required, for example in the healthy and beauty industry or for classes and activities.[109]
Groupon Payments The newest addition to the suite of merchant-facing products is Groupon Payments, which was launched in September 2012. Groupon Payments offers merchants an infrastructure for accepting credit card payments at a low cost.[110]
As of December 2015, MerchantOS is no longer a Groupon division.
Reception[edit]
Super Bowl commercial[edit]
Groupon aired a controversial Super Bowl XLV advertisement in which actor Timothy Hutton begins by making a plea for the people of Tibet before delivering the punch line: "But they still whip up an amazing fish curry."[111] Critics of the ad took to several social media outlets[112] to argue that Groupon was using the plight of Tibetans to sell their services. The following day, Groupon responded by defending their commercial and their philanthropic stance.[113][114]
The environmental organization Greenpeace praised Groupon's Super Bowl ads.[112][115] On February 10, 2011, Groupon's founder Andrew Mason apologized and pulled the ad.[116]
Violation of gift certificate expiration laws[edit]
In March 2011, Eli R. Johnson filed a lawsuit in federal court against Groupon, based on a claim that the company issues "gift certificates" that are not allowed under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act. The act prohibits retailers from setting expiration dates less than 5 years after a card is purchased.[117] The class action lawsuit was settled on December 17, 2012.[118]
Initial public offering filing[edit]
Some analysts claim that Groupon operates "like" a Ponzi scheme, according to interpretation of 2011 Initial public offering (IPO) documentation, because at the time it publicly disclosed that it is losing approximately US$100 million per quarter, had a net negative balance of $230 million, and used later investors' money to pay off earlier investors.[119] However, Groupon earned nearly $3.2 billion in consolidated revenue in 2014 and had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2014.[21]
On August 10, 2011, Groupon updated its IPO filing, after facing scrutiny from regulators and analysts over its use of a non-standard accounting metric called Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income. Critics argued that ACSOI was used by Groupon to present a misleading metric of profitability. Groupon's original IPO filing with ACSOI accounting showed a positive operating income of $60.6 million for 2010; after replacing the ACSOI metric with standard accounting metrics, Groupon's IPO filing reported an operating loss of $420 million for 2010.[120]
Analysts also criticized Groupon's decision to pay out over $940 million of the $1.12 billion in venture capital Groupon had raised before the IPO - over 84% of its venture capital raised - as cash payouts to its 3 founders and early backers, rather than into the money-losing company. Co-founder Eric Lefkofsky alone received over $300 million in early 2011, just weeks before the company filed its IPO paperwork.[121] The large cash payout also made Groupon technically insolvent when it filed for its IPO.[122]
On October 21, 2011, Groupon set terms for its IPO on NASDAQ, planning to offer 30 million shares at $16–18. The terms implied a dealsize of $510 million and a valuation of $11.2 billion. On November 4, Groupon raised $700 million, 30 percent more than it sought, valuing them at about $12.7 billion.
As of 4 November 2011 Groupon was valued at $13 billion and the float was at 35 million shares going at $20 each whereas they were last priced at between $16 and $18.[123] On their opening on Nasdaq, Groupon shares jumped more than 50 percent to a high of $29.52.[124] However, on November 22, 2011 the stock price fell below its IPO level.[125]
On Wednesday, July 11, 2012, just eight months after the company went public, Groupon's stock hit its lowest level since IPO at $7.72 and closed at $7.77.[126] On Tuesday, August 14, 2012, Groupon's stock price dropped 27% and fell as low as $5.49.[127] On Tuesday, September 3, 2012, Groupon's stock price closed at another all-time low at $4.15 dropping almost 80% below Groupon's IPO price ($20).[128]
Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission[edit]
In March 2011, the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission notified Groupon that it was in violation of state law that prohibits discounting of alcoholic beverages. Groupon notified Massachusetts subscribers of a temporary suspension in the use of its discount vouchers for alcohol at participating restaurants.[129]
UK Office of Fair Trading investigation[edit]
During 2011 there were reported breaches of British advertising regulations to the Advertising Standards Authority.[130] In December 2011 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) launched an investigation into Groupon after the firm broke regulations 48 times in 11 months.[131]
The OFT concluded in March 2012 that Groupon was in "widespread breaches" of UK consumer laws[132] and were ordered to "clean up their practices" within three months including ensuring its website was accurate, realistic, claims related to any beauty or health products offered were substantiated and that refund and cancellation policies were in accordance with current regulations.[133]
Live Off Groupon[edit]
In May 2010, Groupon created a challenge to live off Groupons for one year. The contestant Josh Stevens traveled throughout the United States and to the United Kingdom and purchased all food, drinks, travel, entertainment and more from Groupon for 365 days. At the end of the year, he received a prize of $100,000.[134]
Presence in China[edit]
Groupon has moderate online presence in China, where Meituan.com and Dianping.com control most of the market share. Due to various economic factors and regulatory framework in China, local companies are more prevalent than Groupon, just as Baidu and Renren control a larger market share than do Google and Facebook.[135]
Media related[edit]

Friend Me, a CBS sitcom based around Groupon was created in 2012, but never aired and was cancelled in 2013[136]

【Groupon 掰掰！】團購界霸主大意失荊州，只因為飢餓行銷玩過了頭Posted on 2015/09/23 
  TO 精選觀點 



《TO》導讀：Groupon 撤出台灣引起巨大風波，其實 Groupon 在全球佈局都受到阻礙，其中有個原因就是飢餓行銷玩過了頭，又得同時面對眾多競爭者的挑戰，才讓財務黑洞越滾越大。
本文轉載自  書廷理財日記 部落格，作者林書廷 20 歲即加入創業與投資領域耕耘，以一個市場觀察者的角度分析 Groupon 的經營策略到底哪裡出問題，才導致今天的衰敗。
Groupon 源自 Group(群體)+coupon(餐券)，2008 年創立於美國芝加哥，至今已經擴展到 49 個國家、500 多個城市。
近幾年來是全球最大的 優惠券團購網站。因為每天都有超殺的低價優惠券販售，本來要 1000 元的牛排，變得只要 400 元就可以買到，完全顛覆了消費者的世界，推出時可說是紅極一時、擴張極快。


2010 年 GROUPON 進軍台灣 

2010 年 12 月，Groupon 公司來到台灣，一口氣買下地圖日記及百萬網友團購網，(百萬團購網是台灣第八家的優惠券網站) 正式成立【台灣酷朋網】，像是餐廳、SPA 美容、宅配商品、旅遊… 等，全部都可以用優惠券的方式買到，而且強調，優惠券未使用可全額退費，所以真的是掀起一股台灣的優惠券旋風。

當時朋友們的話題都是最新優惠，特別是台灣人最愛吃了，餐廳餐券買再多都覺得划算，很多時候也怕優惠不再，不少人會先買一堆餐券存放，以後再慢慢用。

 

硬性壓縮廠商利潤， 導致方向逐漸走歪 

飢餓行銷 (限時搶購)+ 超殺優惠，帶給了消費者前所未有的好處，但是這麼便宜的優惠券到底是怎麼來的呢？以牛排館為例好了，老闆原本牛排賣 100 塊，酷朋要求老闆賣半價 50 塊，而且賣出後，老闆只能拿到其中 25 塊！
當下老闆肯定要哭了，因為一塊牛排成本 30 塊，豈不是越賣越虧？
此時酷朋公司的業務員會說：
「老闆你不能這樣想，你看你現在餐廳有坐滿嗎？有多少空位？這些服務生有很忙嗎？
反正空著也是空著，不賺白不賺。」
「雖然老闆你收到的錢不足成本，但你就當是花了一點點廣告費， 一個客人只要 5 元 (成本 30- 實拿 25)，未來口碑相傳，肯定讓你業績暴漲。」
通常這時候老闆只會猛點頭，然後答應。一開始生意會很不錯 (價格越殺越好)，但是優惠券的兌換期是六個月，當熱鬧的六個月過去以後，餐廳往往又恢復到冷清的時代。低廉價格的背後，肯定有犧牲者，這犧牲者就是被壓榨到極點的廠商。

所謂上有政策，下有對策，被壓榨到極致的廠商於是出怪招。明明原價 100 元的牛排，廠商或許就打說『150 元下殺 70 元』。又或者是一樣一份牛排，一般顧客是 8 盎司，用優惠券的顧客就被偷偷縮水成 6 盎司。

 

不健康的營運狀況， 迫使酷朋淡出市場 

1. 當商品有疑慮，顧客信心下降， 團購券的市場就受到了影響。
2. 越來越多的團購平台上線，紅海市場將顧客人潮分散。
3. 廠商發現長期沒好處，於是優質廠商漸漸選擇不合作。
所以整個熱潮開始的快，但也在一兩年之內快速退潮。漸漸的，公司營運狀況也不如開始，在 2011 年 GROUPON 公司申請上市後，當下必須提供公司財務報告，大家才發現公司財務槓桿高得離譜，擁有 2.9 億現金資產，卻背負 5.2 億短期負債！
也就是說一個人銀行只有 2 萬 9，卻在外面欠人家 5 萬 2，如果債主同時來要錢，那肯定要跑路了！
因此公司的股價表現上，其實很不理想。

 
終於到了 2015.9.21，GROUPON 集團受不了營運壓力，決定在台灣酷朋裁員 100 人，並向正式宣布退出台灣市場。
短短五年的酷朋台灣，可以說是風風雨雨，但也成為台灣小資族心目中難忘的記憶。

故事的背後，我想有 2 個重點：
1. 多贏的生意才能長久 ，一味的壓低價的紅海競爭法，總會有一個犧牲者壓垮這個結構。
2. 必須創造真正的價值 ，人們除了喜歡低價，其實也在乎服務，創造獨有的服務價值是重要關鍵，更能讓客戶買單，也同時保有廠商利潤。
不論結果如何，我覺得這是間厲害的公司，它的確打造了一個時代，也肯定會成為經濟學必談的教材案例，更會成為台灣小資族們共同的回憶。

      		Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN): Product Innovation Alive And Well But Traffic Headwinds Impacting Q1      	

            
          Published By News Desk at March 9, 2017 01:05 pm          
          

          The firm expects product innovation to emerge as a key theme for Groupon in 2H17 and 2018          

Credit Suisse hosted a meeting with Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) CFO Mike Randolfi and IR Deb Schwartz in Chicago on Wednesday. The firm’s discussions centered on a 1Q update, product innovation and 2017 marketing investments. For the stock, Groupon indicated that 1Q traffic headwinds will likely result in 1Q EBITDA headwinds, which the firm thinks will weigh on sentiment near-term.






Groupon indicated that 1Q traffic trends are volatile owing due to unspecified reasons, and 1Q EBITDA will likely be flat vs. last year. Credit Suisse’s model assumes 1Q EBITDA of $48.6mn vs. $31.3mn last year. Groupon reiterated its 2017 EBITDA outlook of $200- $240mn so the cadence of EBITDA will be more back-end loaded.
Groupon is working on several products aimed at increasing purchase frequency and reducing transaction friction (redemption and cashless payments) incl. card linked offers and Beauty Now (sub-brand for searching, scheduling and paying for health, beauty and wellness category). Both card linked offers and Beauty Now will likely be rolled out in additional cities in 2H17. Also, Credit Suisse anticipates Groupon will leverage some of the underlying technology from card linked offers in its core business in 2018 and beyond to remove friction from the payment and redemption process. The firm expects product innovation to emerge as a key theme for Groupon in 2H17 and 2018.
While Credit Suisse is positive on Groupon's strategic focus on disciplined customer acquisition, optimizing its Int'l footprint and improving shopping margins, the firm remains Neutral on Groupon shares given muted gross profit growth in 2017/2018; potential for take rate compression; looming competition from FB; and near term volatile traffic trends.

10 Pros and Cons of Using Groupon


Group buying may be all the rage among consumers. But does is really make good business sense? Yes it can if you design the promotion just right for your company.

Groupon, the group buying site offering daily deals, has proven to be wildly popular with consumers. Great discounts are given for restaurants, retail stores, spas, theaters and much more. What's more appealing than scoring a $100 massage for $25 or grabbing a meal valued at $50 for $15? People love discounts, especially during hard times when money is tight. Investors also are enamored with Groupon. Google famously offered to buy the site for $6 billion but got rejected. Now all eyes are on the Chicago-based firm to file for an initial public offering before the year ends. A Groupon IPO will likely generate a fortune for early investors, according to market analysts. Launched in 2008, Groupon is a fast growing company, having transformed the world of online shopping. It has boosted the number of markets where it operates to 500 and has 70 million subscribers. It has a staff of 1,500 working at locations in cities throughout the U.S. and across 29 countries. The company is rumored to have generated $760 million in revenue for 2010, up from $33 million in 2009. Who's not loving Groupon? It appears to be merchants. A study by Rice University's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business surveyed 150 small to midsize businesses in 19 cities spanning 13 product categories. Findings revealed 66 percent of the merchants said the Groupon promotions were profitable while 32 percent said they were not. More than 40 percent of the companies wouldn't run a Groupon offer again. Restaurants fared the worst among service businesses with Groupon deals, while spas and salons were the most successful.The real deal is that any business looking to use Groupon, or one of its competitors like LivingSocial, must have a much broader perspective. You don't want to devote a lot of your budget to these daily deal sites. Such a promotion has to be part of your overall marketing plan along with how you are using Facebook, Twitter, Google Adwords, and so on. You can make a deal as long as it's the right one for your line of business.The problem is that businesses often go into a promotion without a good understanding of what they want to accomplish. The Rice study found that the ability of employees to handle the surge of business from bargain shoppers, for example, was critical to the success of that company's particular promotion. The way it works is that Groupon offers different deals each day for a local good, service or event in a city where it operates. Discounts range from 50 percent to 90 percent off. The promotion is only valid if a certain number of consumers purchase the deal within 24 hours. Groupon keeps 50 percent of the revenues from each coupon deal."What happens is that the Groupon promotion runs and then there is a flood of customers coming to their store," says the study's author and Jones School associate marketing professor Utpal Dholakia. Business owners don't think through their costs and how they are going to make money on the promotion. "So, in turn they end up losing a lot of money. They don't recover it from customer behavior," he explains.Take for instance a massage therapist who complained that everyone who came in for his promotion got a massage and then walked out. Most of them didn't spend anything beyond getting the freebie. He lost money on the promotion itself and there was no way to recoup that lost. Dholakia suggests that instead of promoting a particular service such as a massage or a facial, the owner should have promoted a particular dollar amount.In other words, he might have offered $100 worth of services for $50. This increases the chance that the consumer will come in and buy more than just one item. Now a newbie might come in to get a massage but then decide to get a facial as well. "You have to take advantage of an opportunity to cross-sale other products and services. You have to prepare your staff to engage customers. You have to be careful how you structure the promotion," says Dholakia. Groupon has its pros and cons, so, you need to decide if this is something worth your business getting into. Here are five reasons in favor of and five reasons against group buying promotions. Dig Deeper: 4 Tips for Using Groupon CouponsPros 1.    It attracts a lot of consumers. You can reach new customers by appealing to those who are looking for inexpensive deals and a chance to save money. You get to charge lower prices to new customers who aren't willing to pay more. Existing customers are willing to pay full price for products or services. Dholakia says that Groupon promotions offer the most benefit for businesses in which the promotion does not cannibalize sales to existing customers. 2.    It advertises your business. A Groupon promotion can be a way to announce the existence of your business to consumers who are unfamiliar with your products or services. You get to entice potential customers to try your goods. The idea is that they are going to like it so much that they will come back and buy from you again. You must make your promotion grab consumers but at the same time increase your potential conversion rate for repeat customers, says Dholakia.3.    It helps move inventory. Use Groupon deals to sell slow moving items in your inventory or unutilized services. Discounts seem to be most compelling for merchants with low cost of goods sold. Use price deals to promote a product that is not that expensive. A Groupon type promotion should be something that you do once in a while for a specific, narrow, limited reason, adds Dholakia.4.    It builds relationships. Use price promotion deals for building customer relationships rather than just creating one-time buys, recommends Dholakia. Meaning, instead of a restaurant owner offering $60 worth of food for $30, parcel it out to offer $20 worth of food for $10 over the customer's next three visits. Don't offer discounts on a total bill, rather offer a specialized discount for various products or services. 5.    It generates incremental revenue. If you have a low-cost or fixed-cost structure, you can make money on promotions. Take an owner of a rock-climbing business that has existing equipment and a storefront. The operating costs don't change based on the number of people who show up. A coupon deal can actually generate some extra cash by getting more bodies into the facility. Customers paying $10 for a $20 service, still nets the owner $5 per voucher. Dholakia says each merchant must know their costs, factor in a price that draws customers, project the number of costumers that will buy the coupon, and estimate incremental revenues.Dig Deeper: How Groupon Works for Small Businesses
Cons1.    Deals attract low-end bargain seekers. Because the Groupon customer base is made up of deal-seekers and bargain shoppers they might not be willing to purchase beyond the value of the coupon. So, there are low rates of spending and low rates of return. One problem with price deals is diminishing returns; thus, merchants need to put a cap on the number of deal coupons that are to be sold, says Dholakia. 2.    Deals hurt the brand. The obsession with price doesn't necessarily make for a lot of brand loyalty or even brand awareness. One negative aspect of daily deal sites is that price promotions usually hurt the brand of the company offering it, says Dholakia. It makes customers price sensitive. When they get something at a much lower price, they then become less inclined to pay full price for that same product or service in the future. 3.    Deals don't generate repeat customers. Groupon has a low conversion rate for repeat customers, according to marketing experts. You may never see the person again once they use your coupon. Or that person may not be willing to buy from you again without a coupon in hand. The percent of new customers that redeem the voucher that becomes repeat visitors of the business is estimated at around 19 percent. It varies by product categories. 4.    Deals are not profitable. Another problem is the split. Groupon keeps 50 percent of the revenues from each coupon deal. If you do the math, merchants need to gross margins well in excess of 50 percent for Groupon to work for them. The promotion is very steep, usually 50 percent or more. Most businesses are built on margins of 75 percent, which means if the customer just comes in and buys the deal, the owner is going to loose money, says Dholakia. Restaurants usually have higher margins. "By offering huge discounts and giving 50 percent to Groupon, they just aren't earning enough to cover the cost of serving that customer." 5.    There are better deals out there. Daily deals sites are not the only game in town. You can run a similar promotion for less money. There are plenty of marketing programs you can use; does it make sense to use this one, asks Dholakia. For example, you can offer a discount or promotion on a Facebook fan page. It's an effective way to engage new and existing customers at a very low cost, he adds.

Groupon Goods for All Your Online Shopping
Groupon is all about helping you find new experiences, and that extends to online shopping. Our collection of consumer goods is always expanding with new items to enrich your ever-changing life, whether it’s athletic apparel to wear on that upcoming 5K or cell phone accessories to outfit your newest gadget. Welcome to Groupon Goods, your source for deals on everything from cookware to pet sweaters.
Make Home Life Easier
Keeping up a household is hard work, but Groupon carries all the items you need to maintain a full, happy home. That starts with transforming every space into an extension of yourself—a task to which our For the Home section is well suited, thanks to online deals on new bedding that suits your style or outdoor furniture to turn your patio into a second living room. To keep your family happy, Groceries & Pets stocks your pantry with items such as extra coffee pods—or bulk wine, which seems to run out just as fast—as well as toys for your loyal critters. Keeping up with the kids is a race you might never win, but at least you can stay apace as kids grow. (When they’re newborns, baby care essentials keep them safe; when they’re toddlers, toys keep parents sane.) Of course, maintaining a home or car sometimes requires a little maintenance, too, in which case keep chaos at bay with a range of home improvement supplies, including major appliances.
Stay on Trend
Online shopping isn’t just for keeping up with your busy life, though—it’s also to enrich your lifestyle. Groupon keeps up with the latest trends, adding new deals every day to a selection of clothing for both men and women. Women's Fashion comprises everything from handbags to bras, whereas Men's Fashion covers both casual and business apparel. Likewise, much of our jewelry sport unisex designs—though different shoppers may have very different motives for browsing diamond jewelry . Both men’s and women’s fragrances waft through the Health & Beauty section, along with an ever-changing variety of cosmetics, haircare, skincare, and personal hygiene products.
Play Hard
No online store is complete without a reason to have fun, so Groupon gives you plenty of ways to occupy your free time. Gadgets galore fill the Electronics section, where the virtual aisles overflow with cell phones and accessories, computers and tablets, and home theater equipment. But even the biggest HDTV is nothing without entertainment to play on it,such as movies, video games, and music—though if you’re more into books and magazines, you’ll find plenty of titles from which to choose. Not all leisure time is spent on the couch, though. Sporting goods keep you active in the Great Outdoors, outfitting you with new clubs for the golf course or plenty of provisions for a camping trip in the woods. And if it’s raining out, spend a couple happy hours adding to your collection of sports cards, commemorative coins, or other collectibles.

Groupon Goods for All Your Online Shopping
Groupon is all about helping you find new experiences, and that extends to online shopping. Our collection of consumer goods is always expanding with new items to enrich your ever-changing life, whether it’s athletic apparel to wear on that upcoming 5K or cell phone accessories to outfit your newest gadget. Welcome to Groupon Goods, your source for deals on everything from cookware to pet sweaters.
Make Home Life Easier
Keeping up a household is hard work, but Groupon carries all the items you need to maintain a full, happy home. That starts with transforming every space into an extension of yourself—a task to which our For the Home section is well suited, thanks to online deals on new bedding that suits your style or outdoor furniture to turn your patio into a second living room. To keep your family happy, Groceries & Pets stocks your pantry with items such as extra coffee pods—or bulk wine, which seems to run out just as fast—as well as toys for your loyal critters. Keeping up with the kids is a race you might never win, but at least you can stay apace as kids grow. (When they’re newborns, baby care essentials keep them safe; when they’re toddlers, toys keep parents sane.) Of course, maintaining a home or car sometimes requires a little maintenance, too, in which case keep chaos at bay with a range of home improvement supplies, including major appliances.
Stay on Trend
Online shopping isn’t just for keeping up with your busy life, though—it’s also to enrich your lifestyle. Groupon keeps up with the latest trends, adding new deals every day to a selection of clothing for both men and women. Women's Fashion comprises everything from handbags to bras, whereas Men's Fashion covers both casual and business apparel. Likewise, much of our jewelry sport unisex designs—though different shoppers may have very different motives for browsing diamond jewelry . Both men’s and women’s fragrances waft through the Health & Beauty section, along with an ever-changing variety of cosmetics, haircare, skincare, and personal hygiene products.
Play Hard
No online store is complete without a reason to have fun, so Groupon gives you plenty of ways to occupy your free time. Gadgets galore fill the Electronics section, where the virtual aisles overflow with cell phones and accessories, computers and tablets, and home theater equipment. But even the biggest HDTV is nothing without entertainment to play on it,such as movies, video games, and music—though if you’re more into books and magazines, you’ll find plenty of titles from which to choose. Not all leisure time is spent on the couch, though. Sporting goods keep you active in the Great Outdoors, outfitting you with new clubs for the golf course or plenty of provisions for a camping trip in the woods. And if it’s raining out, spend a couple happy hours adding to your collection of sports cards, commemorative coins, or other collectibles.
