				HIGH TECH BLADES WITH SUPERB FEEL AND EXTRA SPEED FOR THE 2008 CHANGE

Carbon materials will be widely used in blades beyond 2008 to compensate the speed. But the downside of the conventional carbon blade is the serious loss of feeling. The definite feeling for better control is the core competence for professional players. Wavestone MKII has focused on creating sensitive feel by introducing a new layer combination and special gluings.  Arylate-Carbon or soft carbon are carefully matched with selected woods to create the upgraded character,

Arylate/Carbon - Arylate-Carbon blade is made by the hybrid technology used by Vectran fiber and Carbon. Carbon offers high speed and excellent stability, Arylate a very good elasticity

The blade was originally designed in JAPAN. But after consultation with the engineers at Dawei, we asked for this new version to be made, It consists of a Solid Handle, giving this blade back the Balance it required, We also insisted they made the Handle Longer & Thicker to Facilitate the Larger European & Australian Hand.


This is a FAST (OFF+) attack style blade, but with a Vey soft feel, providing a perfect combination of speed and control.
This is a High-Tech 5-ply blade (2 arylate-carbon, 3 wood). It implements the new IB TECH technology, which improves speed, balance, control and provides better touch. The high grade carbon layers provide a huge sweetspot. The Arylate dampens the excess vibrations caused by impact, and provides a much softer feel to the blade. This blade offer huge power at all distances, and is outstanding for looping, power drives, smashes and blocking, but has soft enough feel for some touch shots.

						Very fast, very spinny, stiff blade with little dwell time. It is very bouncy. The feeling is soft but dwell time is very low. 

less spinny than the Galaxy T8, being harder. But it has more power than the Galaxy T8. 

I got one which weight 98 grams, and another one, more recent, which weighs 87 grams. So ask your dealer for the weight you like.

This blade is very good both with hard and soft rubbers. I have used it with great satisfaction with Hurricane 3 2.2, Gambler outlaw 2.2, Galaxy Sun 2.2.

the throw is rather low (but not as low as other carbon blades such as galaxy t4) and the trajectory is long.

too fast for tensor rubbers, at least at my level.

Who We Are
WaveStone Capital is an Australian equities investment manager based in Sydney. WaveStone’s founding principals, Graeme Burke and Catherine Allfrey, have worked together since 1998. The pair, together with recently retired principal and ongoing shareholder, Ian Harding, formed WaveStone Capital in 2006. Raaz Bhuyan joined WaveStone Capital as a principal in 2014, bringing with him over 20 years of project finance, broking and investment management experience.
Together, we have a passion for investing and hence a high conviction approach to buying stocks, but we also want to be able to vary the exposure to the market by holding cash and shorting stocks and the index. Our corporate logo is a Plasmid – a circular, independent strand of DNA capable of self-replication. It represents our strong, autonomous approach to investing and our potential to achieve competitive, repeatable performance.






Meet the Principals
WaveStone Capital's principal investment team have experienced events such as the tech bubble, September 11, 2001 and the Global Financial Crisis. They have managed multi-product and multi‑billion dollar funds in both wholesale and retail markets with distinction, throughout a range of market conditions and cycles.Fidante Partners, an equity owner in WaveStone, provides important administrative and distribution support, leaving us free to concentrate on what really matters – investing and managing assets.

Customer Reviews

Thank you very much to Wavestone for offering a thorough demonstration of how to utilise the benefits of the product. We had been using the tool in the club for a few months, however having Adrian demonstrate in person provided a far better overview of how to maximise the benefits of the product including its hot/cold properties. We will certainly be integrating the use of the Wavestone more into our practice at the club and the feedback from players to date is positive.

Since completing the Wavestone Clinical course I have introduced this massage tool into my treatments as it is not only an excellent way to warm up the targeted muscle (or muscle group) but can be used for effleurage, trigger point work, muscle stripping and many other techniques.   All of this as well as helping prolong the working life of the therapist. What's not to like?

Absolutely brilliant tool. I wish I'd had this years ago.

I bought the wavestone at the SMA conference last week, where Adrian did a really nice demo on the product, I told him I use the jack knobber and index knobber and always wondered why there wasn’t a product with a larger surface area? I was also amazed on how quickly it heats up in just hot tap water! This had a lot of boxes ticked for me!I have used it on two clients now who both really enjoyed it, especially around the scapular and lower back region, I plan on introducing this to a few more clients over the coming weeks.

Background
With the continually fluctuating financial environment, their revenues under intense pressure, and consumer behaviors profoundly changed, banks must up their tempo. Their accounting and controlling departments must transform themselves into nimble business partners, or risk becoming obsolete. Their answer: to turn into the one-stop-shop that can detect underlying customer trends, benchmark performance, and power product innovation.
Challenges
Working alongside the client, Wavestone is tackling three major challenges:

Integration: data has to be readily available, centralized and harmonized. Tools must be shared across business lines, allowing streamlined analysis and on-demand reporting.
Responsiveness: move away from an after-the-facts approach to a proactive and predictive attitude.
People: train the workforce to use analytical methods and modern digital tools.

Responses and Key Success Factors
Using a holistic approach, Wavestone is involved throughout the transformation process of the accounting and controlling departments, from defining novel services, implementing new tools, to improving the way employees work:

Swift: rapid-iteration method involving key users.
Inclusive: co-construction approach with all stakeholders (accountants, controllers, IT, and commercial departments).
Supportive: continuous support and thorough training of staff.

In search for optimal price : the importance of demand-based approach



                                        22 November 2016                                    

Traditionally, selling prices are set by companies according cost-based or competition-based approaches. Yet, the demand-based approach (or “determining the optimal price”) is often the most relevant.
