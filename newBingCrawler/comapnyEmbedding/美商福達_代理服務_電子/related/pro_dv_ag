"A Day of Life" Highlight Scenes


Scene 1: This 4K Camera Recorder is ideal for documentaries. It combines stunning 4K picture quality, excellent mobility with its integrated lens, rich gradation with its V-Log L, and a long recording time with no file restrictions.


Scene 2: This clearly evokes images of wedding videography. It was recorded entirely with the V-Log L, which can be seen in the expression produced by the wide dynamic range.



Scene 3: This clear picture quality has excellent details and minimal color bleeding, thanks to its 4K (4096 x 2160) resolution and LEICA DICOMAR 4K lens.



Scene 4: There's almost no compression noise even in difficult scenes, such as this one with the spray of the waterfall and the light filtering through the trees.



Scene 5: This beautiful bokeh effect was achieved useing a shallow depth of field. The large 4/3-type sensor and Macro function provide the same level of expression as you get with a DSLR camera.



Scene 6: This running bike shot, taken from a helicopter, was totally handheld. Sports scenes like this are possible thanks to the wide zoom range, powerful focusing, and excellent hand-shake correction.



Scene 7: This fast-action shot was recorded at UHD/60p and HD/120p (VFR 120fps) for beautifully dynamic images with a slow-motion effect.



Scene 8: Remarkable level of expression made possible by the wide angle of view and high-definition 4K imaging. The creator's sensibility is clearly expressed in the image, thanks to the camera's agile mobility.

Product description
The Panasonic AG-DV2500 records, edits, and plays both mini-DV and standard DV cassettes (up to 4.6 hours) while also offering DVCAM playback, making it a versatile solution for virtually any modern digital editing studio. Equipped with an IEEE 1394-compliant four-pin DV terminal, the AG-DV2500 offers a host of functions, including synchronized recording with a DV camera/recorder, uploading to a PC in a nonlinear editing system, and downloading files after editing. You will also like the DVCAM compatibility, which makes it easy to integrate DVCAM source material within a project without buying or renting expensive equipment. And as with any good editing unit, the AG-DV2500 is also versatile from an audio perspective, with two-channel (16-bit, 48 kHz sampling) and four-channel (12-bit, 32 kHz sampling) modes. In the latter, you can use open channels later to dub in narration or other audio. Other details include PAL and NTSC playback and recording, which makes it a breeze to work with international material and upload it to a nonlinear editing system; 500-plus lines of horizontal resolution for a superb picture; front panel audio level indicators; a synchro lock function that links to the Panasonic AG-DVX100 camcorder for backup or dub recording; a time/date generator; and a nine-pin RS-422A control terminal.

This adds up to stable images with minimal hand shaking, plus the kind of quick, easy subject framing you simply cannot get with a handheld camera.  The AG-DV7's shoulder-held design gives you steady images and quick framing of subjects  15x Zoom Lens and Digital Zoom The AG-DVC7 comes with a powerful 15x zoom lens and adds a digital zoom function that provides ultra-telephoto zooming all the way to 750x. Its large zoom rocker switch is conveniently positioned on the handle grip for easy, responsive zoom operation. The extra zoom power is a great plus for sports applications or whenever the shooter can't get close to the action.  Manual/Auto Focus and More Switch between auto and manual focus according to your shooting needs. In manual mode, the large focus ring provides you the kind of focusing precision you'd expect from a professional camera. You can manually adjust the iris, shutter speed, white balance and audio recording level when desired.  Auto Functions for Beautiful Results with Ease The AG-DVC7's many automatic functions make it easy to produce beautiful videos. These include Digital EIS (Electric Image Stabilizer) to compensate for jitter and vibration-induced image distortions, Backlight Compensation to prevent black breakdown, and Auto Tracking White Balance for superb pictures when tracking moving subjects.   Conveniently placed controls on the AG-DV7 Program AE The AG-DVC7 comes preset with ideal iris size and shutter speed combinations for a variety of subjects and shooting conditions. Select from five program AE modes: sports, portrait, spotlight, surf & snow, and low light. These settings allow you to take perfect shots quickly and easily.  Superior Digital Recording The AG-DVC7 uses the ubiquitous DV format, with an 8-bit digital recording system that delivers high-quality pictures. The 16-bit digital audio system rivals CDs in quality. Choose sound in either a 48-kHz/16-bit, 2-channel, or a 32-kHz/12-bit, 4-channel mode during playback.  IEEE1394 DV In/Out Terminal A DV (IEEE1394) 4-pin digital interface terminal makes it easy to upload pictures and audio to a Macintosh or Windows-based PC for non-linear editing with no loss of quality. Users can also dub with no deterioration between the AG-DVC7 and an AG-DV1DC, AG-DV2500 or other DV VTR.  Options for the Professional An accessory kit and a variety of additional options are available with the AG-DVC7. Add a 0.7x wide conversion lens, external stereo microphone, or large-capacity 2.8-A battery depending on your professional needs.  Other Features  2.5-inch color LCD side monitor Rec start/stop button and zoom lever on top handle grip Picture Effects Function includes Wipe, Mix, Strobe, Gainup, Trail, Mosaic, and Mirror Jog Menu Dial Video and S-Video In/Out Mic In and Audio In/Out   The MiniDV Format MiniDV, the most common type of digital camcorder, records video using the standard DV-format. It's the preferred format for broadcast-quality video, and it is also highly regarded for its high audio and still image quality. This is all delivered on a cassette that's 1/12th the size of a standard VHS tape. Tapes come in lengths of 60 and 80 minutes at standard speed (SP), with use of lower speed mode (SP) increasing time to 90 and 120 minutes while reducing resolution.  Playing DV Tapes on a DVCPRO VTR Using the AJ-CS455P adaptor, mini-DV cassettes can be played back by a DVCPRO VTR. This means you can utilize mini-DV cassettes as media (playback only) in DVCPRO production systems. Panasonic's Emmy Award-winning DVCPRO format is the industry's standard for digital acquisition and recording, and the most rapidly adopted professional video format in history. Recording is not possible, even with the adaptor. Also, DVCPRO systems cannot play back DV tapes recorded in LP mode, or long-play Mini-DV tapes (SP mode: 80 minutes; LP mode: 120 minutes).  Possible configurations with additional components  What's in the Box: Panasonic AG-DVC7, shoulder strap, AC cable, lens cap, DC cable, battery 1.6-Ah, AC adapter, wireless remote controller, battery for wireless remote controller, cleaning tape.

Made a initial test video, ok!  All is all for the price a good deal but without the remote, staging self videos is not a easy task.In this case seller not completely trustful, the original missing parts described  on the package list should have been there, or the seller"s description should have indicated it.Will have to spend additional funds to make the camcorder complete.  I was not aware in advance that there would shortfalls in the package, Not good seller !!!!!.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsHavre used the camera for 3 years...not bad..good picture quality, looks professional to your clientsByJ. Osunaon October 30, 2009Have used the camcorder for over 3 years, our retired community video club owns two of them. Has great picture quality in good lighting, rivals my 3CCD Cannon GL-2. The Panasonic does a decent job on lower lighting situations. I frequently use it to partner up with my Cannon GL-2 for the second camera shots. Only had one of the 2 Pansonics needed repairs to the tape motor mechanism, the other same model Panasonic in our inventory, has not needed repairs, in those same three years of very frequent club use.  Our clients are impressed when we show up with the large Panasonic. It is easy to operate. I would buy another one. It seems to take small abuses well, it is used by serveral different club members, so you know that it has had bumps and small drops.  The handle is very handy to carry the camcorder around and to take low shots as we walk around, you could not do that with non-handle type camcorders. On the bad side of this review, I noticed that in lower light situations with long shots, if the subject walked to the edge of your shooting view screen, the camcorder would go out of focus, then to compensate I would have to move the subject back into the center of the shot. So, in the low light situations, the camera is fooled and goes out of focus on the subject and focuses on the background.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsI didn't get what I paid forByDustin Alexander-Pérezon October 9, 2013Verified PurchaseI don't like writing bad reviews, but while this camera, if it were brand new, would be one of my first choices, the camera I received did not live up to its description. It had obviously been very used and there were significant parts missing; primarily the software to make the cam work with our computers was not available. I didn't mind the cosmetic damage as that's obvious with a used item, but this camera was not new as advertised. However, I was refunded in full and have nothing personal against the sellers as they were polite about the entire matter.Read more0Comment|
