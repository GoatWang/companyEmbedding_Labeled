History[edit]
In 1969, Horst Eckard founded the company Eckard Design in Groß-Zimmern near Darmstadt. In the same year as the company was founded, the first branch office was opened in Cologne. A year later, the head office was moved to Fulda, and the company developed motor vehicles and production plants. Prototypes have also been constructed since 1986. The company's international activities began in 1987, with the opening of a branch office in Martorell (Barcelona) in Spain. The company's Rechtsform was changed in 1992, when it became a Aktiengesellschaft and the name Edag Engineering + Design AG came into being. In 1998, EDAG was the first automotive service provider to be admitted to the Verband der Automobilindustrie (Association of the German Automotive Industry). In 2004, FFT Flexible Fertigungstechnik GmbH & Co. KG, which is today called FFT Produktionssysteme GmbH & Co. KG, was integrated into the company. In February 2006, Lutz Helmig, owner of Aton GmbH and founder of the Helios-Kliniken, purchased EDAG from the nine founding families. In 2007, personnel service provider ED Work GmbH & Co. KG was founded.
As a result of the takeover by Aton GmbH, the legal form of the company changed on 11 January 2008 from a joint-stock company to a Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien.[1] A further consequence of the re-structuring was that directors Klaus Blickle and Jürgen Böhm left the company on 8 April 2008, and were replaced by long-standing managers Jörg Ohlsen, Manfred Hahl and Rainer Bauer.[2]
In the course of the merger with Rücker GmbH early in 2014, the executive board was re-structured. The Executive Board is composed of Jörg Ohlsen (CEO), Harald Poeschke (COO) and Jürgen Vogt (CFO). The head office was transferred to Wiesbaden. Since March 2015, EDAG has been operating under the name EDAG Engineering GmbH.
With the listing of EDAG Engineering Group AG on the German stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main (Prime Standard), ISIN 0303692047, EDAG Engineering GmbH became part of EDAG Engineering Group AG. As in the past, the company's operative business continues to be carried out at the corporate group's branch offices. Founded in November 2015, EDAG Engineering Group AG is based in Arbon, Switzerland, and, as a Swiss joint-stock company, is managed by a Board of Directors, the president of which is Thomas Eichelmann. Mr. Ohlsen (CEO) and Mr. Vogt (CFO), both directors of EDAG Engineering GmbH, are also directors of EDAG Engineering Group AG.
Offices[edit]
The branch offices on five continents are mostly located at important sites of partner industries.

Automotive industry[edit]
EDAG is noted for its concept cars such as EDAG Biwak estate concept on the Beetle, the EDAG Pontiac Solstice Hardtop and the EDAG Show Car No. 8 based on Smart mechanicals. EDAG has conducted design work for the application of 3D-printing (additive manufacturing) technology under their "Genesis project", in which Fraunhofer, Laser Zentrum Nord and DMRC Paderborn participated.[3]

Making ideas move - that's what ELAN-AUSY stands for! As a development partner for structure, cabins, systems, system integration, software and electronics, we provide our customers comprehensive engineering services from a single source. In a supporting role, our "consulting" arm offers product and project management expertise in the form of advisory services. If the flexibility of temporary personnel is required, our "on-site support" staff will deliver the same level of expertise as would be expected under a work and service contract.
Holistic development services and responsible project management enable ELAN-AUSY to fulfil the stringent requirements of our customers from initial concept through to implementation, verification and documentation, thereby creating the prerequisites for the production of complex parts and systems. Therefore, we are able to offer a complete engineering service portfolio in development and research projects. 
In association with its parent company AUSY, ELAN-AUSY has the commercial power and international alignment of a globally-oriented company. Transnational projects and implementation of work packages in off-shore or low-cost countries are called for by our customers not only for reasons of cost, but also increasingly on strategic grounds. ELAN-AUSY has the experience and capability to implement these orders through group branches on practically a worldwide basis.
ELAN-AUSY also assumes entrepreneurial responsibility as a value-adding partner and works in cooperation with its customers to shape the future. All development tasks are naturally safeguarded by a certified quality management system.
ELAN-AUSY cooperates closely with universities and offers young talents not only the supervision of Bachelor and Master theses, but also the possibility to become a part of the company as a working student. This allows us to strengthen our team with junior staff continuously.

Mechanical Engineering & Industrial Processes 





ActivitiesAUSY is a major player in mechanical engineering, specifically in the field of aeronautics, and is able to offer a comprehensive facility as well as a network of design offices in France, Germany, India and the United States. AUSY is involved in all mechanical processes from mechanical design (CAE) to structural analysis and stress analysis to dimensioning, as well as R&D of materials (metals/composites) and product design. AUSY is a recognised leader in the design of aircraft cabins and F&DT (Fatigue and Damage Tolerance) studies. The Group also possesses a high level of expertise in mechanical specialties such as F&DT or Jigs & Tools design (used to equip an industrial manufacturing line). In July 2013, AUSY set up a new mechanical design office in the United States to accompany Airbus in the development of A320 NEO final assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama. 
Capacity of interventionAUSY is involved in both local projects and large-scale projects that require a transnational organisation.


Structure and dimensioningOur involvement in computation covers all development stages, from pre-dimensioning to justification, from the drafting of certification documents to series support.
Our engineers analyse the resistance of structures for static loading and perform fatigue and damage tolerance studies. 
Our core competence areas allow us to be involved in all simulation issues such as vibration analysis, non-linear computations, thermomechanical computations and fast dynamics. 
 
 



F&DTAUSY draws on its strong expertise in fatigue to justify the lifetime and the damage tolerance of an aeroplane and its components, and to analyse the crack propagation and the residual strength. AUSY also carefully monitors test cells to compile results and to correlate them with computations. AUSY masters the methodologies and tools of each aircraft manufacturer and lends its expertise to other industries.
At our F&TD training centre in TEAC (Toulouse Elan-AUSY Centre), our engineers receive training on this specific profession, on both theoretical foundations and tools employed by our clients. 
 
 



Cabin designAUSY is a European leader in the design of secondary structures (aircraft fairing, electronic equipment) specifically in metals and composites for cabin interior design, conversion or the modification of an aircraft cabin:
• Design and 3D modelling, including the development of specifications and manufacturing documents
• Definition of supports for the installation of this equipment 
 
 



R&D of composite materialsOur teams’ consolidated experience in materials engineering and computation allows them to analyse and optimise the specific behaviours of composites while capitalising on their positive features: lightweight, strong mechanical and chemical resistance, low maintenance, shape. Our involvement is particularly focused on GLARE (GLAss-REinforced) and CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic).
