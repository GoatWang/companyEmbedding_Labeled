Quality and Services








Management ApproachMateriality Rationale


In recent years, customers and other stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about the protection of consumer rights. Product safety, security, and accessibility are very important in this respect. Sony is expected to provide products and customer services that are high in quality from the customer's point of view.






Basic Approach


True to its Philosophy and Policy for Product Quality and Customer Services, Sony is wholeheartedly committed to improving product and service quality from the customer's point of view in order to both maintain and enhance satisfaction, confidence, and trust. In particular, Sony is working to ensure product quality and improve accessibility and usability, in the conviction that its most important goal is to remain a highly trusted partner to all customers.






Structure


Sony has configured its global quality management system by defining quality management mechanisms across all processes, from product development, planning, design, and manufacturing through sales and customer service. This has included defining the roles, responsibilities, and authority of those responsible for product and customer service quality and establishing guidelines.






Main Achievements in Fiscal 2015


Here are the main results of fiscal 2015 initiatives:


In order to deliver customers product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations, Sony adopted a wide range of in-house rules, and abided by them scrupulously.
In order to improve long-term reliability, Sony's Quality Reliability Lab developed new reliability and evaluation technologies that are well suited to elemental technologies, new technologies, and products.
Information gleaned from Customer Information Centers throughout the world was collected in a single location and used to improve products and support.
Sony analyzed customer feedback (including comments made on social networking sites) in an effort to improve quality and products.
In order to provide customers with truly useful support and information, staff who deal directly with customers regularly attended training and education activities to familiarize themselves with new technologies and shared information on how to solve problems.
Sony established a coordinated usability testing structure and environment that includes Sony sites in Japan and around the world.
Sony conducted surveys and user interviews to assess long-term use of products and services.
Sony presented information visually in its startup guides to make the information easier to understand.
Sony revised the Sony Group Website Accessibility Policy.
Enhancing accessibility and usability features on LCD TV BRAVIA™, PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®Vita.














Looking to the Future


Sony will continue to take the customer's point of view in order to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed customers' expectations. This is a necessary first step toward ensuring product quality and security, and preventing safety problems before they cause any harm. With these aims in mind, Sony will continue making use of its worldwide network to collect and analyze information which can then be reflected in the next releases of products and services.

 How you can get certified with a simple and practical ISO 9001 kit that won't break the bank    more





What is a Quality System?  
It's the system that an organisation uses to manage the quality of their services or products.  Quality management systems are only one type of management system; other examples include financial management systems, safety management systems and environmental management systems.
 
The official definition of a quality system from ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is 'the management system used to direct and control an organization with regard to quality'.  But that's a bit of a mouthful, and not overly clear (as with many of their definitions).
 
Think of it as the system that your company uses to plan, create, develop, make and/or deliver your services or products. 

 
For a service business, it's the system you use to provide those services.  If you sell or distribute products that other people build/make/create, then it's the system you use to get, store, sell and deliver or install them. And if you make or manufacture "widgets", it's whatever system you use to make them or have them made for you. 

 

A quality management system consists of various  elements. 

ISO 9001 groups them into these into 4 categories: 


Management - planning, goals & objectives, reviewing progress) 


Resources - people, tools, equipment etc

Services or Products 'realisation' - whatever is involved in creating or delivering them, and lastly the 


Monitor, Measurement & Checking - the all-important feedback loop. 

So you see that the scope of a quality management system extends beyond just what you do to make the service or product itself.  It includes how you:

manage your organisation: planning, setting goals, reviewing progress and results 
make sure people are competent for their work and the right resources are available: plant, equipment, IT, tools, etc 
check and analyse results, to see what happened and why 
identify failures or problems systematically and fix them 

improve. 

All these elements work together in the system with two main overall aims:

producing services or goods of consistent quality which meet all applicable requirements
increasing customer satisfaction. 


You probably already have a quality system
Do you run a business now? Have you been doing it for a year or more? Still in business and/or growing?  




If you answer yes to these questions, then you do already have a quality system. It won't be an 'ISO 9001 quality system' yet, but you have some kind of quality management system in place. And probably already have some kind of QC in place, perhaps also some QA. But to reach ISO 9001 level, you'll need to meet all the mandatory requirements.

The requirements of good manufacturing practice are underpinned by a central objective: to create a system of programs, policies, processes, and facilities that prevent errors and defects. Senior managers in the drug industry are responsible for the effectiveness of this system, which is known as the Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS). A PQS is successful when it assures an ongoing state of control. In a healthy PQS, managers establish a vigilant quality culture in which timely action is taken to prevent risks to quality. Lifecycle adaptations are made to address manufacturing weaknesses and continually improve systems. An effective process performance and product quality monitoring program provides early warning of emerging quality issues. Systemic solutions are implemented rather than ineffective shortcuts. A firm will also habitually attend to the seemingly small problems that quality experts remind us later would accumulate into costly, complex problems. An effective PQS will ultimately support stable processes, and predictable quality and supply.

Quality Systems InspectionsFDA's routine surveillance inspections determine whether a site’s Quality System is operating in a state of control. Inspections cover multiple systems (see below compliance program). All inspections audit the overall quality assurance system to determine if it is functioning well. This aspect includes evaluating if responsible managers are notified of, and respond to, emerging quality problems, process control issues, or any new stresses on the system that may lead to defective medicines.

GuidancesThe US, EU, and Japan have adopted ICH Q10 “Pharmaceutical Quality Systems,” a guidance that creates a harmonized system based in GMPs and ISO.  The PQS "assures that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.”  FDA also issued guidance in 2006 that provides further information on quality systems.

Joint FDA/EMA/PDMA/PDA/ISPE Training on ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality Systems ICH Q10 Training has been conducted in 2011 and 2012 in US, Europe, and Japan.  The training provides an introduction to ICH Q10 principles, terminology, and implementation approaches.  Regulators from all three regions participated and discussed quality systems expectations.   Industry from the three regions also participated, and provided practical case studies.  Future training is also planned outside the ICH regions.  See this link for agendas and presentations.

PDA ICH Q10 Workshop: Responsibilities of Executive Management (Operations and Quality) Sept 2012With a common goal to advance pharmaceutical quality systems (PQS), FDA and the industry are holding workshops exploring how to build an effective PQS to ensure an ongoing state of control. The first ICH Q10 workshop focused on the role of Executive Management to establish the right environment to enable daily quality assurance. Companies shared how a PQS that executes good science and effectively manages risk throughout the lifecycle will achieve sustainable compliance and consistent quality.

I had an individual, supposedly trained by PermaCrete, apply their product to the exterior of my house. The job was done so poorly even the building inspector commented on it. This qualified installer then left the state.I called PermaCrete to see what help they could provide as far as what my options are to get this fixed. They would not even return my call.Their attitude, we are not responsible for what our trained installers do. You would think that they would make an effort to ensure that installers, when released on to the public, would know what they are doing.  There are so many good products on the market with people who know what they are doing.There is absolutely no reason to use the PermaCrete product or any of their qualified installers.

The Sony Pledge of Quality declares our commitment: "Sony employees will always respect our customers' viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations." To this end, Sony promotes continuous, decisive efforts to enhance product quality and to reinforce its quality management system.






Sony's Quality Management System Framework








Sony has configured its quality management system by defining quality management mechanisms across all processes, from product planning, development, design and manufacturing through sales and customer service. This has included defining the roles, responsibilities and authority of those responsible for product and customer service quality and establishing guidelines.



Framework of Sony's Quality Management System







Based on this quality management system, Sony is implementing measures on an ongoing basis to improve the quality of its products and services. Examples of such measures are given below. Sony: 

Has appointed the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and has tasked this person with coordinating efforts to improve product and customer service quality and ensure timely responses to problems;
Has appointed Quality Officers within each business unit and has tasked them with promoting activities to improve product quality and spearheading initiatives to enhance the quality of products and services in specific business areas under the direction and supervision of the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and the head of the relevant business unit;
Has appointed CS Officers to coordinate customer service departments in markets around the world where Sony products are sold and has tasked them with spearheading a network of global-level initiatives under the supervision of the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and the individual in charge of the relevant regional headquarters;
Has created a framework for promoting business unit- and region-specific initiatives to ensure Sony's products comply with pertinent laws and regulations;
Has obtained certification under ISO 9001 for all sites manufacturing electronics products;
Has formulated mid-term and fiscal year targets for the quality of and customer service related to Sony products, as well as key quality-related indicators for business plans, with the aim of fulfilling the Sony Pledge of Quality. Business units and regional headquarters subsequently devised their own fiscal year quality and customer service targets and business plans, in line with which they continue to promote quality improvement initiatives;
Has held meetings of top managers responsible for quality and customer service in the electronics business to deliberate and decide on policy, targets, and key strategies related to product quality and customer service;
Has held regular meetings of Quality Officers from business units to evaluate the progress of quality-oriented business plans, promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and debate specific activities and responses to quality-related issues and common challenges;
Has held meetings of business unit Quality Officers and regional CS Officers to evaluate the progress of quality and customer service business plans and promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and to share information on customer service and product quality activities and common challenges, thereby contributing to global efforts to improve product quality and customer service;
Has formulated and administers Sony quality standards applicable to Sony's electronics products and related customer services, which focus on such criteria as product safety and performance, labeling and customer services. These standards are updated continuously to reflect technological advances, changes in applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and social changes, aiming to ensure Sony's ability to deliver quality and services that exceed the expectations of customers;
Has strengthened rules worldwide since 2006 to ensure prompt reporting to the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality, when Sony receives information about an incident involving a Sony product that affects customer safety or has the potential to do so. Based on the reports received, the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality provides the necessary follow-up and instructs the relevant divisions to investigate the incidents and respond appropriately to the customer. Since 2007, under the similar system, Sony has been addressing software security issues found in products and managing potential software security issues.







Responding to the Customer








Sony makes active use of customer feedback to improve its products and customer services. Opinions, reports of malfunctions after purchase, questions regarding use and other feedback received through Customer Information Centers are evaluated promptly and accurately and disseminated to the planning and design groups so that improvements in product quality can be made in a timely fashion, thus contributing to efforts to enhance product power.

In order to reinforce these efforts, Sony has since 2015 centralized all customer feedback received at Customer Information Centers and technical support desks around the world. This change allows for feedback to be used group-wide to improve Sony products and provide better information to customers. Sony has also begun analyzing customer feedback on social networking services (SNS), as well. 











Quality Hotline








It is vital to detect product quality-related problems as early as possible. To that end, Sony established the Quality Hotline in 2003 to gather product quality-related information, including reports of problems, as well as opinions from Sony Group employees. Employees can use the Quality Hotline, an in-house website, to send messages regarding such matters as product quality issues that are too difficult to handle at their workplace, and problems with the quality of product-related customer services as perceived by customers who have made use of those services. Upon investigating a problem to ascertain the veracity of the information received, the Quality Hotline office proposes and introduces measures to prevent previous problems from recurring and precluding potential new problems.

These initiatives are closely linked to the Sony Pledge of Quality, which states that "Sony employees will always respect our customers' viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations." Since the establishment of the Quality Hotline, Sony has received a diverse range of information, including proposals to make products more user-friendly and manuals easier to understand, which has led to a great many improvements.

As these initiatives indicate, employees across the Sony Group are wholeheartedly committed to working together to improve product and service quality from the customer's perspective with the aim of maintaining and enhancing customers' satisfaction, confidence and trust.






Market Quality Improvements








Sony has established dedicated quality management organizations in each of its business areas that are responsible for improving quality for pertinent products in each market.

At Sony headquarters, information related to quality issues arising in the marketplace is gathered in a timely manner from a broad range of sources in Japan and overseas and reported weekly to headquarters quality management and technical specialists. Based on the reported information, Sony ascertains whether or not issues in the marketplace have been addressed appropriately. In addition to ensuring that such issues are thoroughly addressed, Sony is accelerating its quality improvement performance by promoting measures to prevent recurrence and proactive measures in relation to quality issues.






Responses to Quality Issues








Sony recognizes that ensuring its customers' satisfaction, confidence and trust is one of its most important management tasks and strives to prevent quality-related problems through the systems and efforts described above.

Sony responds swiftly in the event of a quality-related issue, with the relevant departments working together to investigate facts and take appropriate action on a global scale. When such an issue arises, Sony decides and implements public announcements and market action for customers, after undertaking various inspections regarding the issue, following a process common to all Sony products. This process starts with the gathering of information from Customer Service Centers worldwide and collaboration with concerned local parties to ensure an accurate grasp of the issue. Based on information collected, Sony then works to determine the correct response by identifying the cause of the issue, implementing countermeasures and promptly verifying the effectiveness thereof, and reviewing the issue from the customer's perspective. Sony also cooperates with CS Officers at sites in each region to ensure the same level of service is provided to customers the world over. 

With regard to methods and media for issuing public announcements of product quality-related issues, Sony examines the effectiveness of the various means at its disposal, including the Internet, e-mail or other electronic media, as well as direct mail, newspaper advertisements or other conventional media.
