Our statisticians, survey methodologists, project managers, survey analysts, subject matter experts (SME), and consultants work side-by-side to collect the best possible data and maximize each client's ability to act on survey results. The statistical and methodological experience of the survey research staff is complemented by the depth and breadth of the subject matter expertise within ICF: health, housing, education, child welfare, family services, justice, energy, environment, criminal justice, social policy, transportation, finance, and technology.ICF survey research teams offer expertise across all data collection modes, including telephone, mail, web, in-person, and mixed-mode designs. We have a newly built, centralized operations center with 500 CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) stations, along with additional satellite centers and distributed interviewers. Our data collection personnel are trained to work with difficult-to-reach populations and sensitive topics. As a baseline, ICF offers very stringent data and system security, and we can make further accommodations up to the highest federal security standards (NIST High).
