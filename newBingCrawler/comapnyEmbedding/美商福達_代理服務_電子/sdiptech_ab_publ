 Press releaseJune 8, 2017, 19:00 Sdiptech completes acquisition of two companies in the elevator sector in Austria Sdiptech today completed the acquisition of 51 percent of the two Austrian companies ST Liftsystems GmbH and Aufzüge Friedl GmbH, both operating in the elevator sector. The acquisition agreement was originally signed on March 9, 2017. Sdiptech has an option to acquire the remaining 49 percent of both companies. ST Liftsystems manufactures elevators with a compact design that enables them to be installed in tight spaces in existing real estate as well as in new construction. The business model is designed to cost-efficiently size and package easily mounted elevators to installation companies globally. Aufzüge Friedl performs installation and servicing of elevators in Vienna and nearby areas. Jakob Holm, CEO of Sdiptech AB, comments: "With the acquisition of ST Liftsystems we get access to a very interesting product for our existing elevator operations in the Stockholm area, in addition to the fact that we obviously see great potential for international sales to independent operators. With Aufzüge Friedl we expand our elevator service business to Vienna, which, like Stockholm, is a fast-growing capital in line with our long-term strategy." Jürgen Friedl, founder of Aufzüge Friedl and ST Liftsystems, comments: "I am very pleased to get Sdiptech as a partner and I see great potential for ST Liftsystems, which has a product ready for serial production, to grow through Sdiptech's operations both in Sweden and internationally." Including the acquisition, Sdiptech's total revenue on an annual basis amounts to approximately SEK 1,015 million and EBITA to approximately SEK 157 million. For companies that have been part of the Group for less than one year, the latest annual accounts have been added to the Group's latest annual accounts. The total consideration for 51 percent of the two companies amounts to EUR 6.5 million. Future earnings in the two companies are distributed according to a model for additional consideration that stretches over five years. The option for the seller's remaining 49 percent stretches over ten years. In total, Sdiptech estimates that the present value of all future payments is approximately SEK 40 million, which will be reported as a liability in the Group's accounts. Sdiptech AB's common share of series B is traded under the name SDIP B with ISIN-code SE0003756758.  Sdiptech AB's preference share is traded under the name SDIP PREF with ISIN-code SE0006758348.

      PRESS RELEASE
      Stockholm, 1 June 2017
    

Notice of stabilization measures


Carnegie Investment Bank AB ("Carnegie")
      notifies that stabilization measures have been undertaken in
      Sdiptech AB's (publ) ("Sdiptech" or the "Company") class B
      shares traded on Nasdaq First North Premier


      As announced in connection with the offering to acquire newly
      issued class B shares in the Company and the listing of the
      Company's shares on Nasdaq First North Premier (the
      "Offering"), Carnegie may, acting as
      stabilization manager, carry out transactions aimed at
      supporting the market price of the shares at levels above
      those which might otherwise prevail in the open market.
    

      Stabilization transactions may be undertaken on Nasdaq First
      North Premier, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise,
      at any time during the period starting on the date of
      commencement of trading in the class B shares on Nasdaq First
      North Premier and ending no later than 30 calendar days
      thereafter. Carnegie is, however, not required to undertake
      any stabilization and there is no assurance that
      stabilization will be undertaken. Stabilization, if
      undertaken, may be discontinued at any time without prior
      notice. In no event will transactions be effected at levels
      above the price in the Offering.
    

      The Company's main shareholder, Serendipity Group AB has also
      granted Carnegie an option, which may be utilized in whole or
      in part for 30 days from the first date of trading in the
      Company's class B shares on Nasdaq First North Premier, to
      acquire up to 1,339,285 additional existing shares,
      corresponding to up to 15 percent of the total number of
      class B shares encompassed by the Offering, at a price
      corresponding to the price in the Offering, i.e. 56 SEK, to
      cover any overallotment in connection with the Offering.
    

      Carnegie has, in its capacity as stabilization manager,
      notified that stabilization measures have been undertaken, in
      accordance with article 5(4) in the Market Abuse Regulation
      596/2014, on Nasdaq First North Premier as specified below.
      The contact person at Carnegie is Johan Flintull (tel:

Aufzüge Friedl performs installation and servicing of elevators in Vienna and nearby areas. Jakob Holm, CEO of Sdiptech AB, comments: "With the acquisition of ST Liftsystems we get access to a very interesting product for our existing elevator operations in the Stockholm area, in addition to the fact that we obviously see great potential for international sales to independent operators.

For companies that have been part of the Group for less than one year, the latest annual accounts have been added to the Group's latest annual accounts. The total consideration for 51 percent of the two companies amounts to EUR 6.5 million. Future earnings in the two companies are distributed according to a model for additional consideration that stretches over five years. The option for the seller's remaining 49 percent stretches over ten years. In total, Sdiptech estimates that the present value of all future payments is approximately SEK 40 million, which will be reported as a liability in the Group's accounts.
