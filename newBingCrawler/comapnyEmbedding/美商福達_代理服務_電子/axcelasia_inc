Enterprise Management System (EMS) Applications






Our subsidiary, Axcelasia Softnex Sdn Bhd, develops and maintains the EMS Applications software for our clients. This software provides our clients with a user interface to input certain operational information, thereby creating a dashboard view of our client's governance, risk and compliance issues. Our EMS Applications software include the following modules:
ERM Module
In utilising this module, our clients are able to track their risk exposure in relation to the various stages of product development, project management and daily operations. It allows our clients to build and track their action plans, and highlight key business process risks to them.
 

 
Compliance Management Module
Our clients, especially those in highly regulated industries, often have to comply with numerous regulatory requirements. This module allows our clients to track compliance filings through user-friendly checklists, and raises follow-up reminders in relation to our client's action plans.
Whistle-Blowing Module
This module enables our client to automate the documentation and support of whistle-blowing cases.
Internal Audit Module
This module enables our clients to fully automate their internal audit processes including managing work papers, generating internal audit reports, recording the time incurred in completing each internal audit engagement, staff scheduling and monitoring the status of internal audit findings.
Incident and Insurance Management Module
Employees can enter details of workplace health and safety incidents into our EMS Application software, which keeps a database of details such as the cause, location and time of the incident, and the impact of the incident on the organisation. Upon being notified of the incident, our client can immediately validate the incident and submit details to the insurance agent through our EMS Application software for processing of insurance claims.
ISMS
This module provides our clients a systematic approach for the identification, assessment and management of information security risks. This will help clients to minimise the impact that various security related threats and vulnerabilities might have on an organisation.

2017 Chief Risk Officers Roundtable Discussion



2017 seems to be a year fraught with uncertainties and challenges. As such, it is opportune for the CRO to step forward and show their value to the organisation by advising the business leaders on their strategy execution programme so that these are well integrated and embedded with good risk management practices.
This roundtable discussion will be led and facilitated by Axcelasia Inc’s Group Executive Director,  Ranjit Singh and Axcelasia Columbus’ Managing Director, Derek Lee, both of whom  have collectively assisted more than 100 organisations on their risk management improvement journey, which includes performance assessment of the risk management function, risk action planning, key risk indicators implementation, special risk assessment exercises (involving investment, project, product, process), etc.   
Ranjit and Derek will moderate the session to allow participants to voice out the challenges faced in their day-to-day risk management work and sharing their experiences in managing the risk management function in their respective organisations. 
Ranjit and Derek will also provide insights into some of the latest global developments on risk management implementation. Do not miss this opportunity to participate and network with other experienced CROs to expand your horizon and sharpen your risk management skills.  


Seats are limited, please contact Fitriyani at fi@axcelasia.com or 03 2181 8865 to reserve your seat.     
Date: Between 6-9 March 2017
Venue: Axcelasia Inc., Wisma Goldhill, Kuala Lumpur.
