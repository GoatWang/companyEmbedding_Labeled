Poultry-by-product Meal (PBM):
Poultry by-product meal is one of the most important source of animal protein used to feed domestic animals. It is made by combining the by-products coming from poultry slaughterhouses or poultry processing plants. The AAFCO (USA) defines PBM as the combination of ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered poultry, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidably...

CSP Inc. is proud to introduce "Emulsifiers" to our product portfolio. Emulsifiers have rapidly become a desirable component of animal diets. 
Dietary fat provides the required energy for high performance in modern agriculture. However, much of this fat energy is wasted as it passes through the gastro-intestinal tract undigested and unabsorbed. To maximize the return on your investment in dietary fats, we recommend a range of natural emulsifiers and absorption enhancers suitable for use in all species of animal.

Our emulsifiers (aka biosurfactants) change the way the villi membranes behave, promoting absorption. Its ability to form natural liposomes in the GI tract due to its ampiphilic structure...

CSP Inc. provides custom blending service for our different Probiotics species to meet specific client formulation and application needs.
Probiotics are a class of “good” or “friendly” bacteria that are inhabitants of the intestinal tract, which helps in digestion. They aid in digestion by breaking down foods into their component parts for absorption into the body. “Bad” or “pathogenic” bacteria on the other hand, can cause intestinal micro flora imbalances that lead to illness and diseases.
Probiotics are aimed at promoting the growth of beneficial gut microbes or in some way rendering others less pathogenic.The term ‘competitive exclusion’ is often used synonymously with...

Custom blending service of trace minerals, designed to meet specific client formulation and application needs, provides a tailored experience for every customer.
The importance of essential trace minerals on livestock productivity has been realized for several decades. In improved agricultural systems, the supplementation of essential trace minerals has lead to increased livestock production as measured by body weight gain and reproductive performance. Recently, the importance of trace mineral nutrition on immune competence in livestock has gained attention. Researchsupporting these efforts has focused on multiple areas of immunity, including both specific and non-specific branches of the immune...

CSP Inc. provides a wide range of enzymes used in animal feed including several fiber-degrading enzymes, proteases and phytases.
All animals use enzymes to digest feed. These are either produced by the animal itself, or by the microbes naturally present in the gut. However, the animal’s digestive process is not 100% efficient. Pigs and poultry cannot digest 15–25% of the feed they eat, because the feed ingredients contain indigestible anti-nutritional factors that interfere with the digestive process and/or the animal lacks specific enzymes that break down certain components in the feed.
In many animal production systems feed is the biggest single cost, and on-farm profitability can depend...

I truly appreciate your soldering products as well as your excellent website and presentation. Thanks a lot for your tools, very rare in the era of cheap junk at very high prices. I guess the question is would I buy again?...I just did.

The parts I ordered are correct, timely delivered and functional. I would do business with American Hakko now and in the future. I also have other associates who have the same tools and suggested they contact Hakko as I did.

Concentrated Solar Power


CSP represents the most potential for providing energy from sunlight.
Most people are familiar with images of the giant utility scale heliostat fields reflecting sunlight on a central tower where the heat gets used to produce steam for turbine generators.
There are many other kinds of solar concentrating systems including parabolic dishes, troughs, Fresnel mirrors, Stirling engine systems, and CPV. Recently there have been several large heliostat projects which represent one form of active CSP. Parabolic troughs are the best example of an effective semi-passive CSP.
Home CSP manufactures our own parabolic ribs and heat fins for standard and compound parabolic trough applications. These pre-cut panels make assembling your own parabolic trough as easy as possible.
CSP may also be categorized by application: electricity, heat, or light. Photo-voltaic systems can benefit from CSP, but conventional PV cells suffer from the fact that their output voltage goes down as temperature increases.  Some systems use special high temperature cells, while others utilize the excess heat by transferring it to a fluid for other use in what is called a Combined Heat and Power system (CHP)
Current CSP market analyses have focused entirely on utility scale projects involving both heliostat and parabolic trough reflector systems. The energy from these projects is ultimately intended largely for domestic and small business use, so forecasts for market investment of $80 billion in CSP over the next decade are certainly a reflection of the consumer demand. As the home CSP market has been completely ignored by the solar industry, transitioning a profitable product from novelty item to mass market represents a huge opportunity.


While energy in sunlight peaks in the visible frequencies, nearly half of the energy in sunlight is in the form of heat, i.e. infrared, and often we need energy in the home to make heat.
By concentrating the sun’s power on a smaller area, greater heat transfer efficiency is achieved, and by manipulating solar light with mirrors, we can transport the heat to where it is needed without having to convert it to electricity first, yielding an even more dramatic efficiency advantage.


,

At a basic level there are two forms of concentrated solar energy: active and passive.
Active systems employ motors to track the sun and maximize efficiency
Passive systems simply attempt to gather as much energy as possible in a static configuration.

Why now?
Recent developments in microprocessors and embedded software technology have allowed the creation low-cost specialized controllers capable of the sophisticated analysis needed to make CSP convenient, practical, and affordable. By combining the latest micro-electronics technology with physics, and astronomy, and applying results to the needs of the home, a truly new paradigm of energy usage is possible. With rising energy prices and widespread insecurity due to dependence on problematic sources, why not utilize the energy falling on your home for free already? You’ll enjoy peace of mind as well as one less bill.

Company Introduces Myri-10G Product with 10GBASE-T Interface Delivering Key Technology Enhancements
BILLERICA, MA, December 16, 2013 – CSP Inc. (NASDAQ: CSPI), a provider of IT solutions, systems integration services and dense cluster computing systems, today announced that it is enhancing the Myricom 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter product line by adding 10GBASE-T support. With this interface, the Myri-10G products can now deliver 10Gigabit/second speeds over a familiar RJ45 Ethernet connector and twisted pair cables for a number of different customer applications.
Adoption of 10GBASE-T Ethernet ports had been slow due to their high cost and high power consumption compared to available 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) alternatives.  However, recent advances in semiconductor technology have dramatically changed both parameters and are now driving strong growth.  According to Crehan Research, 10GBASE-T is the fastest growing 10GbE connectivity solution in data centers and is expected to exceed all other alternatives by 2015, reaching more than 30 million ports in 2016.  But data centers are only one of the markets that require fast network transfer speeds and the convenience of 10GBASE-T.
“The Video Content Creation market has already embraced 10GBASE-T because of the high 10 Gigabit Ethernet wire speed and the convenience of running up to 100 meters on standard CAT 6a cables,” said Ron Amborn, President/CEO of Maxx Digital, a leading provider of cutting edge storage solutions for the feature film industry.  “We have a long relationship with Myricom and are very excited about both the 10GBASE-T introduction and CSPI’s investments in the Myri-10G product family.”
“The Machine Vision market embraced Gigabit Ethernet with the GigE Vision Standard and is now ready to transition to 10GbE,” according to John Ilett, President of Emergent Vision Technologies, which develops ultra-high speed cameras for industrial and machine vision applications.  “We have worked closely with Myricom and their MVA software and are pleased to see the 10GBASE-T enhancement.  Our customers want the high throughput provided by 10GbE along with the convenience of running through CAT 6a cables.”
“We are very pleased with the market acceptance of our 10GBASE-T announcement,” said William Bent VP/GM MultiComputer Division of CSPI.  “We are focused on delivering key networking technology enhancements through the Myricom product family to our existing customers and the broader market.  This is the first in a series of innovations we will be announcing over the coming months.”
Evaluation samples of the 10GBASE-T versions of the Myri-10G adapters will be available in Q1, 2014.
