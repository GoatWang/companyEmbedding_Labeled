 - asknet AG to start operating Phantom Drive Gold Shop of H+H Software GmbH  - Outlook for the 2008 financial year  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ots.CorporateNews transmitted by euro adhoc. The issuer is responsible for
  the content of this announcement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- companies Karlsruhe (euro adhoc) - 4 July 2008 - With the conclusion of an agreement with Panda Security, asknet AG succeeded in enlisting a leading provider of anti-malware solutions. PANDA supplies one of the most popular anti-virus software packages for private and business customers with more than 2.5 million customers worldwide. By entering the partnership with asknet, PANDA aims at further stepping up its online business. "Both its technological competence and its worldwide network of partners convinced us of the capability of asknet AG," says Juan Santana, CEO of Panda Security.  As from now, the German company Lexware GmbH & CO. KG offers part of its product range as digital downloads via the asknet shop solution. "Up to now, our software has been marketed purely in the form of boxed products. For our venture into the electronic software market, we chose a competent and experienced partner in asknet," says Markus Griesbaum, senior project manager with Haufe.  H+H Software GmbH again opted for an online shop operated by asknet for marketing its new product Phantom Drive. H+H Software GmbH, which supplies what is probably the best known and most successful CD emulator called Virtual CD, presents the Phantom Drive, the world´s first virtual HD writer. Starting now, the product will be available for download in the regions of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa via the Phantom Drive Gold Shop operated by asknet AG. "Past positive experience with asknet AG in marketing our `Virtual CD´ product persuaded us to extend our partnership with asknet to include a second online shop," says Alexander Vierschrodt, Product Manager with H+H Software GmbH.  The cooperation with PANDA confirms the dynamic growth of the asknet Group particularly as regards further development in 2009. For 2008, the pronounced economic slow-down in the US and the constrictive revaluation of the euro against the dollar negatively impact the development of earnings in the asknet Group. Major acquisition projects in the first half of the year were delayed. Overall, therefore, the company expects growth in 2008 to be weaker than in the previous year.  Optimization measures on the structural cost side have already been implemented in order to adjust the use of resources to the temporarily lower growth. This causes one-off costs of app. EUR 250,000 in 2008. In 2009 the measures will lead to cost savings of app. EUR 500,000. "The asknet Group operates in a market and competitive environment where above-average growth rates can be achieved. Combined with the moderate cost side measures, the scalability of the business model will again be confirmed in future," says Gerald Prior, CEO of asknet AG.  About asknet: asknet AG, (Frankfurt A5A) leading in Global eCommerce, accelerates eSales for publishers in the digital marketplace.
