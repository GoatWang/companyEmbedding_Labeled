History[edit]




Neusoft Group's Headquarters in Shenyang, China


Neusoft was founded by Northeastern University professors Liu Jiren and Li Huatian in 1988 as the Computer Software and Network Engineering Research Laboratory of Northeastern University.[6] It had an initial allocation of three people, three computers, and capital of RMB 30,000.[7] In 1990 it became the NEU Computer Software Research and Development Centre.[6] It was incorporated in 1991.[7] They had a collaboration with Alpine Electronics of Japan and the venture was called Neu-Alpine Software Research Institute.[6] Through technical export and software outsourcing, this made Alpine their first international customer. The entity then became the Neu-Alpine Software Co. Ltd in 1993.[6] As CEO, Liu Jiren led the company in these developments.[4]
The first stages of construction of Neusoft Park began in 1995; around the same time, Neusoft incorporated the NEU Computer Imaging Centre and began to investigate CT scanning and related medical technologies.[6] The NEU Software Group Ltd. was founded in 1996; one of its early collaborations was with Toshiba.[6] In 1996, Neusoft became the first listed software company in China, with an offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[7] A partnership with Bao Steel in 1998 broadened the firm's investor base.[7]
In 2003 there was a consolidation of investments as part of which Alpine Electronics, Toshiba, Bao Steel, and other investors became shareholders of Neusoft Group.[6] By 2004, Neusoft had some 6,000 employees across 40 offices around China and the world with sales of RMB 2.4 billion.[6]
By 2009 it was known as China's largest software outsourcing company.[8] It was however still well behind Indian giants in the sector such as Tata Group and Infosys.[8] By 2010 it had revenues of $540 million across a base of 15,000 employees, with some 8,000 corporate entities as customers.[9] Historically most of their customers are in China and Japan.[9]

History[edit]




Neusoft Group's Headquarters in Shenyang, China


Neusoft was founded by Northeastern University professors Liu Jiren and Li Huatian in 1988 as the Computer Software and Network Engineering Research Laboratory of Northeastern University.[6] It had an initial allocation of three people, three computers, and capital of RMB 30,000.[7] In 1990 it became the NEU Computer Software Research and Development Centre.[6] It was incorporated in 1991.[7] They had a collaboration with Alpine Electronics of Japan and the venture was called Neu-Alpine Software Research Institute.[6] Through technical export and software outsourcing, this made Alpine their first international customer. The entity then became the Neu-Alpine Software Co. Ltd in 1993.[6] As CEO, Liu Jiren led the company in these developments.[4]
The first stages of construction of Neusoft Park began in 1995; around the same time, Neusoft incorporated the NEU Computer Imaging Centre and began to investigate CT scanning and related medical technologies.[6] The NEU Software Group Ltd. was founded in 1996; one of its early collaborations was with Toshiba.[6] In 1996, Neusoft became the first listed software company in China, with an offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[7] A partnership with Bao Steel in 1998 broadened the firm's investor base.[7]
In 2003 there was a consolidation of investments as part of which Alpine Electronics, Toshiba, Bao Steel, and other investors became shareholders of Neusoft Group.[6] By 2004, Neusoft had some 6,000 employees across 40 offices around China and the world with sales of RMB 2.4 billion.[6]
By 2009 it was known as China's largest software outsourcing company.[8] It was however still well behind Indian giants in the sector such as Tata Group and Infosys.[8] By 2010 it had revenues of $540 million across a base of 15,000 employees, with some 8,000 corporate entities as customers.[9] Historically most of their customers are in China and Japan.[9]
