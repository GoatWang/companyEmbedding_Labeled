Origin[edit]
Sasken Communication began as the brainchild of Rajiv C Mody, its chairman and CEO, and 3 other co-founders, Krishna Jhaveri, Suresh Dholakia, and Badru Agarwala. Sasken came into being as Silicon Automation Systems (SAS) in 1989 in a small warehouse in Fremont, California. Later, the company changed its name to Sasken Communication Technologies Limited in order to cater to the growing opportunities in the telecommunication space around the world. The name 'Sasken' is an amalgamation of its original name (SAS) and the Scottish word for knowledge, 'ken'.[citation needed]
In February 2017, Sasken announced that it had changed its name to Sasken Technologies Limited to serve customers in businesses ranging from automotive, smart devices and wearables, industrials, enterprises, satellite, and retail.
