Product Spotlight


Genesis has developed a unique method to remove heat from chips requiring cooling as well as shielding.

As board-mounted chips continue to increase in speed,  the demand for shielding the chip has, in turn, increased.  When chips need to be shielded, as well  as requiring a heatsink, a new problem presents itself. Genesis has developed  a unique way to remove heat from chips that
need cooling as well as shielding.
