Part-Time Startup
The iBosses Part-Time Startup Programme allows anybody with the passion to start running their own business to do so with ease as never before.Firstly, aspiring entrepreneurs can start their business at a greatly reduced cost, obliterating the myth that entrepreneurship requires a large amount of capital. Participants in this programme need not hire extra manpower or contract third-party personnel as they can outsource almost any business related work to iBosses staff and we will do the work for them. Also, we will introduce plenty of free or affordable platforms and tools that they can use to run their business, keeping starting and running costs as low as possible.Secondly, as the name Part-Time Startup suggests, participants of the programme can learn and build their business at their own pace, meaning that they do not need to disrupt their present commitments while running their startup. Using mobile applications to keep in touch with us, learn on-the-go, keep track of their business progress and many more at the convenience of their fingertips, iBosses simplifies and mobilizes the entire process of entrepreneurship.Thirdly, the Part-Time Startup Programme makes it possible and effortless for anyone without prior skills and knowledge in business, IT, or any other technical aspects to create their own business from scratch. iBosses will teach, provide aid whenever required and be there to guide participants every step of the way.





Model and Methodology
They have identified gaps in the market and business industry, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to venture into.Youth who are keen on becoming their own boss, working adults who seek novelty and to deviate from their mundane routines, senior citizens who wish for adventure even after retirement…there are multiple reasons why people advance into the career of an entrepreneur. However, not all of them have the skills and knowledge to succeed in entrepreneurship.The iBosses’ Maturity Model supports nascent entrepreneurs by identifying the stages they are at with respect to their level of understanding in the field of entrepreneurship. Their consultants will evaluate them based on their existing ideas, skills and knowledge in their respective ventures to guide them onto their next step towards success. Their 8-Level iBosses Entrepreneurship Maturity Model™ ensures an efficient, adaptable and comprehensive approach for your startup.





Training
Entrepreneurship courses offered in institutions and universities generally have a rigid curriculum and limited content. Also, they tend to be academic-driven, which deprive learners of the freedom to experiment and explore with entrepreneurism.iBosses believes in a holistic approach towards entrepreneurship training. They equip their students with knowledge as well as technical and soft entrepreneurial skills. This is through personal mentoring, case studies and giving mentees a first-hand experience in starting up businesses. In this way, we hope to fill in the gaps in the syllabus of institutions and boost the prospects and achievements of young entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurialism appears to be on the rise in Australia. Over the past two decades, the proportion of our labour force managing their own business has risen from less than four per cent to over seven per cent. Most recent Bureau of Statistics data from 2012 indicates the number of Australian’s owning and managing an incorporated enterprise was growing at a faster pace than any other form of employment. 
To support this trend, the Federal Government operates an Entrepreneurs Program which provides reimbursement for eligible projects for up to half the cost of engaging external expertise (up to a maximum of $20,000) to make business improvements. Also significant is the Research and Development Tax Incentive, which reimburses up to 43.5cents in the Dollar for eligible expenditures. 
By comparison, the Government of Singapore has instituted major funding initiatives to foster a more focused wave of innovation by start up technology companies. It has established an Early Stage Venture Fund which invests up to $10 million on a one-to-one basis with seed venture capital funds. For smaller and less advanced start ups, programs are in place to provide Proof-Of-Concept Grants of up to $250,000, and co investments for up to $500,000 alongside designated technology incubators. The coming listing of iBosses Corporation aims to capitalise on the favourable policy climate for start up ventures in Singapore by providing educational services to entrepreneurs.
Proceeds from its Initial Public Offer are ear marked for acquisitions of complimentary businesses, expansion of its learning centres and development of digital delivery capabilities. Incentive for new investors lay in the traction gained since its incorporation in August 2014. During the nine months to March 2015, iBosses has recorded revenue of $1.4million and procured licensees for its educational products in Malaysia and Singapore. 
Primary risks surrounding the float relate to iBosses limited operating history.  Its published accounts for the nine months ending March 2015 were not accompanied by cash flow records and are not representative of its sustainable financial performance. It is not clear whether the Company will remain reliant on external capital following its Initial Public Offer. Faced with limited competitive barriers and possibly cyclical demand, new investors should require very speculative appetite or a more sustained performance history.
