IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924.
IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and offers hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2017) for 24 consecutive years.[5] Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.
IBM has continually shifted its business mix by commoditizing markets focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and selling off its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), and The Weather Company (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go "fabless", continuing to design semiconductors, but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries. As of 2017, IBM has the most patents in "Cloud Computing" in the world.[6]
Nicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as "IBMers", IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology and five National Medals of Science.

History[edit]
Main article: History of IBM
In the 1880's, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of what would become International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885;[7] Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[8] Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine;[9] and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.[10] On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[1][11] The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR.[12] Watson joined CTR as General Manager then, 11 months later, was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[13] Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies.[14] He implemented sales conventions, "generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker".[15][16] His favorite slogan, "THINK", became a mantra for each company's employees.[15] During Watson's first four years, revenues more than doubled to $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[15] "Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR" and in 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title "International Business Machines".[17] By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[18]

In 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the U.S. Government, during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act,[19] and Hitler's Third Reich,[20][21] largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag. During the Second World War the company produced small arms for the American war effort (M1 Carbine, and Browning Automatic Rifle).
In 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.[22] In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son Thomas Watson, Jr. was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.

On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.[23]
In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code.[24] IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.[25] The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer Lexmark.
In 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history.[26] Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around.[27] In 2002, IBM acquired PwC consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees. The result was three values: "Dedication to every client's success", "Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world", and "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships".[28][29]

In 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo[30] and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa, and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.[31]
In 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for a fee of $2.1 billion.[32] Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc.,[33][34] Twitter,[35] Facebook,[36] Tencent,[37] Cisco,[38] UnderArmour,[39] Box,[40] Microsoft,[41] VMware,[42] CSC,[43] Macy's,[44] Sesame Workshop,[45] the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.[46]
In 2015, IBM announced two major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion[47] and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app.[48][49] Also that year, IBMers created the film A Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit.[50][51] In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.[52] The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[53]
Headquarters and offices[edit]

IBM is headquartered in Armonk, New York, a community 37 miles (60 km) north of Midtown Manhattan.[54] Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a 283,000-square-foot (26,300 m2) glass and stone edifice on a 25-acre (10 ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s.[55] There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM's headquarters; and the IBM Learning Center (ILC), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.[56]
IBM operates in 170 countries as of 2016,[2] with mobility centers in smaller markets areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City, IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including the IBM Watson headquarters at Astor Place in Manhattan. Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States include Austin, Texas; Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina; Rochester, Minnesota; and Silicon Valley, California.
IBM's real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include 1250 René-Lévesque (Montreal, Canada), Tour Descartes (Paris, France), and One Atlantic Center (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). In Beijing, China, IBM occupies Pangu Plaza, which is the city's seventh tallest building and overlooks Beijing National Stadium ("Bird's Nest"), which was home to the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Other notable buildings include the IBM Rome Software Lab (Rome, Italy), the Hursley House (Winchester, UK), 330 North Wabash (Chicago, Illinois, United States), the Cambridge Scientific Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States), the IBM Toronto Software Lab (Toronto, Canada), the IBM Building, Johannesburg (Johannesburg, South Africa), the IBM Building (Seattle) (Seattle, Washington, United States), the IBM Hakozaki Facility (Tokyo, Japan), the IBM Yamato Facility (Yamato, Japan), and the IBM Canada Head Office Building (Ontario, Canada). Defunct IBM campuses include the IBM Somers Office Complex (Somers, New York). The company's contributions to industrial architecture and design include works by Eero Saarinen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and I.M. Pei. Van der Rohe's building in Chicago, the original center of the company's research division post-World War II, was recognized with the 1990 Honor Award from the National Building Museum.[57] IBM was recognized as one of the Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2005, which recognized Fortune 500 companies that provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution.[58] In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM's contribution in its early days to pollution in its original location in Endicott, New York.[59][60]

IBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016, these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, cognitive computing, commerce, data and analytics, Internet of Things,[61] IT infrastructure, mobile, and security.[62]
IBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers.[63] IBM also offers Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.[64]
IBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect each year.[65]
Hardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's POWER microprocessors, which are employed inside many console gaming systems, including Xbox 360,[66] PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii U.[67][68] IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors,[69] and in 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 billion over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.[70] In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.[71]
IT outsourcing also represents a major service offered by IBM, with more than 40 data centers worldwide.[72] alphaWorks is IBM's source for emerging software technologies, and SPSS is a software package used for statistical analysis. IBM's Kenexa suite provides employment and retention solutions, and includes the BrassRing, an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies for recruiting.[73] IBM also owns The Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includes weather.com and Weather Underground.
Smarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress,[74][75] targeting opportunities such as smart grids,[76] water management systems,[77] solutions to traffic congestion,[78] and greener buildings.[79]
Services offerings include Redbooks, which are publicly available online books about best practices with IBM products, and developerWorks, a website for software developers and IT professionals with how-to articles and tutorials, as well as software downloads, code samples, discussion forums, podcasts, blogs, wikis, and other resources for developers and technical professionals.[80]
IBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data.[81] Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game-show Jeopardy!, where it competed against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings.[82] Also, several companies have begun using Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents.[83]
Research[edit]

Research has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.[84] IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, Tokyo lab, Zurich lab and Africa lab in Nairobi.
In terms of investment, IBM's R&D spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9 billion USD.[85] Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for Watson in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's "strategic imperatives" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.[86]
IBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began supporting Linux in 1998.[87] The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center, which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers.[88] IBM has also released code under different open source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation),[89] the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM's open source involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see SCO v. IBM).
Famous inventions and developments by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time.[90] A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.[5]
Five IBMers have received the Nobel Prize: Leo Esaki, of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the scanning tunneling microscope;[91] and Georg Bednorz and Alex Müller, also of Zurich, in 1987, for research in superconductivity. Several IBMers have also won the Turing Award, including the first female recipient Frances E. Allen.[92]
Current research includes a collaboration with the University of Michigan to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university,[93] and a partnership with AT&T, combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable and to provide developers with easier tools.[94]
Brand and reputation[edit]

IBM is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and color scheme,[95][96] and also partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[95][97] The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand.[98] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render large areas well.
IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[99] As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club.[100] IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open.[101] The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960-2000,[102] and the National Football League from 2003-2012.[103]
In 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by Interbrand as the №2 best brand worldwide.[104] That same year, it was also ranked the №1 company for leaders (Fortune), the №2 green company in the U.S. (Newsweek),[105] the №2 most respected company (Barron's),[106] the №5 most admired company (Fortune), the №18 most innovative company (Fast Company), and the №1 in technology consulting and №2 in outsourcing (Vault).[107] In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM the №5 most valuable brand.[108]

IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as "IBMers". The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO Thomas J. Watson, Jr. published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Human Rights Campaign has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,[109] with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use genetic information in employment decisions; and in 2015, IBM was named to Working Mother's 100 Best Companies List for the 30th consecutive year.[110]
IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),[111] which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the Peace Corps and gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad.[112] For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.[113]
The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).[114] Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company's most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.
IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.[115] During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.[116] The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying is stands for "I've Been Moved" due to relocations and layoffs,[117] others saying it stands for "I'm By Myself" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,[118] and others saying it stands for "I'm Being Mentored" due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.[119] In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing,[120] although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.[121] In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the "Big Blue".[122]
In 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a PC or a Mac as their primary work device, resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop.[123] In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.[124]

Thomas Watson Sr.
“It is the policy of this company never to be satisfied with what we have and always to anticipate the demands of the future.” This quote captures the vision of Thomas Watson Sr. who forged the disparate pieces of C-T-R into a strong, unified company that became International Business Machines.

C: The Computing Scale Company
In 1891, Edward Canby and Orange O. Ozias, two businessmen from Dayton, Ohio, purchased patents for the newly invented computing scale and created the Computing Scale Company for the production of commercial scales.








T: The Tabulating Machine Company
Drawing on his experience at the US Census Bureau from 1879 to 1882, Herman Hollerith applied for his first series of tabulating machine technology patents in 1884. In 1886, Hollerith developed the punched card to standardize the machines’ data input. The inventions were intended to reduce the time and complexity of tabulating the 1890 US Census.








R: The International Time Recording Company
The International Time Recording Company (ITR) began as the Bundy Manufacturing Company in Auburn, New York. ITR’s main product line was mechanical time recorders invented and patented by Willard L. Bundy.








C-T-R is born
In 1911, financier Flint directed the merger of the International Time Recording Company, the Computing Scale Company and the Tabulating Machine Company to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R). In 1914, Thomas J. Watson Sr. was named general manager of C-T-R. Watson emphasized research and engineering.








C-T-R is renamed IBM
In 1924, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company adopted the name International Business Machines Corporation. The ornate “C-T-R” logo was replaced by the words “Business Machines” in more modern sans-serif type, shaped in a sphere to resemble a globe, encircled by the word “International.”














The Making of IBM
The story doesn't stop here. Visit The Making of International Business Machines Icon of Progress to learn more.





 

The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, the precursor to IBM, was founded on June 16, 1911. At its beginning, it was a merger of three manufacturing businesses, a product of the times orchestrated by the financier, Charles Flint.  From these humble beginnings sprang the company that Thomas Watson Sr. would mold into a global force in technology, management and culture.


In 1911, biplanes dotted the air and Ford Model Ts appeared in the streets. Forward-thinking people wired their homes for electricity and installed their first telephones. In a Belfast shipyard, workers were finishing the hull of the biggest passenger ship ever, the 
Titanic. The booming US economy was creating a new hunger for information. There was a need to keep track, to understand and to inform.
Into that milieu stepped financier Charles Ranlett Flint. He worked out of an office on Broad Street, just off New York’s Wall Street, and invested in shipbuilding, munitions, rubber, starch and the production of caramel. By the early 1900s, Flint had become friends with Theodore Roosevelt, William McKinley, Orville Wright, Andrew Carnegie and other giants of politics and business.
Starting in 1900, Flint attempted to build a number of trusts by merging several small companies to create one dominant player.
One of these trusts was in time clocks—the kind factory workers would punch on the way in and out of work. The clocks helped employers keep track of hours worked and hourly wages. Flint took a number of companies that made recording time clocks, including the time recording business of Bundy Manufacturing in Binghamton, NY, rolled all the companies into one and called it International Time Recording Co. (ITR).

Around the same time, Flint rolled up several companies that made computing scales, which weighed items and added up the cost of whatever was placed on the scale. One of the largest of those companies was the Dayton Scale Company of Dayton, Ohio. Flint rolled all the companies into the Computing Scale Company of America, and made Dayton the trust’s headquarters.

Through the early 1900s, ITR grew modestly and Computing Scale struggled. Flint, searching for a way to help the companies, realized that both were, at their core, about collecting, quantifying and analyzing information—a mission that would actually be the mainstay of the company through the next century.
He was also at the time becoming interested in another information-based company, Herman Hollerith’s Tabulating Machine Co., based in Washington, DC. Hollerith had built the tabulating machine to count the 1890 US Census. It sorted and counted information recorded by punching holes in cards, and Hollerith had begun selling the machines to governments, railroad companies and retailers.
In 1911, Flint bought out Hollerith, and then merged the Tabulating Machine Co. with Computing Scale, ITR and what remained of the Bundy Manufacturing Co. The new information-based entity was named the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, or C-T-R. Headquarters moved to New York, and the company operated factories in Endicott, NY, Dayton, Ohio and a few other cities.
Very quickly, Hollerith’s tabulator emerged as the most promising technology in C-T-R’s catalog. Before the merger, the machines had been used to conduct population censuses in a variety of countries, including Austria, Canada, Denmark and Russia. Not only could the machines count faster, but they could understand information in new ways. In a census, for instance, a single card, about three inches by seven inches, could be punched with holes that form an information portrait of a person—city of residence, age, nationality, job and more. Hollerith’s contraptions were able to sort through millions of cards and count how many teachers lived in Chicago, Illinois, or count any other subset of the population. Society could learn things it never knew it could learn, and at speeds no one thought possible.
Businesses quickly realized that the portraits on those cards didn’t have to be citizens, but of a product a company sells, or a freight car on a rail line, or an insurance customer. Early adopters of the electric tabulation method included the freight office of the New York Central Railroad and the Eastman Kodak Company, which used a tabulating machine to keep track of customers and salesmen.
Despite the progress the tabulating machine line was making, as a whole C-T-R stalled in its first years after the merger. So, in 1914, Flint hired Thomas Watson Sr. to run the company. It turned out to be an inspired move.
Over the following decade, Watson forged the disparate pieces of C-T-R into a unified company with a strong culture. He focused resources on the tabulating machine business, foreseeing that information technology had an ever-expanding future and literally creating the information industry.
Watson also began expanding overseas—beyond the UK, Canada and Germany where its products were already sold—taking tiny C-T-R global. By 1924, he renamed C-T-R with the more expansive name of International Business Machines.
The computing scale and time clock businesses fell away. IBM grew to become the most significant player in every stage of the evolution of information technology over the 100 years after it was first formed.

In 1911, C-T-R had US$800,000 in net income. In 2010, IBM’s net income was US$14.8 billion. One IBM share in 1915, adjusted for all splits and stock dividends, would be equal to 11,880 shares today.
Through the years, the company has changed ideas about how corporations should operate, and contributed cultural touchstones such as the THINK signs, punched cards, the

 Selectric typewriter, the IBM PC and the Watson computer that won the 
Jeopardy! TV game show in 2011.
It has been a rich and historic century.



Words from Charles Flint




“I had the leisure to turn to a field which has since interested me more than any other one—that is, the consolidation of corporations, the forming of what used to be known as ‘trusts.’ I have been called ‘the father of trusts,’ although sometimes I think I have been more nearly in the relation of godfather.”

“Fifty Years a Trader,” System: The Magazine of Business

“In 1911 I made a departure from the practice of bringing about consolidations in single industries by effecting a consolidation of allied interests, that is by consolidating the manufacturers of similar but no identical products. The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. is of this class and although it is not the largest of the consolidations in which I have acted as organizer, it has been the most successful.”

Memories of an Active Life: Men, and Ships, and Sealing Wax

1923



At the outset of [C-T-R], I pointed out to the Guaranty Trust Co. that the proposed ‘allied consolidation,’ instead of being dependent for earnings upon a single industry, would own three separate and distinct lines of business, so that in normal times the interest and sinking funds on its bonds could be earned by any one of these independent lines, while in abnormal times the consolidation would have three chances instead of one to meet its obligations and pay dividends. … The advantages to be realized by allied consolidations have been fully demonstrated by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, under the leadership of its president, Thomas J. Watson.”

In 1916, two years after Thomas Watson Sr. had been running CTR, Charles Flint wrote the person who had referred Watson to him, “Watson is living up to your predictions. If in your travels you run across another Watson, I hope you’ll remember me again.”

Charles R. Flint
Founder of C-T-R, precursor to IBM



“The future of this business, gentlemen, and our future success, depends to a great extent on the progress we make along the lines of development, and along the lines of expansion into new fields and into lines we are not touching today... We must progress and we can’t do it any other way. We can not stand still on development work.”

After a modest rural childhood near Ithaca, New York, Thomas J. Watson got his start in business in sales. He worked first for himself—as a traveling peddler—and later at the National Cash Register Company (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio, where he was a sales manager and ascended into the executive ranks over a decade-plus tenure. From NCR, Watson became general manager of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (C-T-R), moving with his young family to New York City in May 1914 to lead C-T-R, whose name he would change to International Business Machines a decade later. As IBM’s founding chairman, Watson built a powerful tabulating machine business that became a business icon. Credited with defining IBM’s distinctive management style and creating its corporate culture, Watson also became the nation’s foremost celebrity businessman. His coining of the “THINK” motto solidified his lifelong success as a salesman and marketer. Watson brought explosive growth to IBM: At the time of his death in 1956, IBM boasted nearly US$900 million in annual revenues—one hundred times C-T-R’s annual revenues when Watson took charge of the company in 1914.

Charles Ranlett Flint was born in 1850 in Thomaston, Maine. The ambitious Flint showed early signs of promise when at age 21 he became partner at a New York ships’ supplies firm. The next year, Flint reached even further to a partnership at the international shipping firm W. R. Grace and Co. Over the course of his business life, Flint formed numerous relationships with diplomats, politicians and industrial visionaries, and became a trusted voice on international affairs. He served, at separate times, as consul at New York for Chile, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and was appointed a delegate to the International American Conference (1889-90) in Washington where he proposed the creation of an international bank for the promotion of foreign trade. Flint formed some 21 industrial consolidations or mergers in his time, including C-T-R—the precursor to IBM—where he hired Thomas Watson Sr. Such a prolific business career earned him the moniker “The Father of Trusts.” He retired from business affairs in 1931.




Herman Hollerith 






Herman Hollerith was born in Buffalo, New York, on February 29, 1860. He dropped out of grade school at a young age but studied under a private tutor until he could apply to Columbia College. He was admitted at the age of 16 and graduated three years later as a mining engineer. Hollerith went on to join the US Census Office in 1879, and quickly saw the need for faster, more efficient tabulation of census data. In 1884, he filed his first patents, and began manufacturing his statistics tabulating machines in Baltimore in 1887. His machines counted the 1890 census and results were available two years earlier than the 1880 census. The entire process cost an estimated US$5 million less than manual tabulation. In 1911, Hollerith’s Tabulating Machine Company merged with two other companies under the auspices of Charles Flint to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, or C-T-R. Hollerith enjoyed smoking good cigars, drinking fine wine and raising Guernsey cows.

International Business Machines Corp. Has Bought Back Nearly 14 Million Shares So Far in 2017. Should Investors Be Happy?
Big Blue continues to buy back shares, but is that a good thing for shareholders, or a waste of capital?

As with most things, there's a right time and a wrong time for a company to repurchase stock. While it generally sounds good from a public-relations perspective no matter the timing, a company that's enjoying a sky-high stock price could probably find better things to do with its free cash than buying back stock at historically high valuations.
IBM (NYSE:IBM) shareholders, however, needn't worry that their company's ongoing share-repurchasing  initiative is coming at ridiculously high prices, because its stock remains woefully inexpensive compared with its peers. The 14 million shares IBM has repurchased so far in 2017, let alone the 401.1 million since the end of 2008, haven't had the positive impact CEO Ginni Rometty and team had hoped for.

The upside
By the end of the second quarter report  on July 18, IBM had 939.6 million shares outstanding, down nearly 21 million from a year ago. Though IBM spent a whopping $1.4 billion on share buybacks last quarter, as well as another $1.4 billion in dividends, it still boasts cash and equivalents of $11.7 billion, well above last year's $7.83 billion.
As Rometty continues to transform IBM from old-school enterprise hardware to one of the leading cloud providers on the planet, it could be argued that its fairly aggressive repurchase efforts will eventually pay off. Buying back stock while IBM's stock price is under pressure is a sign of a management team confident in its future.
There are reasons for optimism, particularly the continued growth in IBM's critical strategic-imperatives results, which include cloud, data security, cognitive computing, and mobile solutions. Combined, the all-important group of cutting-edge technologies generated $8.8 billion of IBM's $19.3 billion in sales last quarter, equal to just shy of 46% of total revenue.





The highlight of IBM's second quarter was its $8.8 billion annual cloud-as-a-service revenue run rate. Software-as-a-service  (SaaS) and business-process-as-a-service (BPaaS) are expected to generate a combined $79.4 billion in revenue this year, and SaaS sales alone will nearly double to $75.7 billion in just three years.
IBM also generated $15.1 billion in cloud revenue the past 12 months, which puts it in rarefied  air with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its trailing 12 months of $18.1 billion in cloud sales. Similar to IBM, Microsoft is also targeting the SaaS and BPaaS market opportunities, and it's clearly working for both tech behemoths.
The downside
Instituting a share-buyback plan while a stock is under pressure makes sense, particularly if it positively affects the bottom line. With fewer shares outstanding, flat or even slightly lower revenue should result in comparatively solid per-share earnings results. But that's still not the case with IBM.
Despite its 21 million fewer shares compared with a year ago, let alone the 14 million fewer in 2017, IBM's per-share earnings excluding one-time items inched up just 1% to $2.97, versus last year's $2.62. By comparison, Microsoft is also in the midst of a share buyback, and it certainly helped its bottom line.





Last quarter, Microsoft's $89.5 billion in revenue was good for a 5% improvement, but with 123 million fewer shares available, its per-share earnings, excluding one-time items, soared 42% to $0.98. Keeping a good handle on expenses certainly played a key role in Microsoft's bottom-line results, but so, too, did its buyback initiative.
While it's true IBM's buyback efforts haven't had the positive impact some had hoped for, now is not the time to throw in the towel. Should investors be happy? Not yet, but with its stock down 12% this year and 10% the past 12 months, IBM investors will turn their frowns upside down in the long run.
