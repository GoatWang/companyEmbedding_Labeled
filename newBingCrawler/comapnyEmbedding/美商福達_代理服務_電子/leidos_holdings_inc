Leidos Completes Testing on Air Force's AgilePod™
Jul 25 17
Leidos recently completed testing of sensor systems on the Air Force's AgilePod™, an innovative multi-sensor platform. Leidos led AgilePod's design, integration and flight demonstration to showcase its open, flexible and scalable intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. AgilePod™ was built to accommodate and integrate multiple sensors onto operational systems. Leidos modified and integrated the platform to prepare the capability for initial flight demonstrations. This successful risk reduction test showed how open architectures along with common mechanical and electrical solutions can rapidly reconfigure sensors to support operational needs for multiple aircraft. The Leidos team demonstrated eight different sensors in five different configurations. Follow on flight tests are planned on the MQ-9 Reaper for later this year.

RESTON, Va., Aug. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:    LDOS) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a special cash dividend of $13.64 per outstanding share of Leidos common stock.  The dividend, totaling an aggregate payment of approximately $1.0 billion based on the current number of shares outstanding, is conditioned on the consummation of the previously announced combination of Lockheed Martin's realigned Information Systems & Global Solutions business (IS&GS) with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.  The special dividend is expected to be paid on or about August 22, 2016 to Leidos stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2016.  It is currently expected that Leidos common stock will trade "ex-dividend" on the New York Stock Exchange on August 17, 2016, the trading day immediately following the anticipated closing date of the IS&GS transaction.  Stockholders of record on the record date who sell their shares prior to the ex-dividend date will not receive the special cash dividend. 








The special dividend will be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under a previously announced new term loan and revolving credit facility to be entered into by Leidos prior to the closing of the IS&GS transaction.  
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of holding common stock to any particular stockholder will depend on the stockholder's particular tax circumstances. Leidos' stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences to them, in light of their particular investment or tax circumstances, of the receipt of the special dividend.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements 
The forward looking statements contained in this document involve risks and uncertainties that may affect Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s ("Leidos") operations, markets, products, services, prices and other factors as discussed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic, competitive, legal, governmental and technological factors. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the expectations of Leidos will be realized. This document also contains statements about the proposed business combination transaction between Leidos and Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"), in which Lockheed Martin will separate a substantial portion of its government information technology infrastructure services business and its technical services business, which have been realigned in the Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business segment, and combine this business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the "Transaction"). Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements with respect to the Transaction, including risks relating to the completion of the transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, the dependency of any split-off transaction on market conditions and the value to be received in any split-off transaction, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined company's operations, Leidos' ability to integrate the businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies, and the risk that disruptions from the Transaction will harm Leidos' business. While the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Leidos' consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. For a discussion identifying additional important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see Leidos' filings with the SEC, including  the prospectus included in the registration statement on Form S-4, the prospectus filed by Leidos pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3), Leidos' definitive proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders, as well as "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Risk Factors" in Leidos' annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended January 1, 2016, its Quarterly Reports filed on Form 10-Q, and such other filings that Leidos makes with the SEC from time to time, which are available at http://www.Leidos.com and at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Leidos assumes no obligation to provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.

Leidos, a spin-off of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[7] is an American defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Leidos works extensively with the United States Department of Defense (4th largest DoD contractor FY2012), the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community, including the NSA, as well as other U.S. government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.
Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense & Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense & Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service solutions, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.[8]
On September 27, 2013, SAIC changed its name to Leidos and spun off a new and independent $4 billion government services and information technology company which retains the name, Science Applications International Corporation, with Leidos being the primary successor to the original SAIC.[3][4] Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013,[7] making it number 240[9] on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.[4] In 2015, Leidos reported US$5.09 billion in revenue.
In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry's largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector.[10] As of August 2016, the company has 33,000 employees.[5][11]

The company was founded by J. Robert "Bob" Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI).[12][13]
SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006.[14] The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245B.[14]
In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.[15]
In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling the city over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract.[16] In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC's CityTime program manager, and his government contact were sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.[17]
In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.[18][19] The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper.[20] The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.[21] In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name "Science Applications International Corporation" and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to Leidos,[22] (created by clipping the word kaleidoscope) and would move its headquarters to Reston.[23]
Management[edit]

CEO: Roger Krone[24][25]

After more than 30 years of Beyster's leadership, Kenneth C. Dahlberg was named the CEO of SAIC in November 2003. In May 2005, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions.
The third CEO was Walt Havenstein, who pushed for tighter integration of the company's historically autonomous divisions, which led to lower profit and revenue. The strategy was reversed by the (fourth) CEO, retired Air Force general John P. Jumper, appointed in 2012.[26] On July 1, 2014 Leidos announced that Roger Krone will become its CEO on July 14, 2014.[24] As of 2017, Krone is the Chairman and CEO of Leidos.[25]
Operations[edit]
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 which was renamed Stargate Project.
In March 2001 SAIC defined the concept for the NSA Trailblazer Project. In 2002, NSA contracted SAIC for $280 million to produce a "technology demonstration platform" [clarification needed] for the agency's project, a "Digital Network Intelligence" system to analyze data carried on computer networks. Other project participants included Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton.[27] According to science news site PhysOrg.com, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier ThinThread program.[28] In 2005, NSA director Michael Hayden told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.[29]
In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did more than $2.6 billion in business with the United States Department of Defense, making it the ninth-largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts included a bid for information technology for the 2004 Olympics in Greece[30]
From 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the FBI's unsuccessful Virtual Case File project.[31]
During fiscal year 2012 (latest figure available), SAIC had more than doubled its business with the DoD to $5,988,489,000, and was the 4th-largest defense contractor on the annual list of the top 100.[32]

Customs and Border Control contract[edit]
In late 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency awarded Leidos with a $66 million contract. Leidos will provide mobile scanning systems to CBP, which will help border agents find illegal materials in vehicles and cargo. The scanners are called VACIS M6500. They allow agents to perform non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and cargo. Each day, CBP screens over 67,000 cargo containers. The contract calls for delivery of 22 VACIS M6500 scanners.[38]
Controversies[edit]
Revolving door[edit]
The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.
In 2012, 26 out of 35 SAIC Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.[39][40]
Campaign contributions[edit]
SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with $1,209,611 during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.[41]
FBI allegations[edit]
In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, "When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed."[this quote needs a citation]
SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had "fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money." He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered.[42] "There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period," Punaro said.[43]

RESTON, Va., Aug. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:   LDOS), a FORTUNE 500® science and technology solutions company, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.








Roger Krone, Leidos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Our second quarter performance exceeded expectations, and reflects our focus on delivering strong program performance to our customers while successfully integrating the IS&GS acquisition. Our results year-to-date give us confidence to increase our cost synergy targets for the transaction as well as our full year margin and earnings guidance. We remain committed to leveraging this transformational transaction to deliver value to our customers, employees, and shareholders."
Summary Results
Revenues for the quarter were $2.57 billion, compared to $1.29 billion in the prior year quarter. The current quarter increase was primarily due to $1.37 billion of revenue attributable to the Information Systems & Global Solutions business ("IS&GS Business") acquired from Lockheed Martin during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.
Operating income for the quarter was $166 million, compared to $75 million in the prior year quarter. Operating margin increased to 6.5% from 5.8% in the prior year quarter. The current quarter results include $67 million of amortization of intangible assets, $16 million of acquisition and integration costs, $9 million of amortization of equity method investments and $6 million of restructuring charges related to the acquisition of the IS&GS Business. The prior year quarter results included $15 million of acquisition and integration costs, $2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $1 million of restructuring charges.
Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") attributable to Leidos common stockholders for the quarter was $0.64, compared to $0.55 in the prior year quarter. Excluding the items mentioned above, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.04, compared to $0.68 in the prior year quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 153 million, up from 74 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to the issuance of approximately 77 million shares of Leidos common stock to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders in connection with the acquisition of the IS&GS Business.
Defense Solutions
Defense Solutions revenues for the quarter of $1,243 million increased by $458 million, or 58%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business and growth in our airborne programs, partially offset by reduced scope and completion of certain contracts.
Defense Solutions operating income margin for the quarter was 5.1%, compared to 7.6% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the quarter was 8.8%, compared to 7.6% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong performance on certain contracts and lower indirect costs.
Civil
Civil revenues for the quarter of $875 million increased by $575 million, or 192%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business, partially offset by the divestiture of the heavy construction business in fiscal 2016, and reduced scope and completion of certain contracts.
Civil operating income margin for the quarter was 7.5%, compared to 6.7% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income margin for the quarter was 11.0%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter, reflecting favorable adjustments on contracts.
Health
Health revenues for the quarter of $454 million increased by $251 million, or 124%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business, partially offset by lower revenues from our commercial health business due to timing.
On both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, Health operating income margin for the quarter was 16.3%, compared to 8.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to higher margins on IS&GS contracts.
Cash Flow Summary
Net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the quarter were $177 million compared to $72 million in the prior year quarter. The higher operating net cash inflows were primarily due to the timing of billing and collections activities, partially offset by higher payments for taxes and restructuring and integration expenses.
Net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations for the quarter were $9 million compared to net cash flows provided of $19 million in the prior year quarter. The $28 million increase in net cash used was primarily due to proceeds from the disposition of a business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 that did not recur in fiscal 2017 and increased payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations for the quarter were $112 million compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. The higher financing cash outflows were primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and higher dividend payments.
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had $262 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.2 billion of debt.
New Business Awards
Net business bookings totaled $2.7 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. 
Notable recent awards received include:

Veterans Benefits Administration: Leidos was awarded a multiple-award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to continue to provide medical disability examinations for the Veterans Benefits Administration. The contract has a one-year base period of performance, four one-year options, and a total contract ceiling of $6.8 billion, if all options are exercised. 
Defense Threat Reduction Agency: Leidos was awarded a contract by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ("DTRA") to support DTRA's Cooperative Biological Engagement Program and Cooperative Threat Reduction Program through a worldwide Scientific & Technical Engagement Partnership program. The single-award, time and materials contract has a one-year base period of performance, four one-year options, and a total contract value of approximately $170 million if all options are exercised. 
U.S. Army: Leidos was awarded a task order by the U.S. Army to provide program management solutions to the Department of Defense ("DoD") Biometrics program, including the DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System. The single-award cost-plus incentive-fee contract has a one-year base period of performance, four one-year options, and a total contract value of approximately $132 million, if all options are exercised. 
Intelligence Community: The Company was awarded contracts valued at $225 million, if all options are exercised, by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. Though the specific nature of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.

The Company's backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $17.1 billion, of which $5.0 billion was funded. 
Forward Guidance
As a result of the Company's year-to-date performance and updated expectations for the second half, the Company is updating guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. The updated guidance, which is based on a 12-month period from December 31, 2016, to December 29, 2017, is as follows:

Revenues of $10.1 billion to $10.4 billion versus the prior range of $10.0 billion to $10.4 billion; 
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.8% to 10.2% versus the prior range of 9.5% to 10.0%; 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.45 to $3.60, up from the previous range of $3.05 to $3.35; and 
Cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations at or above $475 million.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, asset impairment charges, restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration costs, amortization of equity method investments, gains and losses on disposal of assets and businesses and adjustments to the income tax provision to reflect non-GAAP exclusions. See Leidos' non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation included elsewhere in this release.
The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Because certain deductions for non-GAAP exclusions used to calculate projected net income (loss) may vary significantly based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amounts of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations being materially less than projected adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.UNAUDITED BACKLOG BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT(in millions)
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts.  Backlog value is based on management's estimates about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors, and excludes contracts that are under protest. Our estimate of backlog comprises both funded and negotiated unfunded backlog. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by several factors including modifications of contracts, non-exercise of options, foreign currency movements, etc.
Funded backlog for contracts with the U.S. Government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Funded backlog for contracts with non-U.S. Government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which Leidos is obligated to perform, less revenue previously recognized on the contracts.
Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), General Services Administration Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded or separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future task orders is anticipated.
The estimated value of backlog as of the dates presented was as follows:

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.UNAUDITED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(in millions, except per share amounts)
The Company uses and refers to non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations, which are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") and, accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide another measure of the Company's results of operations and financial condition, including its ability to comply with financial covenants. These non-GAAP measures are frequently used by financial analysts covering Leidos and its peers. The Company's computation of its non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, thus limiting their use for comparability.
Non-GAAP operating income is computed by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations: (i) other income (expense), net; (ii) interest expense; (iii) interest income; (iv) income tax expense adjusted to reflect non-GAAP adjustments; and (v) the following discrete items:

Acquisition and integration costs – Represents costs related to the acquisition and integration of the IS&GS Business. 
Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Represents the amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets. 
Restructuring expenses – Represents costs associated with lease termination and severance costs (including those related to the Company's acquisition of the IS&GS Business and the September 2013 spin-off of its former technical services). 
Amortization of equity method investments - Represents the amortization on the difference between the book value and fair value of equity method investments that were recorded in connection with the acquisition of the IS&GS Business. 
Gains and losses on disposal of assets and businesses – Represents the gains or losses on certain sales of real estate and businesses. 
Asset impairment charges – Represents impairments of long-lived intangible and tangible assets.

Non-GAAP operating margin is computed by dividing non-GAAP operating income by revenue.
Adjusted EBITDA is computed by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations, before income taxes: (i) discrete items as identified above; (ii) interest expense; (iii) interest income; and (iv) depreciation expense.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is computed by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue.
