Intertrust N.V. acquires Elian Group
Intertrust N.V. acquires Elian GroupIntertrust N.V. acquires Elian GroupSpecialist in Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate Fund AdministrationAmsterdam - June 6, 2016 - Intertrust N.V. ("Intertrust" or "Company") [ticker symbol INTER] a leading global provider of high-value trust and corporate services, announces it has signed an agreement to acquire Elian Group ("Elian", the "Company") from Elian's management and funds managed by Electra Partners LLP ("Electra").Elian is a high growth, regional Trust & Corporate Services leader with an excellent management team and 615[1] dedicated, highly qualified employees. The Company has the number one leadership position in Jersey and a strong presence in the UK and 13 other jurisdictions, 10 of which overlap with Intertrust. Elian is particularly strong in services for Capital Markets, having acquired SFM in 2015, and for Private Equity & Real Estate Fund Administration, serving a similar blue chip client base comprising alternative investment funds, financial institutions, corporate and private clients. Elian has stringent compliance and KYC standards, comparable to Intertrust's. For FYE January 2017, Elian is expected to generate Revenue of £96 million and EBITDA of £36 million (37.4% margin), representing a CAGR of 9% and 12%, respectively, on Revenue and EBITDA since FYE January 2015 (pro forma for the acquisitions of Allied Trust and SFM, including FX).The transaction has a strong strategic rationale, supported by attractive financial metrics and an excellent cultural fit, with approximately 40 of Elian's management team and key employees re-investing £26 million of proceeds into Intertrust shares. The acquisition of Elian reinforces Intertrust's global leadership position, increases diversification across jurisdictions and clients, and aligns perfectly with Intertrust's three strategic M&A pillars:Significantly increases Intertrust's scale in the UK (London), Ireland and Spain, and further consolidates Intertrust's market leading positions in Cayman, Guernsey, Luxembourg and the Netherlands;Adds high-value complementary services for Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate Fund Administration; andExpands Intertrust's footprint with the number one leadership position in the attractive jurisdiction of Jersey.The total consideration to be paid for the acquisition is £435 million (557 million), implying an EV/EBITDA CY 2016E[2] of 9.5x taking into account identified run-rate synergies of £10.4 million[3]. Pre-synergies, EV/EBITDA CY 2016E2 is 12.3x, in line with recent sector transactions. Synergies will come from a reduction in overlapping support functions; savings on insurance policies, regulatory costs and professional services; rationalization of duplicate locations and cross-selling across client networks.The transaction is expected to yield approximately 10% accretion on a pro forma basis excluding synergies to CY 2016E adjusted net income per share[4] guidance of minimum 1.30, approximately 20% accretion to adjusted net income per share by CY 2018E including synergies[5] and a double-digit ROIC by CY 2018E including synergies.The acquisition will be funded through 100 million in cash, 315[6] million in debt and 155 million in equity. £26 million[7] (33 million) of the consideration will be re-invested by management and key employees. Closing of the transaction is expected by Q3 / Q4 2016 and is conditional upon shareholder approval in an Extraordinary General Meeting approval and customary regulatory approvals. The Board of Intertrust has approved the transaction and a majority of Intertrust's shareholders have provided undertakings to vote in favour of the transaction. At closing of the transaction, Intertrust expects pro forma leverage to be up to a maximum of 4.0x LTM net debt/EBITDA (including run-rate synergies in compliance with covenant) and to decrease to the medium term target range of 2.0 - 2.5x net debt/EBITDA by CY 2018E absent further M&A.Commenting on the transaction, David de Buck, CEO of Intertrust said "The acquisition of Elian presents a great opportunity for Intertrust to significantly expand its Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate Fund Administration services. Consolidation in our industry continues, and the ability of global trust and corporate services providers to acquire high quality companies will determine their success going forward. Against this backdrop, I am especially pleased to announce the addition of Elian to the Intertrust family. Our similar cultures and the emphasis both our companies place on integrity and high-value service delivery will form a strong basis for successful integration. The inclusion of Elian's capabilities and geographic presence will consolidate Intertrust's position in Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate Fund Administration, add scale to our operations in several important jurisdictions, and bring us the leadership position in Jersey. With Elian on board, we will be able to offer more to our clients and investors worldwide. I look forward to working with Elian's excellent team."Commenting on the transaction, Paul Willing, CEO of Elian said "Our combined service offering and network of offices globally will broaden and strengthen our capabilities to support our clients in all key international business locations. We know Intertrust shares our belief that our people are our most valuable asset. The opportunities for career development, as well as the leadership and international mobility programs will make our tie-up with Intertrust especially interesting for our employees. We are truly creating the global leader in our industry with this transaction - very exciting." In connection with the acquisition of Elian, Intertrust is updating its outlook and medium term objectives:Approximately 10% accretion on a pro forma basis excluding synergies to CY 2016E adjusted net income per share guidance of minimum 1.30 and approximately 20% accretion to adjusted net income per share by CY 2018E5 including synergies;Guidance reiterated of an adjusted net income per share of minimum 1.30 for Intertrust stand-alone in CY 2016E before the impact of the acquisition; this takes into account the expectation that Q2 2016 organic growth will be below Q1's, with a solid recovery in Q3 and Q4;For the medium term, objective reiterated of organic revenue growth slightly above market growth of 5%[8];Adjusted EBITA margin improvement objective increased by 100bps to 300 - 350bps by CY 2018E over the Intertrust stand-alone CY 2015 pro forma adjusted EBITA margin of 40.4%[9];Cash conversion to continue to be in line with historical rates;Effective tax rate lowered to approximately 16%;Dividend payout in the range of 40% to 50% of adjusted net income including for CY 2016E the expected positive contribution of Elian post closing; andLeverage of 2.0 - 2.5x net debt/EBITDA by CY 2018E absent further M&A.The following parties have advised Intertrust on the transaction: Deutsche Bank acted as financial adviser and Simmons & Simmons and Stibbe have acted as legal counsel. Deutsche Bank and HSBC have provided committed debt financing in support of the transaction. Deutsche Bank has been appointed as Sole Bookrunner for the placement of newly issued shares for Intertrust.

Intertrust N.V. announces preliminary Q2 2017 financial informationAmsterdam - 25 July 2017 - Intertrust N.V. ("Intertrust" or the "Company") [ticker symbol INTER], a leading global provider of high-value trust, corporate and fund services, today announces preliminary financial information for the second quarter ended 30 June 2017.Intertrust expects to report the following Q2 2017 results on 24 August 2017:Revenue of EUR 118.1 million for Q2 2017, an underlying1 change of -0.1% year-on-year, impacted by negative revenue growth in the Netherlands;Adjusted EBITA margin of 35.3% for Q2 2017, impacted mainly by non-recurring items of EUR 2.1 million (approx. 180 bps impact), primarily related to a legal claim and related legal fees.For the full year 2017, we revise underlying1 revenue growth guidance to at least 3.5% year-on-year. The adjusted EBITA margin guidance of approximately 39.9% for the full year 2017 is lowered to 37.5-38.5%, reflecting the following key items:Non-recurring items during the first half of 2017 (six months ended 30 June 2017) of EUR 2.9 million (approx. 60 bps impact on a full year basis);Higher Group HQ and IT costs, mainly due to required additional IT expenses; andLower than expected revenue performance in the Netherlands, resulting from lower productivity due to higher staff turnover and less favourable market conditions.Further analysis of our IT platform and current running IT programmes revealed that additional investments are required and management is implementing the necessary changes in IT. Intertrust Netherlands' performance was below expectations and management is taking decisive actions that, along with recent management changes in the Netherlands, are expected to lead to improved operational performance. Synergies related to the Elian acquisition remain on track, the ex-Elian/Jersey business is performing in line with expectations, and we continue to see good operating leverage in the business.Full Q2 and half year 2017 results will be published on 24 August 2017. 1 Underlying: at constant currency and 2016 including proforma Elian and Azcona figuresAnalyst conference call:Intertrust CEO David de Buck and CFO Maarten de Vries will hold a conference call at 08:00 CET today.

      Amsterdam - 25 July 2017 - Intertrust N.V. ("Intertrust" or
      the "Company") [ticker symbol INTER], a leading global
      provider of high-value trust, corporate and fund services,
      today announces preliminary financial information for the
      second quarter ended 30 June 2017.
    

      Intertrust expects to report the following Q2 2017 results on
      24 August 2017:
    



          Revenue of EUR 118.1 million for Q2 2017, an
          underlying1
          change of -0.1% year-on-year, impacted by negative
          revenue growth in the Netherlands;
        



          Adjusted EBITA margin of 35.3% for Q2 2017, impacted
          mainly by non-recurring items of EUR 2.1 million (approx.
          180 bps impact), primarily related to a legal claim and
          related legal fees.
        



      For the full year 2017, we revise underlying1 revenue
      growth guidance to at least 3.5% year-on-year.
      The adjusted EBITA margin guidance of approximately 39.9% for
      the full year 2017 is lowered to 37.5-38.5%, reflecting the
      following key items:
    



          Non-recurring items during the first half of 2017 (six
          months ended 30 June 2017) of EUR 2.9 million (approx. 60
          bps impact on a full year basis);
        



          Higher Group HQ and IT costs, mainly due to required
          additional IT expenses; and
        



          Lower than expected revenue performance in the
          Netherlands, resulting from lower productivity due to
          higher staff turnover and less favourable market
          conditions.
        



      Further analysis of our IT platform and current running IT
      programmes revealed that additional investments are required
      and management is implementing the necessary changes in
      IT.
      Intertrust Netherlands' performance was below expectations
      and management is taking decisive actions that, along with
      recent management changes in the Netherlands, are expected to
      lead to improved operational performance.
    

      Synergies related to the Elian acquisition remain on track,
      the ex-Elian/Jersey business is performing in line with
      expectations, and we continue to see good operating leverage
      in the business.
    

      Full Q2 and half year 2017 results will be published on 24
      August 2017.

The acquisition is part of an ongoing theme of industry consolidation in this sector. The transaction required input from all of our specialist departments and from our network of international offices outside London together with local law firms. It was a team effort in a tight time frame and demonstrated our strength and depth in M&A for regulated clients in regulated markets within the Global Asset Management sector. We look forward to continue developing our relationship with our client".
Corporate partner based in Amsterdam, Leo Verhoeff, added: "We take pride in Arthur and his team having counselled Intertrust on this major transaction. We have been advising Intertrust on significant cases ever since 2009 when it became independent. We have advised CEO David de Buck and CFO Ernesto Traulsen and the management team all along on their path of transformation, growth under the umbrella of private equity and since recent becoming listed. It feels good this experience continues and we trust that is mutual."
