VASCO Data Security International, Inc. is a publicly-traded cybersecurity technology company based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. The company is known for its two-factor authentication and electronic signature software, which manages digital assets and online transactions for financial institutions. It was founded by T. Kendall Hunt in 1991 and held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2000. Vasco is a member of the FIDO Alliance Board.[2][3]
History[edit]
In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded VASCO Corp. as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. The company acquired ThumbScan Inc., which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer,[4] in 1991. It was renamed VASCO Data Security International, Inc. by 1993 and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.[5]
Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. Forbes recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.[6][7][8]
The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.[9][10][11][12]
In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, Inc., a Canadian document e-signature company, for $113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentification feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.[13][14][15][16][17][18]
