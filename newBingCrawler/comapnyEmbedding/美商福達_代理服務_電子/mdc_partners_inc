Topics include immunotherapy discovery, development, biomarkers, and translational oncology as well as emerging topic areas such as cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and advances in synthetic biology techniques.

Curious about what to expect at ASCO 2017? ta-Scan has you covered!
Written by Mieke Melis on June 1, 2017. Posted in News
As ASCO 2017 kicks off this Friday, finding the information relevant to you can be a hassle. Using ta-Scan, you can quickly uncover key information about sponsors, clinical trials, drugs and investigators contributing to ASCO this year. To help you out, we highlight a few interesting points.

Abstracts
Over the past 3 years, there have been some notable changes in therapeutic areas discussed at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting. It comes as no surprise that the Immune Oncology trend is growing year on year, much like Lung Cancer. On the other hand, interest in Breast Cancer is steadily declining, which could be due to the disappointing results of Immune Oncology within Breast Cancer. Another interesting fact is the gain in Gastrointestinal Cancer abstracts at this year’s conference, after a relatively quiet 2016.

Sponsor & trial activity
Of the 1,203 clinical trials that are cited at ASCO 2017, 6 key commercial sponsors have seen considerable fluctuations in trial activity when compared to ASCO 2016. Significant gains can be seen in the trial activity of BMS, Pfizer, and Roche, whereas Novartis, Sanofi, and Johnson & Johnson have seen a decrease in trial numbers.

ta-Scan’s top 5 drugs to watch at ASCO 2017
With preliminary results already disclosed for some drugs debuting at ASCO, ta-Scan highlights some new drugs being discussed in the Immune Oncology space. Introduction of two Antibody drug conjugates for Prostate and Breast Cancer, the Colony Stimulating Factor-1 receptor Cabiralizumab and CD122 compounds from Nektar that facilitate immune response against tumors. In addition to anti-PD-L1 compound Incyte have a promising combination with Pembrolizumab and an indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase inhibitor, Epacadostat.

Investigator & sponsor collaborations
Looking at the percentage of top Oncology experts used by the leading commercial sponsors of trials talked about at ASCO 2017, it’s clear that Roche and Merck have an evenly distributed usage of investigators in both the USA as well as Europe, whereas others seem to lean toward USA investigator preference.

MDC Partners Stock Sees Short Interest Drop 29%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, which shows a 2,083,986 share decrease in total short interest for MDC Partners Inc , to 5,102,626, a decrease of 29.00% since 10/31/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

First Week of June 2017 Options Trading For MDC Partners (MDCA)
Investors in MDC Partners Inc saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2017 expiration.

Why is MDC Partners different from other ad holding companies?
MDC Partners is more than a marketing organization. We are a Business Transformation Organization that utilizes technology, marketing communications, data analytics and strategic consulting solutions to drive meaningful returns on Marketing and Communications Investments for clients around the world.
We have long held a distinct view of the industry, and have benefitted from our entrepreneurial culture. Our reputation as “The Place Where Great Talent Lives,” is rooted in our durable competitive advantage of empowering the most talented entrepreneurial thought leaders to drive business success to new levels of achievement, for our clients and our shareholders – that prefers the perspective of the insurgent.
This commitment to great talent comes to life in the structural organization of MDC because we believe that these influential, innovative people – the type of people that create the most value for organizations – thrive in an atypical environment.  Accordingly, MDC generally establishes perpetual partnership with agency partners by initially acquiring 51-75% of firms, and putting in place equity-linked ownership mechanisms for the next-generation management team, thereby leaving a significant equity stake in the hands of the operating leadership.  In addition, at the corporate level, we enlist world-class executives with specialized expertise to support the ambitions and unique needs of our partners and clients.
MDC’s cultural and structural difference has enabled us to successfully create a billion dollar revenue platform with an infrastructure built for growth, extraordinary thought leadership talent across our partner companies, a global perspective, and cutting edge marketing solutions that are social, analytically based, insight-driven and most importantly, drive significant financial results for our clients.  Organic growth has long served as one of the strongest indicators that we are successfully partnering with clients to drive financial and operational results for them, and we are proud that our organic growth has far outpaced and outperformed that of the industry over the last seven years.

What value does MDC bring to the agencies in its network?
MDC Partners’ main focus is to provide our partner firms whatever resources they need to best service their respective clients and grow. We do this by not only leveraging best practices and our capital, but also by enlisting world-class practice-area experts as part of our Strategic Resources Group.  This group of executives actively works with our partner firms in areas such as new business development and cross-pollination of client relationships, overall strategy, digital strategy, analytics, talent development, retention and recruitment, procurement, operational best practices and public relations.

How many agencies are in the network?
MDC Partners is a global network of over 50 agency brands.

What is MDC's client concentration?
Our top top 10 clients are 22.0% of Q1 2017 revenue.

In what industries does MDC have the most client exposure?
As referenced in our first quarter management presentation see revenue by client sector below:


What are MDC’s plans for expansion internationally?
While MDC has historically largely been focused on North America, the largest market for our services in the world, our global footprint is becoming increasingly important as clients are looking to us to help them grow their businesses in new markets. Over the last several years, in fact, we have invested in multiple new overseas offices in order to leverage existing relationships with global clients. We now have over 20 offices in markets such as the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and more recently, India, which positions us well to increasingly win international and global assignments. Over 10% of MDC Partners’ revenues were generated outside of North America in 2016. Over time, based on client demand, we expect our overseas presence to increase as a percent of the total business.
