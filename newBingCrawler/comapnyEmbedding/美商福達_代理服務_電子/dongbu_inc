Company Overview



						Dongbu Lightec in 1989, beginning with CNC(Computerized Numerical Control) processor business, we developed PCNC(Personal Computer based Numerical Control) system and lead CNC equipment market. Based upon CNC technology, we developed high quality, high capacity LGP(Light Guide Plate) production CNC equipment as well as LGP processing technology which we acquired patents from 21 countries worldwide. Starting with LED light panel business for advertisement (“LumiSheet”) using LGP, we entered into the high-tech LED lighting market. 

						Through success of “LumiSheet” business, we acquired LED lighting technology and launched LED lighting brand called, ‘LumiDas’ in 2007 which we were the first in the Korean market to provide LED lighting business. From consumer bulbs to high value added Highbay and high-tech explosion proof lamp, we set up the long life, high efficient LED lighting line up to replace traditional lighting. Continuous expansion of LED lighting business mainly in Korea, Japan, USA, EU and towards new markets, we are developing as global LED lighting company specializing in industrial business segment.
				




With New Value Creation products, we are committed to pursue Customer Satisfaction through Precision Management and Quality Management. Based on the four core values, we will march forward as the company creates the future light that cares the nature, the globalization as well as the health of humanity.

Dongbu Lightec’s Vision

   “ Global Top 10 Company Specializes in LED Lighting ”
  “ No. 1 Domestic Company Specializes in IT parts Processors ”


Main Business Segments of Dongbu Lightec
LED Lighting Business

				Dongbu Lightec, as the first company in Korea to start LED lighting business with its own brand called, “LumiDas”, we currently provide various commercial to industrial line up suitable for worldwide market.
 				
				Main product line is industrial LED lighting which is excellent in saving energy and cost so we expect high growth in the worldwide market. The on-demand industrial LED lighting products are high efficient Highbay (Bell Type/Linear Type) and high-tech Explosion Proof Lamp (Hazardous Location Fixture).
 								 
				Dongbu Lightec’s LumiDas Explosion Proof Lamp (Hazardous Location Fixture), we received recognition of our advanced quality & design technique by acquiring IECEx(International Electrotechnical Commission system for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Explosive Atmospheres) in 2009, TIIS(Technology Institution of Industrial Safety) from Japan, and UL Hazardous Location Fixture certification from global standard market, USA. We expect rapid growth mainly in Korea, Japan, USA and EU market which we are planning to market our Explosion Proof Lamp (Hazardous Location Fixture) as our strategic product.   
	 						 
				Further, to be prepared against explosive growth expected IoT(Internet of Things) based future convergence market, Dongbu Lightec is planning to supply high-tech IoT sensor embedded LED lighting to the advanced market to become a leading global LED lighting company.
			

Industrial LED Lighting  :  Highbay, Hazardous Location Fixture, Parking, Canopy, Street Light
Commercial LED Lighting  :  Flat Panel, Tube, Multi-Purpose Light, Base Light, Downlight, PAR, Bulb

LED Light Panel Business for Advertisement

				Patented in 21 countries worldwide, V-cut processing technology applied LumiSheet Business has supply chain in 60 countries, over 150 accounts for outdoor advertisement panels, malls & stores advertisement panels, and shop-fitting business like merchandise display stands, showcases, etc. LumiSheet is high profit/high value-added which creates steady business in the North America/ Japan through successful localization of Joint Venture companies. Dongbu Lightec will lead the global LED advertisement lighting business through continuous development of leading technology.
			
CNC Processor Business

				In possession of own developed controller, competitive CNC processor business brings $2M per annum of steady sales and high profits and holds No.1 domestic market share in the smart phone metal case processor business. Also, Smart phone having short replacement period due to explosive demand from the market, CNC processor become the beneficiary product. In the near future, large LED/OLED TV frame will require more of the 3D processing technology; we expect the use of CNC processors will increase.

ULPC (Ultra Low Phosphorus Carbon)



													                                  	ULPC with an extremely small amount of phosphorus and carbon is high-purity ferro manganese (FeMn) and a substitute for manganese. It is an indispensable subsidiary material for lighter and stronger steel products. Demand for ULPC is expected to rise steadily in the future considering the environmental regulations and the resulting of shortage in the supply of manganese and increases in the final price. A proprietary invention of Dongbu Metal, ULPC is a world-class high value product scheduled for full-scale commercialization starting in 2011.■ Applications: Ultra-light automotive steel sheets, vibration damping steel sheets, etc.■ Specification: Mn 90%; Si 1.5%; C 0.1% ↓; P 0.05%↓; S 0.02%↓
													                                    










 





 




 




LC SiMn (Low Carbon Silicomanganese)



													                                  	LC SiMn acts as a deoxidizer during steelmaking and is used to produce stainless steel and welding rod. Invented by Dongbu Metal, the metal is available commercially.■ Applications: Stainless steel, welding rod■ Specification: Mn 55 - 60%; Si 25 - 35%; C 0.5%↓; P 0.5%↓; S 0.01%↓
													                                    










 





 




 




LN MC/LC FeMn (Low Nitrogen Medium/Low Carbon Ferro Manganese)



													                                  	LN MC/LC FeMn (MC or LC FeMn with reduced nitrogen content) is a high value product developed independently by Dongbu Metal. It is scheduled for commercialization starting in 2011. Demand for LN MC FeMn is expected to rise in the future as steelmakers try to reduce mechanical flaws during the manufacturing process of high-end steels such as high alloy steel.
													                                    










 





 




 




LB SiMn (Low Boron Silicomanganese)



													                                  	LB SiMn (SiMn with lowered boron content) is Dongbu Metal’s specialized product that is scheduled for commercial release in 2011. Boron as one of the impurities that compromise the weldability of steel and contribute to crack development, and demand for LB SiMn is on the rise among steelmakers.
													                                    










 





 




 




SiMn (Silicomanganese)



													                                  	During the manufacturing process, impurities such as oxygen and sulfur are eliminated to improve overall steel purity. SiMn is added to ensure refining and deoxidation of steel. It is low-grade steel that is used mostly to produce shape steels, rebars and other low-grade products by electric arc furnace steelmakers. Dongbu Metal is the largest local supplier of SiMn.■ Applications: Generic low-grade steels such as shape steels and steel reinforcement■ Specification: Mn 65 - 70%; Si 20 - 25%; C 1.5%↓; P 0.30%↓; S 0.02%↓
													                                    










 





 




 




MC/LC FeMn (Medium/Low Carbon Ferro Manganese)



													                                  	During the manufacturing process, impurities such as oxygen and sulfur are eliminated to improve steel purity and manganese is added to enhance the properties of steel. Carbon is also added as an alloying element. LC FeMn, with less than 0.5wt% of carbon, is a high value product used by POSCO and other iron/steel makers around the world to produce high-end automotive steel plates and other high-quality steel products. Dongbu Metal is the sole proprietor of LC FeMn and MC FeMn manufacturing technology in Korea and a No. 2 supplier in the global market.■ Applications: High-end automotive steel sheets■ Specification: MC Mn 80 - 85%; Si 1.5%↓; C 1.5%↓; P 0.20%↓; S 0.02%↓               LC Mn 80 - 85%; Si 1.5%↓; C 0.8%↓; P 0.20%↓; S 0.02%↓
													                                    










 





 




 




HC FeMn (High Carbon Ferro Manganese)



													                                  	During the manufacturing process, impurities such as oxygen and sulfur are eliminated to improve steel purity. Also, manganese is added to enhance the properties of steel. Carbon is also added as an alloying element.
