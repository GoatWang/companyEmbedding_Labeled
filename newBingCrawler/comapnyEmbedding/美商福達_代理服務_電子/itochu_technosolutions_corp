ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation (Satoshi Kikuchi, President & CEO; headquartered in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo), Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Tsuneo Murata, President and Representative Director; headquartered in Nagaokakyo-shi, Kyoto; hereinafter “Murata Manufacturing”), and NTT DATA INTELLILINK Corporation (Kou Miyake, President and CEO; headquartered in Chuo-ku, Tokyo; hereinafter “NTT DATA INTELLILINK”) will jointly develop a dedicated rack system that is compliant with the specifications of the Open Compute Project (hereinafter “the OCP”), a project that promotes open specifications for facilities such as data centers as well as hardware. Murata Manufacturing will be responsible for the design and manufacture of the power unit, incorporating the technology of the centralized power system owned by NTT DATA INTELLILINK. ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation will incorporate customer needs in Japan, for developing the specifications of the dedicated rack system. The rack will be produced by multiple rack manufacturers of Japan.

Reasons why the OCP dedicated rack system is required
OCP is a project started by Facebook, Inc. in 2011 to design the best hardware for large-scale data centers. More than 150 companies participating in the project worldwide are moving forward to design the specification for datacenter in the hyper-scale environment. Since, the OCP dedicated rack system is designed with Unites States Standard, it becomes too large in size (height, depth) and has supported the 3-phase power input compare to the conventional single-phase power mainly supported in Japan. This makes the OCP Standard rack costing more than the traditional 19-inch rack. In order to use OCP-compliant hardware in Japanese datacenters, the power source, rack size, and cost issues have to be solved, and an earthquake-resistant design needs to be implemented.

ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation’s role in developing the OCP dedicated rack system
ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation concluded the Solution Provider Agreement with the Open Compute Project Foundation in January 2011 and became the first Solution Provider in Japan. ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation provides hardware sales, system integration, maintenance support, and operational support services. Since 2015, it has also been providing the Open Cloud Package, a solution for next-generation IT infrastructure using OCP certified hardware and multiple Open Source Software (OSS) including OpenStack. In developing the dedicated rack system compatible with the OCP, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation has designed the rack system to meet the needs of Japanese datacenters, based on the experience it has gained through the proposals and deliveries to the customers. In addition to the OCP compliant hardware sales, system integration, maintenance support, and operational support services, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation will offer OCP dedicated rack system integrated with server, storage, and network as a total solution.


Murata Manufacturing’s role in developing the OCP dedicated rack system
Murata Manufacturing have been engaged in the development, production, and distribution of centralized power supplies for data centers that are mounted in 19-inch standard racks and also working on developing high-powered lithium ion batteries. Murata Manufacturing also joined the OCP, which has attracted a great deal of interest throughout the industry in recent years, and has been working on the possibilities of supporting this project. By combining the Murata Manufacturing’s accumulated knowledge regarding the centralized power source technology, lithium-ion battery related technology with ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation and NTT DATA INTELLILINK’s solution, Murata Manufacturing is working to develop the power shelves that include highly efficient and high quality power supplies and lithium-ion batteries. The company will help to reduce the cost of datacenter operation by providing highly efficient and highly reliable OCP compatible power shelves, using the centralized power source system with highly efficient and high quality power supplies as well as lithium-ion batteries made in house.


NTT DATA INTELLILINK’s role in developing the OCP dedicated rack system
NTT DATA INTELLILINK delivers the centralized power system solution to cut down the power consumption of server rack systems. This solution offers a very efficient power source mythology by removing power supplies from individual IT devices and centralizing the power supplies in the server rack. By doing so, this improves 5 to 10% power efficiency for each server rack. NTT DATA INTELLILINK owns patents*1 for the technologies that optimally control the number of centralized power supplies and also the use of batteries to respond to the peak demand of IT devices. Using these technologies, NTT DATA INTELLILINK will provide the solution that supports both 19-inch rack and OCP dedicated rack. In addition, this solution with high voltage direct current (HVDC) input to the centralized power supplies will provide an excellent energy-saving, highly reliable and safe system compare to the traditional UPS systems.

Features of the OCP dedicated rack system
The OCP dedicated rack system supports OCP certified products. This rack improves power efficiency by performing AC-DC conversion through the centralized power supplies, which supplies DC power to servers, storage devices, and network devices via BusBars. Countries around the world use different power transmission systems and voltages*2. In the United States, OCP standard rack is mostly used with 200V or 480V 3-phase 4-wire system. However, it has been difficult to deploy OCP standard racks in Japan, where a 100V or 200V single-phase system or a 200V 3-phase, 3-wire system is generally used. The OCP dedicated rack system will offer not only 3-phase, 4-wire system, but also the choice from 3-phase 3-wire , single-phase and high voltage direct current (HVDC) system, with high-level of efficiency. This allows deploying the OCP product in traditional Japanese datacenter much easier. The height and depth of the rack system will also be modified to the commonly used size in Japan, while discussions are being held to set the price range at 70% of the OCP standard rack currently being sold. 

Date of release
The sample power supplies and the shelf will release in August 2016 and production model will be in March 2017. The multi-purpose battery module will also release in March 2017 and the other modules will be available also. 
The sample of the OCP dedicated rack system will be exhibited at the OCP U.S. SUMMIT 2016, which will be held on March 9 and 10, 2016 in San Jose, California, United States.

*1: Patent No. 57710900 “Power supply system”
*2: The United States and Europe generally use a 3-phase, 4-wire system in which 3-phase electric power is transmitted via 4 cables. In contrast, there are countries and regions such as Japan and the Philippines that use a 3-phase, 3-wire system in which 3-phase power is provided via 3 cables. In addition, although they use the same system, the United States uses mainly voltages close to 210V, while Europe uses those in the neighborhood of 400V. As these examples show, different systems and voltages are used depending on the country and region.

Itochu Corporation (伊藤忠商事株式会社, Itōchū Shōji Kabushiki-gaisha, known in English as C. Itoh & Co. until 1992) is a Japanese corporation based in Umeda, Kita-ku, Osaka and Aoyama, Minato, Tokyo.
Itochu is the second-largest Japanese sogo shosha (general trading company) after Mitsubishi Corporation. Among Japanese trading companies, it is distinguished by not being descended from an historical zaibatsu group, but by the strength of its textiles business and its successful business operations in China.[1] It has six major operational divisions specializing in textiles, metals/minerals, food, machinery, energy/chemicals and ICT/general products/real estate.[2] Itochu was ranked 174th on 2013's list of Fortune Global 500 companies with an annual trading revenue of 145 billion USD.[3]
Itochu is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu.

History[edit]
Prewar years[edit]
Itochu dates the start of its business to 1858, shortly after the opening of Japan to foreign trade, when Chubei Itoh (伊藤 忠兵衛, Itō Chūbei) began door-to-door wholesaling of linen in the regions between Osaka and Kyushu. Itoh founded the "Benichu" drapery store in the Honmachi district of Osaka in 1872. This site was renamed "Itoh Honten" in 1884 and became the Itoh Thread and Yarn Store in 1893, which was renamed "C. Itoh & Co." in 1914.[4]
Chubei Itoh II took over the company following his father's death in 1903. The company opened an office in Shanghai in the 1890s and started business in Seoul in 1905, but had severe difficulties with these first overseas forays. Itoh travelled to London in 1910 and began direct procurement and financing for the business in the London markets, which considerably improved its margins as it had previously used more expensive intermediaries in Japan.[5]
Itoh's company grew considerably in the wake of World War I, with offices in the United States, India, the Philippines and China, and the firm began to handle machinery, automobiles and metals in addition to its core business of textiles. However, a recession in 1920 left the company deeply in debt, and unlike the major zaibatsu firms of the time, it had no captive bank to finance its business. In 1921, the company split in half, with one half forming what is now known as Marubeni. The company's performance improved in the 1930s, but as World War II began in the latter half of the decade, all trading companies' business became increasingly war-oriented.[5] In 1941, Itoh and Marubeni re-combined to form Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha, which merged with two other companies to form Daiken Co., Ltd. in 1944.[4]
Postwar years[edit]
After World War II, the constituent companies of Daiken were spun off from each other in December 1949 as part of GHQ efforts to dismantle the war-era zaibatsu. Itoh re-listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1950.[4]
Itoh resumed business in the wake of the war by bartering Japanese textiles for foreign grain, and resumed trading in petroleum, aircraft, automobiles and machinery to meet UN forces requirements during the Korean War. After the war, Itoh absorbed many smaller trading operations that could no longer stand on their own. Itoh expanded its overseas mining and petroleum exploration activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s, followed by large-scale overseas industrial projects in the 1980s.[5]
Former Imperial Japanese Army staff officer Ryuzo Sejima joined Itoh in 1958 after spending 11 years in a Siberian prison. Four years later, he was promoted to director and became Itoh's head of corporate planning, implementing a military-style internal reporting system. He went on to serve as president and chairman of the company, having developed a powerful group of followers known as the "Sejima Machine." In 1970, Sejima and his younger protege Minoru Murofushi arranged a joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu, one of the first tie-ups between US and Japanese automakers.[6] In 1972 Itoh became the first Japanese trading company allowed to do business in the People's Republic of China.[4]
Itoh was headquartered near the site of Chubei Itoh's historical headquarters in Osaka until 1967, when it upgraded its Tokyo branch to the status of a co-headquarters.[4] In the 1970s, the company became part of the "Kawasaki Group" within the keiretsu of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (now Mizuho Corporate Bank), eventually displacing Nissho Iwai as the keiretsu's dominant trading company. Itoh's affiliation with the keiretsu was significantly looser than other keiretsu-affiliated trading companies, and many firms within the DKB group did not use Itoh's services at all.[7]
Itoh absorbed Ataka & Co., the ninth largest general trading company in Japan, in 1977. Ataka had recently suffered major losses from an oil development project in the United States and had undergone restructuring at the direction of its main lender, Sumitomo Bank.[8]
From the early 1970s Itoh was a major supplier of synthetic yarn (polyester) to India's Reliance Industries Limited.[9] Over the years, the close collaboration between both companies culminated in the co-promotion of a world-scale Polypropylene Project with a capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum at a total project cost of Rs. 525 Crores, at Hazira in the State of Gujarat. With a $50 million for a 15 percent stake,[9] it was at that point, the largest investment in India by a Japanese firm.[10] Itoh also marketed products—under their own label—as diverse as a line of bicycles (mostly manufactured by Bridgestone), and computer printers. Itochu began to develop a strong information technology business in the 1980s through its subsidiary C. Itoh Techno-Science (CTC), which acted as a Japan distributor for Sun Microsystems, Cisco, Oracle and others.[6]
On October 1, 1992, C. Itoh & Co. Ltd. changed its English name to Itochu Corporation, a more direct transliteration of its Japanese name.[10] By the early 1990s Itochu had become the largest trading company in Japan, but losses from the Japanese asset price bubble, particularly domestic real estate investments, brought it down to third place by the middle of the decade.[5] In the 1990s Itochu made several investments in the media industry, including a minority stake in Time Warner and investments in cable and satellite delivery systems.[11]
Uichiro Niwa became president of Itochu in 1998, implementing cuts to unprofitable businesses and cutting back executive perks enjoyed by his predecessor Murofushi.[6] In 1999, Itochu became one of the first Japanese companies to move away from the traditional seniority-based pay scale, adopting a base pay scale based on responsibilities, impact and value of each position as well as a performance-linked bonus system.[12] Itochu also spun off CTC in 1999, only to see CTC quickly achieve a market capitalization more than twice that of its former parent company.[6]
Masahiro Okafuji became president of Itochu in 2010 and announced a strategy to make Itochu the first-ranked sogo shosha in areas other than raw resources, particularly in food products and machinery. Under Okafuji's leadership, Itochu implemented a general ban on work after 8 PM with an across-the-board "lights out" policy at 10 PM while encouraging that any necessary overtime be taken in the early morning hours, reducing the total amount of overtime across the company.[13] Itochu moved its Osaka headquarters to the North Gate Building adjacent to Osaka Station in 2011.[14]
Itochu entered into a cross-shareholding relationship with the Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand (CP) in 2014, and together with CP, agreed to invest over $8 billion in the Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Limited during 2015, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[15] The transaction was also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[16]
In July 2016, short seller Glaucus Research Group published a report critical of Itochu's accounting practices, causing a stock price dip of around 10%.[17]
Offices[edit]
ITOCHU's Osaka headquarters is located at the North Gate Building, 1-3, Umeda 3-Chome, Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan Its Tokyo headquarters is located at 5-1 Kita-Aoyama 2-Chome, Minato, Tokyo, Japan.
ITOCHU also has seven branch offices in Japan,[18] sixteen offices and local subsidiaries in China,[19] 24 in Asia,[20] eight in the CIS,[21] four in Australia,[22] fifteen in the Middle East,[23] eight in Africa,[24] twelve in Europe,[25] ten in North America[26] and nine in Latin America.[27]

Itochu Techno-Solutions Co., Ltd. (伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社, Itōchū Tekuno-soryūshonzu Kabushiki-gaisha, abbreviated CTC) is a Japanese systems integrator based in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo. It is a publicly traded subsidiary of Itochu Corporation.
CTC is a Japanese partner of numerous multinational IT vendors including Avaya, IBM, Cisco Systems, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Microsoft, NetApp, Oracle, Symantec and VMware.[1] The company has offices throughout Japan as well as in the United States, Singapore and Malaysia[2].
The company abbreviation CTC is derived from the company philosophy, "Challenging Tomorrow's Changes". Then the company is called CTC, especially among computer business in Japan [3].
History[edit]
Itochu (then known as C. Itoh & Co.) set up CTC's predecessor Itochu Data Systems in the early 1970s to sell American computer equipment in Japan. Itochu middle manager Nobuo Hiroi was tapped to head the company and hired a number of outside employees such as Hiro Satake, a former Japan salesman for NCR. He also introduced a merit pay system, which was rare in Japan at the time. In 1983, CTC became a distributor for Sun Microsystems and helped to pioneer workstation-based computing in Japan. Satake became president in 1994 and inked sales relationships with Cisco Systems and Oracle.[4]
In the late 1990s, as Itochu reeled from losses from the Japanese asset price bubble, Itochu president Uichiro Niwa decided to float CTC on the stock market. CTC had its initial public offering in December 1999, and its market capitalization immediately exceeded that of its parent company Itochu; one year later CTC was valued at around $20 billion while Itochu was valued at only $8 billion.[4]
