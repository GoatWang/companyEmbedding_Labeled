CMC (China
                    Motor Corporation) was founded
                    in June of 1969 and signed a
                    technical collaboration with
                    Mitsubishi Motors Corporation
                    the following year. The Yang-Mei
                    plant was completed at the end
                    of 1973, establishing the manufacturing
                    base for CMC's future growth.
                    The company has been listed on
                    Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) since
                    March 1991.
Beginning with producing commercial
                      vehicles, CMC is the leader of
                      Taiwan's commercial vehicles
                      manufacturers. While the company's
                      Yang-Mei plant produced less
                      than 300 vehicles per month through
                      1975, by the year 1983, total
                      output had surpassed the 100,000
                      unit mark. This was, in part,
                      made possible by our most advanced
                      painting facility in Taiwan.
                      This was as well a prelude to
                      the rapid growth that accompanied
                      Taiwan's emergence as an industrial
                      and economic power.
Since 1987, CMC's revenues began
                      an extended run of double-digit
                      growth, gaining accolades as
                      one of Taiwan's best-managed
                      companies. 
In 1993, the company garnered
                      both ISO 9002 certification and
                      the National Quality Award of
                      Taiwan. In 1997, the company
                      also obtained ISO 14001 Environmental
                      Management certification.
The company has invested in
                      China's South East Motor Corporation
                      (SEM) since 1995. Our investment
                      in China gives us access to one
                      of the world's fastest-growing
                      economies, while increased production
                      capacity enables us to develop
                      new models and penetrate foreign
                      markets.
CMC is adept at taking advantage
                      of market opportunities, and
                      promoting fiscal transparency
                      along with a merit-based personnel
                      system that has molded its employees
                      into a cohesive unit. Meanwhile,
                      a cooperative, win-win purchasing
                      system involving the enterprise
                      and its suppliers, has enhanced
                      flexibility and improved quality.
                      Thorough implementation of strategic
                      policy has allowed the company
                      to accurately access markets,
                      and manufacture the right vehicle,
                      at the right time.

Enterprise
                Operations


 




CMC's business operations are
                    guided by the principles expressed
                    in the acronym HIT, which stands
                    for Harmony, Innovation, and Top. 

Harmony
                    True harmony allows the amicable resolution
                    of problems and issues in a spirit of cooperation,
                    creating a win-win situation. This is much
                    like the interplay of instruments in any
                    fine symphony orchestra. CMC's management
                    strives to conduct its affairs to the benefit
                    of all its constituencies: customers, employees,
                    the government, society, shareowners, and
                    suppliers. This creates a harmonious environment
                    that offers mutual rewards. 

Innovation
                    Innovation is the active process of invention,
                    discovery, and improvement. It can also viewed
                    as a continuous process of renewal providing
                    a vision and wisdom that transcends transient
                    condition. CMC is forever striving to enhance
                    its existing competitive advantage through
                    conceptual innovation in its product, technology,
                    manufacturing process, management, and services.

Top
                    Top is the litmus test for quality, much
                    like the athlete who sets his sights on the
                    ultimate goal. CMC expects Top performance
                    in all phases of enterprise operations, strategic
                    planning implementation, and long-term vision.
                    Overall, the top concept benefits Taiwan's
                    whole society.

CMC Limited was an information technology services, consulting and software company having its headquarters in New Delhi, India.[1][4] CMC is part of the TATA Group and is owned by Tata Consultancy Services. CMC was incorporated on 26 December 1975, as the 'Computer Management Corporation Private Limited'.[5] The Government of India held 100 per cent of the equity share capital and owned by government of India. On 19 August 1977, it was converted into a public limited company. In October 2001, CMC was privatized by the Government of India,[6] in a sale to India-based Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the largest software services company in Asia. It also features on top ten companies in India.[7]
History[edit]
During the year 1978,India, CMC took over the maintenance of IBM installations at over 800 around India and subsequently,[8] maintenance of computers supplied by other foreign players.
CMC anticipated the market demand for IT system improvements in 1980 and directed its efforts to respond to the government's activities and needs for such services. 'Project Interact' (International Education and Research for Applications of Computer Technology), a United Nations project involving design, development and systems-engineering, computer-based systems applications in the areas of power distribution, railway freight operations management and meteorology transitioned the company from a hardware maintenance company to a broad IT solutions provider.[citation needed]
CMC later expanded its services to systems integration, interfacing, installation, commissioning, software development, as well as education and training. CMC's R&D facility was set up in 1982 at Hyderabad.[9] CMC was renamed CMC Limited (Computer Maintenance Corporation) in August 1984.[citation needed]
CMC Limited has the credit of introducing computer applications at a mass scale in the late 80s with its design and deployment of Indian Railways Reservation System IMPRESS (Integrated Multi-train Passenger Reservation System) in New Delhi on 15 October 1985. It went on to become a huge success eventually deployed all over India serving over half a million transactions every single day and cutting wait times for passengers drastically. CMC also followed it up with the design of ARTS (Advanced Railway Ticketing System) for unreserved ticketing.
Following a spurt in the global demand for IT services in the early 1990s, particularly in the United States, CMC decided to expand its operations and market its product and service offerings in these markets. Towards this end, in 1991, CMC acquired Baton Rouge International Inc, USA (it was subsequently renamed CMC Americas, Inc, in 2003), one of the first cross-border acquisitions by an Indian IT firm.
In 1992, the Indian government divested 16.69 per cent of CMC's equity to the General Insurance Corporation of India and its subsidiaries who, in turn, sold part of their stake to the public in 1996. In 1993, CMC's shares were listed on the Hyderabad Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
To service and develop its clientele in the UK and Europe, CMC opened a branch office in London, in 2000.[10] The next year, the government divested 51 per cent of CMC's equity to Tata Sons Ltd, through a strategic sale, and CMC became a part of the Tata group.
In line with its strategy of offering its products and services globally, in 2003, CMC opened a branch office in Dubai to tap the hitherto unexplored markets of West Asia and Africa.
In 2004, the government divested its remaining 26.5 per cent stake in CMC to the public.[11]
The Board of Directors of CMC decided to merge the Company into its parent company Tata Consultancy Services Limited on 16 - October - 2014. CMC Merged with TCS on 1 October 2015
