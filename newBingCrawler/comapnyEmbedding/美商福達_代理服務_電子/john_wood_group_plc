History[edit]
The business was founded by Sir Ian Wood in 1982, when it split away from JW Holdings,[2] the largest fishing company in Scotland.[3] JW Holdings had diversified into the energy services business at the outset of the North Sea oil industry in the early 1970s.[4] The company acquired Mustang Engineering Inc, an engineering business based in Houston, Texas in September 2000.[5] In 2002, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange.[3]
In March 2015, Wood Group secured a contract worth over NOK500m (£41m) to expand and upgrade the Kollsnes gas processing plant in Norway. The contract was awarded by Statoil on behalf of plant operator Gassco. Under the deal, Wood Group will carry out engineering modifications and upgrades to the facility, located west of Bergen. [6]
In March 2017, the company announced it would acquire its rival, Amec Foster Wheeler, in an all stock deal, valued at approximately £2.2 billion.[7] If the deal is approved, the new company will have a combined workforce of about 64,000 people.[8]
Operations[edit]
Wood Group provides a range of engineering, production support and maintenance management services to the energy and industrial sectors worldwide.[9]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The business was founded by Sir Ian Wood in 1982, when it split away from JW Holdings,[2] the largest fishing company in Scotland.[3] JW Holdings had diversified into the energy services business at the outset of the North Sea oil industry in the early 1970s.[4] The company acquired Mustang Engineering Inc, an engineering business based in Houston, Texas in September 2000.[5] In 2002, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange.[3]
In March 2015, Wood Group secured a contract worth over NOK500m (£41m) to expand and upgrade the Kollsnes gas processing plant in Norway. The contract was awarded by Statoil on behalf of plant operator Gassco. Under the deal, Wood Group will carry out engineering modifications and upgrades to the facility, located west of Bergen. [6]
In March 2017, the company announced it would acquire its rival, Amec Foster Wheeler, in an all stock deal, valued at approximately £2.2 billion.[7] If the deal is approved, the new company will have a combined workforce of about 64,000 people.[8]
Operations[edit]
Wood Group provides a range of engineering, production support and maintenance management services to the energy and industrial sectors worldwide.[9]

In March 2015, Wood Group secured a contract worth over NOK500m (£41m) to expand and upgrade the Kollsnes gas processing plant in Norway. The contract was awarded by Statoil on behalf of plant operator Gassco. Under the deal, Wood Group will carry out engineering modifications and upgrades to the facility, located west of Bergen. [6]
In March 2017, the company announced it would acquire its rival, Amec Foster Wheeler, in an all stock deal, valued at approximately £2.2 billion.[7] If the deal is approved, the new company will have a combined workforce of about 64,000 people.[8]
Operations[edit]
Wood Group provides a range of engineering, production support and maintenance management services to the energy and industrial sectors worldwide.[9]

History[edit]
The business was founded by Sir Ian Wood in 1982, when it split away from JW Holdings,[2] the largest fishing company in Scotland.[3] JW Holdings had diversified into the energy services business at the outset of the North Sea oil industry in the early 1970s.[4] The company acquired Mustang Engineering Inc, an engineering business based in Houston, Texas in September 2000.[5] In 2002, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange.[3]
In March 2015, Wood Group secured a contract worth over NOK500m (£41m) to expand and upgrade the Kollsnes gas processing plant in Norway. The contract was awarded by Statoil on behalf of plant operator Gassco. Under the deal, Wood Group will carry out engineering modifications and upgrades to the facility, located west of Bergen. [6]
In March 2017, the company announced it would acquire its rival, Amec Foster Wheeler, in an all stock deal, valued at approximately £2.2 billion.[7] If the deal is approved, the new company will have a combined workforce of about 64,000 people.[8]
Operations[edit]
Wood Group provides a range of engineering, production support and maintenance management services to the energy and industrial sectors worldwide.[9]

History[edit]
The business was founded by Sir Ian Wood in 1982, when it split away from JW Holdings,[2] the largest fishing company in Scotland.[3] JW Holdings had diversified into the energy services business at the outset of the North Sea oil industry in the early 1970s.[4] The company acquired Mustang Engineering Inc, an engineering business based in Houston, Texas in September 2000.[5] In 2002, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange.[3]
In March 2015, Wood Group secured a contract worth over NOK500m (£41m) to expand and upgrade the Kollsnes gas processing plant in Norway. The contract was awarded by Statoil on behalf of plant operator Gassco. Under the deal, Wood Group will carry out engineering modifications and upgrades to the facility, located west of Bergen. [6]
In March 2017, the company announced it would acquire its rival, Amec Foster Wheeler, in an all stock deal, valued at approximately £2.2 billion.[7] If the deal is approved, the new company will have a combined workforce of about 64,000 people.[8]
Operations[edit]
Wood Group provides a range of engineering, production support and maintenance management services to the energy and industrial sectors worldwide.[9]

        PR Newswire
      

        London, May 23
      



24 May 2017


        Wood Group expands global automation and control
        capabilities with acquisition of CEC Controls Company, Inc.
      

        Wood Group has acquired CEC Controls Company, Inc. (CEC
        Controls), a management-owned designer and builder of
        industrial & process control systems primarily in the
        automotive manufacturing industry, for an initial
        consideration of $44m payable
        in cash at closing with a further total fixed deferred
        consideration of $15m payable
        in cash over the next three years.
      

        Established in 1966, CEC Controls is headquartered near
        Detroit. The company
        employs more than 220 personnel across its 12 North
        American offices and office in Romania. Further deepening Wood
        Group’s automation and control capabilities, this follows
        the acquisition of the Automated Technology Group (ATG),
        one of the UK’s largest independent suppliers of control
        and power solutions for industrial automation, in
        September 2015.
      

        CEC Controls’ current clients include Ford, GM and
        Fiat-Chrysler and the business will continue to be led by
        its existing management team. CEC Controls currently has
        gross assets of $34m and
        generated an EBITA of $9.6m
        in 2016.
      

Robin Watson, Wood Group’s
        chief executive said: “Bringing 50 years of expertise in
        delivering services to the automotive sector, CEC Controls
        significantly complements and strengthens the innovative
        technical solutions we provide to clients within automation
        and control.
      

        “The acquisition supports the geographical broadening of
        our footprint within the automotive sector particularly in
        the US; deepening our presence in the key automotive hub of
        Detroit, where CEC
        Controls is headquartered.
      

        “It also provides us the opportunity to further enhance the
        industrial process & control capabilities we offer to
        this industry and adjacent sectors including aerospace,
        logistics, water, and pharmaceuticals.”
      

        President of CEC Controls, Robert
        Scheper said: “Wood Group’s global footprint and
        breadth of capabilities offers us the opportunity to
        enhance our client solutions and access significant
        international growth opportunities.
      

        “We believe our extensive expertise in the automotive
        manufacturing industry, married with Wood Group’s two
        decades of experience in automation and control, creates a
        powerful solution-driven service offering for clients.”
