Description


 Biodiesel refers to a renewable diesel fuel made from oil crops, animal fats,
 food waste oil that can substitute petroleum diesel and has environmental
 protection, safety, renewability and other advantages.


 During 2006-2013, global biodiesel output grew rapidly from 6.5 billion liters
 in 2006 to 24.6 billion liters in 2013, at a CAGR of 20.9%. There are little
 changes in the global distribution of biodiesel production, mainly
 concentrated in Europe, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and so on. The
 world's ten largest producers contribute to nearly 75% of global production.


 The development of biodiesel started late in China, serving as one of the
 industries vigorously supported by the government. China has released
 Renewable Energy Law and National Standard for Biodiesel (B5) Blend in 2005
 and 2010, respectively. According to ResearchInChina, in 2013, China's total
 capacity of biodiesel exceeded 3.7 million t/a, output attained 1-1.2 million
 t/a, indicating the capacity utilization was not high.


 However, with the implementation of National Standard for Biodiesel (B5) Blend
 and the expansion of application range, it is estimated that China's new
 consumption of biodiesel during 2014-2017 will go beyond 2.5 million tons.
 Following the formal implementation of consumption tax at the biodiesel import
 links on January 1, 2014, coupled with other policies support as well as the
 optimism of enterprises about the biodiesel market, there are still many
 biodiesel projects proposed and under construction in China. As of the end of
 May 2014, major biodiesel projects proposed and under construction have
 boasted a combined capacity of over 2.7 million t/a.






 Listed biodiesel companies include Ningbo Tech-Bank Co., Ltd, Jiangsu Yueda
 Investment Co., Ltd., Xinjiang International Industry Co., Ltd, etc., of
 which, Ningbo Tech-Bank, the controlling shareholder of Hunan Jindeyi Feed Oil
 Co., Ltd (with a capacity of 80 kt/a) saw equity capacity of 70 kt/a in 2013;
 Yueda Investment, the controlling shareholder of Jiangsu Kate New Energy Co.,
 Ltd (with a capacity of 80 kt/a), reached equity capacity of 40 kt/a in 2013;
 Xinjiang International Industry has invested in the construction of a 60 kt/a
 biodiesel project in Xinjiang, and currently, the 30 kt/a phase I is under
 construction.


 China Biodiesel Industry Report, 2014-2017 mainly contains the followings:


Overview, supply and demand, regional policies, etc. of global biodiesel
 market;
 Production and marketing, import and export, price, etc. of Chinese diesel
 market;
 Supply, competition pattern, industry policies, import and export, price,
 projects proposed and under construction of Chinese biodiesel market;
 Operation, biodiesel business, etc. of 6 listed and 37 non-listed
 biodiesel enterprises in China.
