Only the manufacturers and their products listed below are CTI Certified.




revised June 2017

As stated in its opening paragraph, CTI Standard 201... "sets
forth a program whereby the Cooling Technology Institute will
certify that all models of a line of Evaporative Heat Rejection Equipment offered for
sale by a specific Manufacturer will perform thermally in
accordance with the Manufacturer's published ratings..." 


By the purchase of a "certified" model, the Own/Operator has assurance that the
tower will perform as specified. Either that model, or one within its model line, will have been thoroughly tested by 
a CTI-licensed testing agency for Certification and found to perform
as claimed by the Manufacturer.


The following is a directory of cooling tower models currently certified under STD-201.  They are part of product lines offered by 
far-sighted cooling tower companies who are committed to the manufacture and installation of full-performance towers.  In competition with each other, these manufacturers benefit from knowing that they each achieve their published performance capability.  They are therefore, free to distinguish themselves through design excellence and concern for the 
Owner/Operator's operational safety and convenience.
 

Those Manufacturers who have not yet chosen to certify their product lines are invited to do so at the earliest opportunity.  You can 
write to the CTI administrator, Virginia A. Manser, Cooling Technology Institute, PO Box 681807, Houston, Texas  77268 
USA, or e-mail her at vmanser@cti.org for further information.

Profile
CTI Engineering International Co., Ltd. (CTII) was organized around the
      end of the 20th century, as a new affiliate of the CTI group of companies
      (CTI Group), to act in concert with CTI Engineering Co., Ltd. (CTIE), the
      core of the Group, in the accomplishment of the Group’s overseas business.
      With the establishment of CTI Engineering International Co., Ltd., all
      overseas operations of the former Overseas Department of CTIE have been
      transferred to the company, in order to intensify participation and competitiveness
      in the international market. 
      As done under the former Overseas Department, CTII will continue to deal with overseas projects which had expanded to include such fields as flood control, water resources development, highways and bridge engineering, port and coastal engineering, environmental engineering, solid waste management, urban and regional planning, and information technology development. CTII will endeavor to further expand its business overseas, together with the introduction of new, innovative technology and well-disciplined staff, to ultimately cover all fields of consulting services in coordination with its clients in the government and international agencies. 
      To meet the even more sophisticated requirements in these days, CTII is
      committed to provide comprehensive engineering services ranging from research
      on social needs in the pre-investment stage to operation and maintenance
      after construction of a project. Attempts will be made to further cultivate
      capabilities in promising new fields, including value-added engineering,
      which involve innovative technologies under such themes as environmental
      conservation, biotechnology and artificial intelligence.
      The CTI Group maintains a number of branches as well as regional and liaison
      offices in Japan and abroad. Research and technology development is conducted
      at its laboratory facilities for hydraulic model testing and chemical analysis
      to meet specialized project requirements. CTI Engineering International
      Co., Ltd. will continue in close cooperation with its clients to develop
      infrastructure projects, pledging a level of conscientiousness, dedication
      and skill to maintain the reputation as among Japan’s premier consulting
      firms. It stands ready to apply its wide base of experience as the former
      Overseas Department to deliver the ultimate in professional services wherever
      and whenever required.
