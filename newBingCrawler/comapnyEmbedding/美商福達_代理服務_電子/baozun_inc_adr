Financial Analysis
BAOZUN INC -ADR's gross profit margin for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017 has increased when compared to the same period a year ago. The company has grown its sales and net income during the past quarter when compared with the same quarter a year ago, and although its growth in net income has outpaced the industry average, its revenue growth has not. BAOZUN INC -ADR  is extremely liquid. Currently, the Quick Ratio is 2.44 which clearly shows the ability to cover any short-term cash needs. The company managed to increase its liquidity from the same period a year ago, despite already having strong liquidity to begin with. This would indicate improved cash flow. At the same time, stockholders' equity ("net worth") has greatly increased by 25.07% from the same quarter last year. Overall, the key liquidity measurements indicate that the company is very unlikely to face financial difficulties in the near future. STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12-months. To learn more visit www.TheStreetRatings.com.

Chinese E-Commerce Companies Are Gaining On High Volume 

22 Stocks Moving In Thursday's Pre-Market Session 


 

Alibaba-backed Chinese e-commerce company Baozun expects to IPO Thursday, May 21. The company expects to raise $143 million by offering 11 million ADSs priced at $12 to $14 per share on the NASDAQ under the ticker BZUN. 

	At this range, the company’s market value is around $1.8 to $2.1 billion.
China’s Leading E-commerce Solutions Provider

	Founded in Shanghai, 2007, Baozun provides logistics services to help large brands sell products online. After eight years, the company has a 20 percent market share by transaction value, indicated by iReseach Report. Baozun’s services transcend all aspects of the e-commerce chain, covering IT solutions, store operations, digital marketing, customer services, warehousing, and fulfillment.

	The company operates in the fast growing business-to-consumer e-commerce space, allowing online stores to operate with the company’s unique brand image and allows each company to control its own branding and merchandising through official marketplace stores.

	China’s brand e-commerce market is expected to grow from $4 billion in 2010 to $129 billion in 2014, a 145 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). In 2017, these numbers expect to increase to $379 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 43 percent.

Baozun’s brand partners grew from 56 in 2012 to 94 as of March 2015. The brands range from apparel, appliances, electronics, home, food and health, cosmetics and consumer goods, insurance and automobile. Many of its brand partners are market leaders in their industries, like Nike, Microsoft, Haagen Dazs, and Philips.

	China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), owns 23 percent of Baozun through the company’s investment unit Alibaba Investment Ltd. It is currently Baozun’s largest investor. After the offering, its stake will fall to 18.2 percent and its voting power will reduce to 10 percent.
Financial Info

Baozun generates revenue in two ways: product sales and services. The company centers on one of three business models: distribution model, service fee model, and consignment model or combination of all three.

	Product sales revenues are generated when Baozun sells products to customers under the distribution model.

	Services revenue is obtained under the service fee and consignment models. Services consist of IT services, online store operations services, digital marketing, and other services such as payment collection.

	Total revenue including product sales and services increased 65 percent from $154 million in 2012 to $255 million in 2014. Revenue for the first quarter ending March 31 2015 increased 77 percent to $77.0 million from $43.3 million in 2014. Product sales makes up the majority of Baozun’s revenue.

	Q1 2014 sales were $31.9 million compared with $57.1 million in 2015. Services revenue during the same time period in 2014 was $11.4 million versus $19.9 million in 2015.

	Most of the company’s losses are rooted in operating expenses, which includes cost of products, fulfillment, sales and marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative expenses. From Baozun’s distribution model, its biggest costs are derived from its products which is purchase price, shipping charges, and inventory write-downs.

	Cost of products increased in Q1 of 2015 to $52.1 million from $29.4 million in 2014.

	The company has yet to be profitable.

Baozun’s net losses for 2012 to 2014 were: ($7.61) million, ($6.08) million, and ($9.65) million. This year’s Q1 loss of $321,000 in March increased 13 percent from a loss of $284,000 in 2014 for Q1.

Baozun has $137.6 million in assets, of which $28.4 million is cash. The company’s total debt is $59.1 million with the majority in $47.6 million in accounts payable.
Conclusion And Pricing Info

	Throughout the recent years, e-commerce has gained immense popularity in China with players there such as Alibaba and JD.Com Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ: JD) becoming household names. This e-commerce boom in China is only expected to grow as global brands work to penetrate the Chinese market.

Baozun is already well-positioned as a market leader to increase revenue from remarkable growth rates expected in Chinese e-commerce.

Baozun expects to net $129 million from the IPO proceeds. It intends to use the net proceeds in the following manner:


		$32.2 million for sales and marketing activities

		$25.8 million for R&D and technology infrastructure

		 $12.9 million for the expansion of its warehousing and fulfillment infrastructure

		Any remaining proceeds will be used for corporate purposes, working capital, potential acquisitions, investments and alliances


	The lead underwriters to deliver the American Depository Shares (ADSs) are Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and BofA Merrill Lynch. Baozun will offer 11 million ADSs on the NASDAQ under the ticker BZUN on Thursday, May 21.

	The shares are expected to price between $12 and $14 per share. Each ADS is worth three Class A ordinary shares, giving shareholders one vote each in shareholder votes. The company is expected to price Wednesday night.

N+1 Singer - IQE - VCSEL ramp up just the start

IQE’s trading update confirmed that it has secured multiple, multi-year contracts for VCSEL wafers, which we believe relate to 3D sensing opportunities, the most high profile of which is the 10th anniversary iPhone. We are upgrading our FY’17/’18/’19 EPS forecasts by 5%/6%/10% respectively however we believe these forecasts remain very conservative. Assuming a more optimistic level of adoption for the expected new iPhone results in a bull case scenario of 81% EPS upgrades in FY’18. IQE is one of our Key Buys for 2017, a stance which has served us well so far (+185% YTD). With forecasts conservatively struck and multiple additional near-term opportunities outside of Apple on the horizon, we believe the shares will continue to perform. We increase our target price to 147p and retain our Buy recommendation.

Start of mass market VCSEL ramp-up

IQE’s pre-close trading update notes a 16% year-on-year increase in wafer revenues in H117, driven by strong double-digit growth in photonics and currency tailwinds. Importantly, the photonics growth heralds the start of a mass-market ramp up in VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting laser) wafers for consumer applications, encouraging management to proceed with plans to substantially expand capacity ahead of anticipated demand in H218. We make modest upwards revisions to our estimates, noting the potential for further upgrades as there is greater clarity on photonics volumes.

Guardian accelerates through H2

The computer vision based human sensing technologies developer has issued one of its regular updates on progress in the fleet retrofit operations (Guardian). Following the sale of the off-road operations to CAT, this business is core to providing revenue while the Automotive OEM business gains traction over the next few years. The unit has performed impressively, adding A$13m of Total Contract Value (TCV) in Q4 to make A$29m signed in the year and $36.5m cumulatively. These are generally under 3 or 5-year contracts, therefore underpinning future revenue expectations. Guardian now has 130 fleet customers globally, including the US and UK, with more expected imminently. A FY 2017 update for the wider group will be available in August.

Head in the Cloud

We can see no storm approaching. Indeed, with each set of results such as today’s interims we are gathering evidence that the cloud transition strategy is going by the playbook, and the latest set of KPIs clearly indicates further progress. The momentum should be maintained as StatPro expands its product and geographical roadmap. The stock has appreciated by 51% since 7 April 2017 when the company announced the transformational acquisition of UBS Delta. This is equivalent to 32% outperformance against the average for the UK Fintech sector. Interim numbers are in line with our expectations and our full year target. Therefore, we make no changes to our forecasts, and maintain our Buy recommendation and 206p Target Price.

Returns to organic growth, cash flow jumps

StatPro reported healthy interims with revenue up 23%, including 2% organic growth. Annualised recurring revenue (ARR) rose by 47% to £53.2m as at 30 June, boosted by the acquisition of UBS Delta in April. Adjusted EBITDA jumped by 35% to £2.8m as the margin expanded by 120bp to 12.9%, reflecting the increased scale of the business. We are reviewing our forecasts. Management says that the integration of Delta is on track, and we continue to see strong upside potential, given the significant valuation disparity between StatPro and its US-listed financial software peers.

Advanced Materials – the building blocks of Tomorrow’s World

Whether we know it or not, advanced materials are a core component in the everyday life of the everyday person. They are the key material in items we often disregard, such as printer inks and lotions, to objects which defy the laws of gravity like the Airbus A380 and London’s Shard. Furthermore, these materials are not only essential to many objects and structures, but, due to their superior qualities, are the key to the advancement of many industries. One such example is the use of carbon fibre which offers five to ten times more rigidness, stiffness, and strength than its aluminium counterpart. As a result of these impressive qualities, motorsport and athletics have improved ten-fold since their mainstream use and new records are broken every year.

Interims in line with a positive outlook

StatPro’s FY 2017E interim results reflect solid growth and the expected currency tailwind. Reported revenue increased by 23%, adjusted EBITDA was up 35% while adjusted EPS grew by 64%. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.85p. The period saw the acquisition of UBS Delta in April; a front office focused risk and performance analytics service noted for its fixed income risk and attribution capabilities. Integration is progressing to plan. As flagged in the recent trading update, annualised recurring revenue (ARR) had improved further by the end of the half year – boosted by the acquisition of Delta. Over four-fifths of StatPro’s software ARR now comes from its cloud services and CEO Justin Wheatley expects margins to improve as the Group benefits from its greater scale and operational gearing. The outlook statement strikes a positive tone for the second half. With several contract extensions and expansions announced in H1, and a full half year contribution from Delta to come in H2, we leave estimates unchanged.

N+1 Singer - IQE - Photonics ramp up begins in earnest

IQE’s H1’17 trading update confirms a strong first half, with multiple photonics programmes ramping up, which should deliver very strong growth in Photonics revenue in future periods. The group has confirmed that it has secured multiple, multi-year contracts for VCSEL wafers, which we believe relate to 3D sensing opportunities, the most high profile of which is the 10th anniversary iPhone. In order to deliver the expected increase in demand, the board has authorised a capacity expansion plan, which initially includes c.£15m of tools orders. The group has also agreed heads of terms for the lease of new premises in South Wales with the Cardiff City Region. IQE is one of our key picks for the year and we believe the group is in the very early stages of a significant ramp up in Photonics. Management are guiding to modest upgrades in FY’17 and FY’18 this morning, however we believe that eventual EPS upgrades to the FY’18 exit run rate could be closer to 75% (40% on a full taxed basis).

High margin growth strategy accelerated

RedstoneConnect (Redstone) has acquired Anders & Kern for £1.4m and raised further funds to accelerate the development and market penetration of OneSpace. It has raised £6.5m at 1.5p, a 3% discount to the price on 8th May. We are leaving our FY18 PBT unchanged at £2.2m, but have increased our FY19 PBT forecast by 19% to £3.6m. For FY20 we expect a PBT of £4.1m implying a 3yr (2020-2017) CAGR for PBT of 49%. Moreover, we calculate the acquisition creates shareholder value with a ROCE of 30%. We increase our price target from 2.2p to 2.5p and maintain our buy recommendation with Redstone now trading on a PE rating of 16x and 12x for the year’s ending January 2018 and 2019.
