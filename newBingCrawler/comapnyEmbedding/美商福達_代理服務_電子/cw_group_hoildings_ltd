創達科技控股有限公司，簡稱創達科技控股，以及創達科技，（英语：CW Group Holdings Limited，港交所：1322），前名為創興集團控股有限公司，是一家從事精密工程解決方案供應商以及製造機床的公司。
創興集團在2012年3月在香港進行公開招股，招股價介乎1.33至1.73港元，集資最多2.811億元。創興集團引入了七匹狼為首次公開發售前投資者。[1]其後，創興集團被創興銀行指控中文名稱涉及商標侵權及假冒，因而取消上市。創興集團原名為綽偉集團，因旗下產品自2006年起使用創興為公司品牌，因而在2012年2月21日易名為創興集團。[2]
最後經雙方修訂異議，「創興」及「Chong Hing」只能用於香港地區，故此押後在2012年4月13日於香港交易所主板上市[3]。
在2015年4月30日接到港交所通告，擬正式採納中文名稱「創達科技控股有限公司」為本公司雙重外文名稱，已被開曼群島公司註冊處批准[4]。

Levered/Unlevered Beta of CW Group Holdings Limited ( 1322 | CYM)Beta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of a stock against the volatility of the broader market, which is typically measured by a reference market index. Since the market is the benchmark, the market's beta is always 1. When a stock has a beta greater than 1, it means the stock is expected to increase by more than the market in up markets and decrease more than the market in down markets. Conversely, a stock with a beta lower than 1 is expected to rise less than the market when the market is moving up , but fall less than the market when the market is moving down. Despite being rare, a stock may have a negative beta, which means the stock moves opposite the general market trend.CW Group Holdings Limited shows a Beta of 3.25.This is higher than 1. The volatility of CW Group Holdings Limited according to this measure is higher than the market volatility.Beta (Ref: HSI)

More...Did you know ?Infinancials' Beta calculator allows you to define your input parameters for custom beta calculations.The beta calculator offers additional flexibility, such as:- Reference index: apply the same reference index for all companies in your list regardless of their country.- Sampling frequency: choose between a weekly or a monthly sampling frequency for the closing prices.- Debt for unlevered beta: choose the type of debt to be used for unlevered beta calculations.- Additional beta statistics: calculate R-squared and T-value.About BetaStandard beta is co-called levered, which means that it reflects the capital structure of the company (including the financial risk linked to the debt level). Unlevered beta (or ungeared beta) compares the risk of an unlevered company (i.e. with no debt in the capital structure) to the risk of the market. Unlevered beta is useful when comparing companies with different capital structures as it focuses on the equity risk. Unlevered beta is generally lower than the levered beta. However, unlevered beta could be higher than levered beta when the net debt is negative (meaning that the company has more cash than debt).Many different betas can be calculated for a given stock. The main common variables that affect beta calculations are the time period, the reference date, the sampling frequency for closing prices and the reference index.The calculation divides the covariance of the stock return with the market return by the variance of the market return. Beta is used very often for company valuation using the Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) method. The discount rate is calculated using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC is essentially a blend of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt. The cost of equity is usually calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which defines the cost of equity as follows: re = rf + β × (rm - rf)Where:rf = Risk-free rateβ = Beta (levered)(rm - rf) = Market risk premium.
