1. Overview Materials
About Green-e Energy. A one-page description of the Green-e Energy program.
2. Standards and Governing Documents
Green-e Framework for Renewable Energy Certification provides baseline criteria for regional and country-specific Green-e standards. (NEW)

Appendix B: Green-e Energy Code of Conduct is one of the main governing documents of Green-e Energy, and outlines requirements for consumer protection and environmental standards.
Appendix D: Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States (formerly Green-e Energy National Standard), v3.1. Covers renewable resource eligibility and product specifications. (The changes from v3.0 can be viewed here.)
 Reporting requirements for certification of long-term contracts that meet the requirements of Section II.H of the Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States To meet the requirements of Section II.H, the list of non-residential end-use purchasers of the contracted supply in the Green-e Energy certified transaction must be reported to Green-e according to the below deadlines. "Green-e Eligibility Date" is defined as the date of Green-e Energy eligibility per Section II.E.1–7.
Green-e Eligibility Date
Deadline for Green-e Reporting
July 1, 2016–June 30, 2017
March 31, 2018
July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018
March 31, 2019
July 1, 2018–June 30, 2019
March 31, 2020
July 1, 2019–June 30, 2020
March 31, 2021
	NOTE: Section II.H of the Green-e Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States also requires that eligible contracts be signed with 12 months of the generation's Green-e Energy Eligibility Date.
Appendix I: Green-e Glossary helps explain and define terms used in Green-e governing documents.
Green-e Direct Governing Documents (Supplemental)
In addition to the Standards and Governing Documents above, the following supplemental documents are also required for participants in Green-e Direct.
Appendix A: Green-e Direct Program Requirements
California Enhanced Community Renewables (ECR) Documents
Green-e ECR Developer and Generator Requirements. A detailed list of processes and requirements for developers to follow when participating in the CA ECR Program.
Green-e Energy ECR Utility Requirements. A detailed list of processes and requirements for utilities to follow when participating in the CA ECR Program.
Tracking Attestation for Electricity and RECs. A required attestation for project developers.
Green-e ECR Developer Cover Sheet
Green-e ECR Marketing Webinar Slides. A presentation on "Developer Marketing Requirements and Submission Details for California's Enhanced Community Renewables Program" from September 2016.
4. Guidance Documents
2017 Residual Mix Emissions Rates. Green-e Energy annually publishes "Residual Mix" emissions rates, which are CO2 emissions rates that should be applied to all electricity use that is not associated with a Green-e Energy certified product or for which a more specific set of emissions data is not available. These rates are compatible with the World Resources Institute's (WRI's) guidance. (see also 2016 and 2015 Residual Mix Emissions Rates)
Green-e Energy Summary of WRI Scope 2 Guidance summarizes the major takeaways from WRI's Scope 2 accounting guidelines as well as required and optional reporting under this guidance.

5. Attestation Forms for Facilities Within a Tracking System
These forms are used to substantiate the chain of custody of all renewable MWh (renewable electricity or standalone RECs) used in Green-e Energy certified sales. Renewable energy generators must be registered in one or more of the following approved tracking systems: ERCOT, MIRECS, MRETS, NAR, NCRETS, NEPOOL GIS, NYGATS, PJMGATS, and WREGIS.
Tracking Attestation for Electricity and RECs, to be signed by generators selling renewables through an approved electronic Tracking System and want to be pre-screened for Green-e Energy eligibility.
6. Attestation Forms for Facilities Not in a Tracking System
Attestations for sales of RECs and renewable electricity from facilities not registered in an Electronic Tracking System. These do not grant any specific Green-e Energy eligibility status; the ultimate determination of eligibility lies with Green-e Energy staff during the annual verification audit. Facilities not in a Tracking System may only use these forms.
Generator Attestation for Electricity and RECs
Wholesale Attestation for Electricity and RECs
Small Generator Attestation, for RECs from facilities 10 kW or less.
Non-Gaseous Biomass Generator Attestation for Electricity and RECs. This form is necessary for all non-gaseous biomass facilities not registered in a tracking system.

PCL22 Series Panel Indicators
VCC's PCL22 series panel indicators feature a modern design led pilot light for advance light diffusion, in several colors for easy application in different environments



The PCL22 series high performance from VCC feature an LED pilot light with advance light diffusion technology which eliminate hot spots. They are high performance for industrial applications with simple installation and simple integration for industrial controls and retrofit panel mount applications. Diffused translucent lenses provide uniform illumination and are designed for applications that require a wide viewing angle. They are available in five single colors (red, green, white, blue, or yellow) and in bi-color (red/green). These indicators are ideal for critical applications where the presence of indications is crucial or where lamp replacement is difficult or costly. As well as being dust and water tight to IP65, the pilot lights are vibration resistant.
