We love IPOs
The IPO market provides a magical window into the most exciting technologies, emerging consumer trends and important business developments - all testing their mettle in the crucible of the public markets. We are constantly learning and researching to deliver the best insights available.










We are independent
We have no vested interests driving our work. All the investment banks and brokers on a deal are paid to do a sales and marketing job. Our job is to remain objective and use a fact-based approach to evaluate the potential for an IPO.










We get the best ratings
IPO Candy has been recognized since 2009 as the single best place to get commentary, analysis and assets in the IPO market. The most common write-in comment we get from users is that they "love what we do."










We share everything we know

Press Ganey Introduces First Quality Indicator to Measure Assaults on Nursing Personnel with Unit-Level Data and Comparisons
Aug 2 17
Press Ganey announced nursing-sensitive quality indicator for Assaults on Nursing Personnel with unit-level data and comparatives. The indicator, part of Press Ganey's National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators® (NDNQI®) Solution, was developed to help hospitals better understand and assess workplace safety and rates of violence against nurses at a time when these are reported to be at epidemic levels.  Development of the measure supports the company's focus on nursing excellence and follows its recent proprietary analyses that found significant relationships between nurse perceptions of workplace safety, and patient experience and clinical outcomes. The scientific measurement and data collection process of the NDNQI solution better equips organizations to take steps to prevent workplace violence and improve nurse and patient outcomes. Powerful unit-level data and reporting enable targeted action planning and intervention for specific units. The new indicator's innovative insights raise the bar on the standard of nursing excellence by acknowledging and supporting the safety of nurses and the importance of their work environment in driving the delivery of safe, high-quality care. The indicator also can be used to help organizations meet the EP18EO requirement for the Magnet Recognition Program®.
