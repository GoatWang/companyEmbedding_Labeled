        TIE Kinetix (hereinafter "TIE"), the leading provider of cloud-managed Business Integration, E-Commerce, Demand Generation, and Business Analytics services today released the results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 (Oct 1, 2015 - Sept 30, 2016) as follows:
      

Highlights full year 2016


Highlights Q4


        In 2016, the company was able to replace lost SaaS revenue from KPN Hi/Telfort with new customer implementations, growing overall SaaS revenue with 7%. Consultancy revenue and Other Income came in below 2015 levels, caused by is 1) loss of KPN revenue due to the discontinuation of the Hi/Telfort labels, and 2) a further reduction of EU projects and 3) the expiration of Tomorrow Focus AG revenue guarantees/contractual fees to TIE Kinetix GmbH. These revenue reductions have been anticipated with cost reductions taken in prior periods. The EU team has been downsized and refocused towards developing FLOW. The Ecommerce delivery team was downsized to only provision T-Mobile. Furthermore, operating costs have been reduced due to a shift in product development towards FLOW as planned. As a result, anticipating lower sales, operating expenses in 2016 came in below 2015 levels and EBITDA performance developed according to plan. In 2017, the planned transition towards a homogeneous FLOW based product suite will continue. At this stage, it cannot be excluded that the build-up of FLOW revenue is insufficient to replace the discontinuation of non-core products. This may set limitations to top line growth in FY 2017.

        After the introduction of FLOW (April 2016), significant marketing investments were made to bring the product to our US and European markets. All our sales staff, delivery teams and partners have been trained in product functionality. Since the introduction, email campaigns with 10.000's emails per month have been launched in all our markets, generating 1.000's of prospects and 100's of leads. Our prospects and customers are receiving FLOW positively and in a relatively short period after the introduction TIE Kinetix was able to close FLOW deals with customers Drabbe, Unify, Nuance, Xerox, Dell, Svedex and Michelin (France). The Q4 revenue impact of FLOW was limited since most of these deals came in late Q4.
      

        TIE closed the fourth quarter, with revenue amounting to € 4.935k, and EBITDA of € 718k (14,5%). The company reports full year revenue of € 20.250k (2015: € 22.263k) with an EBITDA of € 2.065k (2015: € -134k). Growth is reported in Integration (+14%), revenue of the business lines A&O and Demand Generation consolidated (with -3% and -4% respectively) and the business line E-Commerce business declined with 37%. The following highlights the developments in our four business lines throughout our financial year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015 - Sept. 30, 2016):
      


          Business Integration: we have been able to build on our strong position in our vertical markets such as food retail, publishing, do-it-yourself, telecommunications and automotive in the US and the Netherlands with Order Intake increasing 10% from €6.2 million (2015) to € 6,8 million (2016). In fiscal year 2016, our Business Integration revenue grew with 14% from € 9.804k (2015) to € 11.157k (2016).
        

          Analytics: the build out of our A&O business has suffered from Google's decision not to deliver the Google Search Appliance product in the license model to new customers anymore, anticipating the introduction of their SaaS delivery model. As a consequence, the revenue of this business line consolidated around € 3.2 million and the Order Intake declined from €3.3 million (2015) to € 2 million (2016).
        

          Demand Generation: revenue of our Demand Generation Solution grew 32% from € 1.678k (2015) to € 2.229k (2016). We also report our German hosting customers under Demand Generation. This part reported a decline in revenue with 26% from € 2.888k (2015) to € 2.145k (2016) due to price erosion and fierce competition in the hosting market. A further decline of this revenue may be expected in FY 2017.
        

          E-commerce: our E-commerce proposition delivers webshop solutions with full back office integrations. Historically, our customers are large telecommunications companies such as KPN and T-Mobile for whom we provision complete webshop functionality. In 2016, the termination of the KPN contract, following a consolidation of its customer labels, is reflected in lower revenue. The contract with T-Mobile expires mid FY 2017 and is currently subject to renewal review. In 2016, T-Mobile is our largest customer. In 2016, the E-commerce revenue declined with 37% from € 3.217k (2015) to € 2.041k (2016).
        


Jan Sundelin (CEO) said:"2016 is an important year in the existence of the company. This was the first year in which we were able to fully combine our highly rated back-end integration expertise with front end channel management functionality. The result was the mid-year introduction of FLOW: "the world's First Self Service Partner Automation Platform", a truly novel solution bringing together all our product functionality in one self-service platform. We intend to continue our investments in further development, marketing and sales of FLOW in the coming years. 2016 was also the year in which the company has further homogenized its product suite. Our overall Q4 revenue came in below Q4 last year, as we strive to discontinue certain non-strategic activities, such as EU projects and other bespoke type of business, and replace that with our core FLOW solutions. This conversion process of our business will take at least another year. At the same time, our quarter on quarter increasing bottom line profitability confirms to us that we are on the right track".

13/04/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 14/04/2017 01:42
TIE Kinetix announces the Business-to-Government-Invoicing add-on for Exact users







The new TIE Kinetix's Business-to-Government (B2G) e-Invoicing offering provides Exact customers with functionality, that allows them to send electronic invoices to national and provincial institutions, local municipalities and other governmental institutions in a reliable and secure way.


By combining TIE Kinetix's electronic invoice services with Exact, users are able to easily deal electronically with any member of the public sector in a timely manner. TIE Kinetix is a good match with Exact because of their international footprint, their matching quality and requirements, their service and price levels, and their time-to-onboard.


The U.S. and European governments and businesses each process almost 25 billion invoices annually. For both Europe and the U.S. € 240 billion could be saved in the next six years. The European Commission mandates all Member States to accept electronic invoices compliant with a common semantic model by 2018. TIE Kinetix's Business-to-Government e-Invoicing add-on makes it very easy for businesses to keep doing business with government organizations securely and ensures compliance to all international and local standards.


Jan Sundelin, CEO of TIE Kinetix:"The demand for exchanging invoices securely via a direct connection from the ERP environment is a trend we have been noticing over the last year. Our new partnership with Exact, to offer a fully integrated solution directly connected with Exact's software, shows how increasingly important these secure document exchange connections are becoming. Together we offer a total integrated solution via our FLOW Partner Automation Cloud based Platform that offers our joint customers stability, security, and reliability.


Jarno van Hurne, ‎Global Product Marketing Director of Exact:"e-Invoicing has many advantages. It saves a lot of manual interaction, decreases the chance on errors and is better for the environment as well by decreasing paper usage and transportation costs. The exchange between Exact software and TIE Kinetix is an important step forward to let our joint customers make use of e-invoicing. This fits with our vision on the future of finance and our 'no hands' accounting concept."
