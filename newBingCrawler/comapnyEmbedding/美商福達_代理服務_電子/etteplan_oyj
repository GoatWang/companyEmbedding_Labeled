A service product for global item management from Etteplan



Etteplan Oyj  7.6.2012, 10:15






- Etteplan’s service offering is growing in accordance with the company’s strategy. The Etteplan ITEM service product was developed for the item management needs of globally operating companies.
Etteplan, specialists in industrial equipment engineering and technical product information solutions, is an industry forerunner in the development of productized service solutions. The company’s latest service product, called Etteplan ITEM, offers manufacturing companies cost-effectiveness and high quality for their item management – centrally, regardless of the location of their facilities.
Item, in this sense, refers to the names and IDs of all components and spare parts required for a product’s entire life cycle. Etteplan ITEM brings companies major cost savings, as the item database is unified and the optimized database is centrally managed and maintained. When the operations of companies are distributed across several regions, the efficiency of item management is highlighted even more.
Etteplan’s service is unique in the markets, as the company can offer its customers item creation and maintenance service on 24/7 basis, thanks to its operations in China. Etteplan’s ITEM service is used by Metso Minerals Oy, among other companies.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

ETTEPLAN OYJ      STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE      NOVEMBER 23, 2009 AT 09.00 A.M.   


ETTEPLAN OYJ'S UPDATED STRATEGY: SMART WAY TO SMART PRODUCTS

their fields. In the updated strategy, Etteplan aims to be the number one       
partner in technical design and product information for its customers and offers
competence of the whole company more effectively to the use of the current and  
new customers. To speed up the process, company is grouping its service offering
in a new way. Etteplan seeks competitive advantage in versatile cutting edge    
competence of engineering design areas, ability to manage engineering processes 
effectively and customer-oriented operational practice.                         

With the help of the updated strategy company aims to improve its current strong
market position and to ensure at least 10% annual organic growth. Good current  
clientele creates a strong base for the growth.                                 

Service areas                                                                   

Etteplan serves its customers by providing technical design and product         
information solutions for all phases of the life cycle of customers' products.  
In the updated strategy, Etteplan's service offering is divided into two service
areas, which are described by the value promise: Smart way to smart products.   

Operational services - Smart way                                                

The aim of Operational services is to increase efficiency of customers'         
technical design and product information as well as to release customer         
organisation's resources to its own core business. Services are based on        
Etteplan's long experience and customer references in developing and managing   
design processes. Operational services include productized design and technical 
product information outsourcing services, project deliveries and supply of      
design capacity.                                                                

Expertise services - Smart products                                             

Expertise services aim to improve competitiveness of customers' products' by    
offering flexibly special technical competence that represents field's best     
development and experience. Expertise services include energy efficient         
solutions for machines and equipments, testing services, innovation and product 
development services for medical technology equipment manufacturers, requirement

development services for aerospace and defence equipment industry, design of    
embedded systems as well as services related to design and development of       
industrial infrastructure.                                                      

Focus areas of strategy                                                         

Etteplan develops its operational practices, according to the updated strategy, 
in three areas: customer-orientation, productization of service solutions and   
operational excellence.                                                         

Etteplan has previously operated according to decentralized and localized       
operational practices. The new operational practice supports the aim of         
Etteplan's current and new customers to decrease the number of partners by      
offering broader service packages. By utilizing its experience, competence and  
strong market position Etteplan aims to be the number one partner in all areas  
of machine and equipment design and technical product information.              

During the autumn 2009, Etteplan has productized new service solutions.         
Productization brings Etteplan's business a scalability advantage. The launch   
and sale of the new service products is going to commence in the beginning of   
year 2010. Productization and development work of services will be continued    
during the strategy period.
