(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those statements, which appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We use words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "may," "will" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Discussions containing forward-looking statements may be found in the material set forth under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in other sections of this report. All forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, projections, expectations or estimates concerning our business, including demand for our products and services, mix of revenue sources, ability to control and/or reduce operating expenses, anticipated gross margins and operating results, cost savings, product development efforts, general outlook of our business and industry, future profits or losses, competitive position, share-based compensation, adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements, are inherently uncertain as they are based on our expectations and assumptions concerning future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited to, the possibility that we may fail to maintain or grow our listings advertiser base and/or distribution network, that existing and potential distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or pricing terms, that we may be unable to grow our online search advertising revenue and/or find alternative sources of revenue, that we may be unable to attain or maintain customer acceptance of our publisher solutions products, that changes in the distribution network composition may lead to decreases in query volumes, that we may be unable to maintain or improve our query volume, match rate, number of paid clicks, average revenue per click, conversion rate or other ad network metrics, that we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability, that we may be unable to retain our existing credit facilities or obtain new credit facilities, that we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses, that we may be unable to remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or that one or more of the other risks described elsewhere in this report may occur.  All forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and except as required by applicable law; we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, there had been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.  Business Overview  For a description of our business, please refer to Note 1.  Results of Operations Overview of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 The following tables set forth selected information concerning our results of operations as a percentage of consolidated net revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Revenue $ 1,885 100.0 % $ 1,111 100.0 % $ 774 70 % Cost of revenue 1,434 76.1 % 490 44.1 % 944 193 % Gross profit 451 23.9 % 621 55.9 % (170 ) (27 )% Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 96 5.1 % 262 23.6 % (166 ) (63 )% Product development and technical operations 343 18.2 % 598 53.8 % (255 ) (43 )% General and administrative 203 10.8 % 358 32.2 % (155 ) (43 )% Restructuring charge - 0.1 % 19 1.7 % (19 ) (100 )% Total operating expenses 642 34.1 % 1,237 111.3 % (595 ) (48 )% Income loss from operations (191 ) (10.1 )% (616 ) (55.4 )% 425 (69 )% Non-operating income (expense), net (15 ) (0.8 )% (17 ) (1.5 )% 2 (12 )% Loss from operations before income taxes (206 ) (10.9 )% (633 ) (57.0 )% 427 (67 )% Income tax expense - - - - - - Net loss $ (206 ) (10.9 )% $ (633 ) (57.0 )% $ 427 (67 )%   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Revenue $ 3,715 100.0 % $ 3,115 100.0 % $ 600 19 % Cost of revenue 2,519 67.8 % 1,354 43.5 % 1,165 86 % Gross profit 1,196 32.2 % 1,761 56.5 % (565 ) (32 )% Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 371 10.0 % 965 31.0 % (594 ) (62 )% Product development and technical operations 1,200 32.3 % 1,931 62.0 % (731 ) (38 )% General and administrative 640 17.2 % 1,165 37.4 % (525 ) (45 )% Restructuring charge 9 0.3 % 312 10.1 % (303 ) (97 )% Total operating expenses 2,220 59.8 % 4,373 140.4 % (2,153 ) (49 )% Loss from operations (1,024 ) (27.6 )% (2,612 ) (83.9 )% 1,588 (61 )% Non-operating income (expense), net (48 ) (1.3 )% (20 ) (0.6 )% (28 ) 140 % Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (1,072 ) (28.9 )% (2,632 ) (84.5 )% 1,560 (59 )% Income tax expense - - - 0.0 % - 0 % Net loss $ (1,072 ) (28.9 )% $ (2,632 ) (84.4 )% $ 1,560 (59 )%  Revenue  Revenue is derived from two service offerings or "products" of LookSmart Group (the "Company"): Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions. Total revenue and revenue from Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, was as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Advertiser Networks $ 1,885 100 % $ 1,111 100 % $ 774 70 % Publisher Solutions - - 0 % - 0 % Total revenue $ 1,885 100 % $ 1,111 100 % $ 774 70 % Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Advertiser Networks $ 3,715 100 % $ 3,114 100 % $ 601 19 % Publisher Solutions - 0 % 1 0 % (1 ) (100 )% Total revenue $ 3,715 100 % $ 3,115 100 % $ 600 19 %  Advertiser Networks  The decrease in Advertiser Networks revenue for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 is the result of a reduction in revenues from all categories: Intermediaries, Direct Advertisers and Self Service Advertisers. We experienced a continuing decrease in Advertising Network revenue in the Nine Months of 2016 following a trend that began in late 2011.  In the Nine Months of 2016, revenue from Intermediaries decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.  In the Nine Months of 2016, revenue from Direct Advertisers decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.  In the Nine Months of 2016, revenue from Self Service Advertisers decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  Cost of revenue is primarily TAC (costs paid to our distribution network partners). Other costs include data center rent and power usage and credit card fees.  Cost of revenue for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Traffic acquisition costs $ 1,205 64 % $ 420 38 % $ 785 187 % Other costs 229 12 % 70 5 % 159 227 % Total cost of revenue $ 1,434 76 % $ 490 44 % $ 944 193 % Traffic acquisition costs as percentage of Advertiser Network revenue 64 % 38 % Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Traffic acquisition costs $ 2,074 56 % $ 1,211 39 % $ 863 71 % Other costs 445 12 % 143 5 % 302 211 % Total cost of revenue $ 2,519 68 % $ 1,354 43 % $ 1,165 86 % Traffic acquisition costs as percentage of Advertiser Network revenue 56 % 39 %  TAC increased $0.79 and $0.86 in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Certain other costs, such as data center costs and power usage, are generally fixed costs. Total cost of revenue decreased in 2016 primarily as result of decreases of TAC combined with decreases in other costs in the current year.  TAC as a percentage of Advertiser Network revenue increased to 64% and 56% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 38% and 39% in the same period in 2015 as a result of overall revenue mix changes from 2015 to 2016.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, decreased by $0.6 million and $2.15 million. Contributing factors included decreases in sales and marketing costs, product and development costs, general and administrative costs.  Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, product development and technical operations, general and administrative, and restructuring charges for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, and were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Sales and marketing $ 96 5 % $ 262 24 % $ (166 ) (63 )% Product development and technical operations 343 18 % 598 54 % (255 ) (43 )% General and administrative 203 10 % 358 32 % (155 ) (43 )% Restructuring charge 0 0 % 19 # - (19 ) (100 )% Total operating expenses $ 642 33 % $ 1,237 110 % $ (595 ) (48 )% Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change % Change Sales and marketing $ 371 10 % $ 965 31 % $ (594 ) (62 )% Product development and technical operations 1,200 32 % 1,931 62 % (731 ) (38 )% General and administrative 640 17 % 1,165 37 % (525 ) (45 )% Restructuring charge 9 0 % 312 10 % (303 ) (97 )% Total operating expenses $ 2,220 59 % $ 4,373 140 % $ (2,153 ) (49 )%  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses in the current year include salaries, share-based compensation and other costs of employment for our sales force, sales administration and customer service staff and marketing personnel, overhead, facilities and allocation of depreciation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of advertising, trade shows, public relations activities and various other activities supporting our customer acquisition effort.  The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, reflects a reduction in our sales and marketing personnel.  Product Development and Technical Operations  Product development and technical operations expense includes all costs related to the continued operations, development and enhancement of our core technology product, the AdCenter platform. The AdCenter is used to operate both our own Advertiser Network and other publishers' client networks, and is licensed to publishers to operate their own network. These costs include salaries and associated costs of employment, including share-based compensation, overhead, and facilities. Software licensing and computer equipment depreciation related to supporting product development and technical operations functions are also included in product development and technical operations expense.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses include personnel cost, legal, insurance, tax and accounting, consulting, professional services fees and the provision for, and reductions of, the allowance for doubtful trade receivables.  Other Items The tables below set forth other continuing operations data for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar % 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change Change Non-operating income (expense), net Interest income $ - 0 % $ - 0 % $ - 0 % Interest expense (16 ) 0 % (17 ) 0 % 1 0 % Other income, net 1 0 % - 0 % 1 0 % Total non-operating income  Income tax expense $ - - $ - - $ - -   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 % of % of Dollar 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue Change % Change Non-operating income (expense), net Interest income $ - 0 % $ - 0 % $ - 0 % Interest expense (47 ) - (18 ) - (29 ) 161 % Other income (expense), net (1 ) 0 % (2 ) - 1 (50 )% Total non-operating income (expense), net $ (48 ) 0 % $ (20 ) -1 % $ (28 ) 140 % Income tax expense $ - - $ - - $ - -  Interest Income and Expense  Interest expense, primarily consisting of interest paid on capital leases, during the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, increased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the loan we obtained from Inca Capital starting May 2015. (Please see Other Obligations)  Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows were as follows for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2016 2015 Change Net cash used in operating activities $ (368 ) $ (2,027 ) $ 1659 Net cash provided by investing activities (290 ) 290 Net cash used in financing activities 430 2,136 (1,706 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1 ) 26 (27 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ (155 ) $ 216  Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances were as follows as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):   September 30, December 31, 2016 2015 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 268 $ 207 $ 61 Short-term investments 36 36 - Total $ 304 $ 243 $ 61 % of total assets 7 % 5 % Total assets $ 4,144 $ 4,539  At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $0.27 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments. Cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, commercial paper, time deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. corporate securities, collateralized debt obligations and other commodities. We actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold. Our investment policy, which is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors, primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. These balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, "Cash and Available for Sale Securities," which describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments increased $0.03 million to $0.27 million at September 30, 2016, from $0.24 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to financing activities, offset by operating losses. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we generated a minimal positive cash flow from operations.  Our primary source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our current primary use of cash is to fund operating losses and investment in software development. . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services beyond the current quarter, and changes in customer buying behavior. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets continue to remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures, take advantage of favorable business opportunities, develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure, develop new product and service offerings, take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments, including the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution.  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash used in operations in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.386 million and consisted of a net loss of $1.071 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.631 million and cash generated by working capital and other activities of $0.08 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.682 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $0.008 amortization of deferred rent, and $0.043 million in other non-cash charges. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.326 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $0.249 million in accounts receivable and a $0.009 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to decreased TAC and operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.  Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $2.0 million and consisted of a net loss of $2.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.6 million and cash used by working capital and other activities of zero. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment and purchased software. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.3 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $0.11 million in accounts receivable and a $0.22 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.  Investing Activities  Cash provided by investing activities in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was zero.  Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $0.3 million was attributed to $0.4 million purchase of intangible assets partially offset by $0.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments.  Financing Activities  Cash provided by financing activities in the Nine Months of 2016 of $0.43 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities from Snowy August Management, LLC. (See Other Obligations)  Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2015 of $2.1 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities and notes payable, as well as proceeds from additional paid-in capital.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4), investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  . . .  Nov 21, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO and ATHENS, Greece, April 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- LookSmart, Ltd. (NASDAQ:   LOOK) and privately-held Pyxis Tankers Inc. ("Pyxis") today jointly announced that they have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby Pyxis will become a publicly listed company as a result of the merger between LookSmart, Ltd. ("LookSmart") and Pyxis' wholly-owned subsidiary, Maritime Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation. In addition, LookSmart will spin off its existing business into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. ("LookSmart Group").
Pyxis Tankers Inc.
Pyxis Tankers Inc. is a newly formed international maritime transportation company with a focus on the tanker sector. At the consummation of the merger with LookSmart, Pyxis' fleet will be comprised of six double hull product tankers with an average current age of four years and that are employed under a mix of short- and medium-term time charters and spot charters. Pyxis will acquire these six vessels prior to the merger from an affiliate of its founder and chief executive officer, Mr. Valentios ("Eddie") Valentis. Four of the vessels in the fleet will be medium-range, or MR, product tankers, three of which have eco-efficient or eco-modified designs and two will be short-range tanker sister ships. Each of the vessels in the fleet is capable of transporting refined petroleum products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, such as vegetable oils and organic chemicals.
Pyxis' principal objective will be to own and operate its fleet in a manner that will enable it to benefit from short- and long-term trends that Pyxis expects in the product tanker sector to maximize its revenues and to enhance returns to its stockholders. Pyxis intends to expand the fleet through selective acquisitions of modern product tankers in a manner that is accretive to stockholder value. It expects to employ its vessels primarily through time charters to creditworthy customers and on the spot market. Pyxis intends to continually evaluate the markets in which it operates and, based upon its view of market conditions, adjust its mix of vessel employment by counterparty and stagger its charter expirations. In addition, Pyxis may choose to opportunistically direct asset sales when opportunities exist for subsequent accretive vessel acquisitions and conditions are primed to generate attractive returns for its stockholders.
Mr. Valentis commented, "A publicly-traded growth-oriented product tanker company will be created upon closing of the merger that we believe is unique among our competitors. We at Pyxis Tankers look forward to communicating to the LookSmart shareholders and the investment community about our value creation story and growth opportunities."
The Transactions
Spin-Off
Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, LookSmart transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities (including its Clickable, Ad Center and web search businesses) to LookSmart Group. Upon completion of this spin-off, LookSmart Group, will be 100% owned by LookSmart's stockholders of record.
Merger
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, LookSmart will merge with and into Maritime Technologies Corp., which will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pyxis. Upon completion of the merger, each share of LookSmart's common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be exchanged for the right to receive a certain number of shares of Pyxis' common stock equal to $4,000,000, as adjusted for the price and number of LookSmart's outstanding common stock as of the date that the merger becomes effective.  After the completion of the merger, and assuming no adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the public stockholders of LookSmart are expected to own approximately 5.66% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of Pyxis.
Pyxis intends to apply to have its common stock listed on either the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE MKT under the symbol "PXS."
LookSmart's Chief Executive Officer, Michael Onghai, stated, "We are very pleased to give our stockholders this value enhancing transaction. Our stockholders will have an opportunity to also own shares in Pyxis without diluting their existing ownership in LookSmart and its subsidiaries including Clickable, Inc., all of which will be transferred into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. This transaction enables LookSmart Group to remain public with lower costs of being public and more flexibility for its fast-growing subsidiaries to raise capital with alternative sources of financing such as venture capital. At the same time, this transaction offers Pyxis a chance to be listed on a major stock exchange."
The Make Whole Record Date
In the event that subsequent to the Merger, Pyxis completes a financing which results in gross proceeds to Pyxis of at least $5,000,000 (a "Future Pyxis Offering") at a valuation lower than the valuation ascribed to the shares of common stock received by LookSmart stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "Consideration Value"), Pyxis will be obligated to make "whole" the LookSmart stockholders as of April 29, 2015 (the "Make Whole Record Date") by offering such LookSmart stockholders the right to receive additional shares of Pyxis common stock to compensate the LookSmart stockholders for the difference in value of their Pyxis common stock.
In addition, should Pyxis fail to complete a Future Pyxis Offering within a date which is 3 years from the date of the closing of the Merger, each holder of the Company's common stock who has held such stock continuously from the date of the Make Whole Record Date until the expiration of such 3 year period (the "Legacy LS Stockholders") will have a 24-hour option beginning at the end of the 3 year period to require Pyxis to purchase from such Legacy LS Stockholders a pro rata amount of Pyxis common stock that would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Legacy LS Stockholders in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000; provided that in no event shall a Legacy LS Stockholder receive an amount per share greater than the Consideration Value.

	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 




	Nature of Business



	 


	LookSmart Group, Inc.
	(“LookSmart” or the “Company”) is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions
	for search and display advertising customers. LookSmart operates in a large online advertising ecosystem serving ads that target
	user queries on partner sites.


	 


	LookSmart offers search
	advertising customers targeted search via a monitored search advertising distribution network using the Company’s “AdCenter”
	platform technology. The Company’s search advertising network includes publishers and search advertising customers, including
	intermediaries and direct advertising customers and their agencies as well as self-service customers in the United States and certain
	other countries.


	 


	LookSmart also offers
	advertisers the ability to buy graphical display advertising. LookSmart’s trading desk personnel utilize DSP technology and
	licensed data from third party providers to buy targeted advertising on a real-time bidded basis. By leveraging our extensive historical
	search marketing network data along with performance data from a conversion pixel, LookSmart constructs models of the highest performing
	audiences, and targets them via exchange inventory. LookSmart offers its trading desk as a managed service.


	 


	In addition, Looksmart,
	under its “Clickable” and “Syncapse” brands, allows customers to manage paid, owned and earned media by
	providing a suite of solutions for social media marketers that include publishing, monitoring, data storage, compliance, management,
	ad placement and analytics.


	 


	Further, LookSmart offers
	publishers licensed private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher
	Solutions”). Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers
	and portals to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	Lastly, in the fourth
	quarter of 2013 the Company began to make available a LookSmart-branded search engine.  For parties submitting search queries,
	the Company offers free-of-charge search results ranked and presented based on proprietary algorithms.   While
	early in its evolution, part of the Company's current search engine monetization strategy is to generate sponsored search
	results as a part of overall search results and provide links to paying advertisers’ websites.


	 


	In September 2013, LookSmart
	purchased the Syncapse Technology Assets for $3 million from MNP Ltd., a Receiver appointed by Ontario Superior Court of Justice
	under the Appointment Order. Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company acquired a social media platform that allows
	enterprise customers the ability to publish, monitor and analyze their social media presence on paid, owned and earned media. The
	Company has begun to work with large international brands to assist them in creating, maintaining and analyzing their social media
	presence online. As a result of the Syncapse asset purchase, the Company is expanding its offerings to our current customer base.
	Our expanded offering allows LookSmart’s traditional customers the ability to manage ad spend in both search and social platforms.
	The Company intends to partner with social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube, as well as others,
	to offer customers the ability to maximize their ad spend in all relevant ad categories.


	 


	In November
	of 2013, LookSmart acquired an approximately 10,000 square foot Data Center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The Company had acquired
	the facility intending to use the Data Center to support its technology platforms. At present the Company does not need the Data
	Center for its core businesses and is evaluating other uses for the property. The Company may sell the property if that can occur
	on terms acceptable to management.

	In addition, LookSmart
	offers publishers licensed private-label search advertiser network solutions based on its AdCenter platform technology (“Publisher
	Solutions”). Publisher Solutions consist of hosted auction-based ad serving with an ad backfill capability that allows publishers
	and portals to manage their advertiser relationships, distribution channels and accounts.


	 


	On June 3, 2015, LookSmart
	Group, Inc. (“LookSmart” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada. LookSmart Group, Inc.
	was set-up to effect the spun-off from its predecessor, LookSmart Limited (“Predecessor”), as a result of a reverse
	merger and spin-off transaction (the “Transaction”) with Pyxis Tankers(“Pyxis”).


	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction on October 28, 2015. For year to year comparisons, when we refer to the year 2015, we are referring to the Predecessor.


	 


	Prior to the execution
	of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company in anticipation
	of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and the liabilities
	of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common
	stock were cancelled and the Company is 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date set
	for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share of LookSmart Group common
	stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Company’s
	stock is traded in the OTCMarkets Pinksheets.


	 


	On April 5,
	2016 the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Talkwheel.com, Inc. (“Talkwheel”) into the Company’s
	subsidiary Clickable, Inc. (“Clickable”). Talkwheel had established a community analytics platform of web activity
	to unify and analyze a brand’s social media through a visually interactive community platform. During the three months ended
	September 30, 2016, the Company determined that Talkwheel had breached materially representations and warranties in the Asset Purchase
	Agreement dated February 11, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”) governing the purchase of Talkwheel’s assets. As
	a result Clickable terminated the Purchase Agreement and rescinded the transaction.


	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The Unaudited Consolidated
	Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015, include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
	eliminated in consolidation.



	 




	Unaudited Interim Financial Information



	 


	The accompanying Unaudited
	Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, reflect
	all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair representation
	of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the periods shown. These Unaudited
	Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
	Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Consolidated
	Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include
	all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)
	for complete financial statements. The results of operations for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 is not necessarily
	indicative of results to be expected for the full year.



	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The Unaudited Consolidated
	Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
	This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue,
	expenses, and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on various factors
	and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience, experience of other enterprises in the
	same industry, new related events, and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed
	to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
	assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In management’s
	opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement are reflected in the interim periods presented.

	Investments



	 


	The Company invests its
	excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high-quality corporate and government issuers. All highly liquid instruments with
	maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments. All instruments with maturities greater
	than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long-term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities
	in the current operating cycle. Such securities are classified as short-term investments. These securities are classified as available-for-sale
	and carried at fair value.


	 


	Changes in the value of
	these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. Except for declines
	in fair value that are not considered temporary, net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported in the Unaudited
	Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using
	the specific identification method.



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s estimate
	of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and
	gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when
	available. The disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable.
	In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted
	prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. The three
	levels of the hierarchy are as follows:


	 






	Level 1:




	Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
	that we have the ability to access.




	 




	Level 2:




	Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
	identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,
	interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.




	 




	Level 3:




	Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable
	inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.




	 

	 




	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Our online search advertising
	revenue is composed of per-click fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with Intermediaries. The
	per-click fee charged for keyword-targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content,
	up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer. The Company has profit-sharing agreements with several customers
	that call for the sharing of profits and losses. Profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreements. Revenue from
	these profit-sharing agreements is reported net of the customer’s share of profit.


	 


	Revenue also includes revenue share from licensing
	of private-labeled versions of our AdCenter Platform.


	 


	Revenues associated with
	online advertising products, including Advertiser Networks, are generally recognized once collectability is established, delivery
	of services has occurred, all performance obligations have been satisfied, and no refund obligations exist. We pay distribution
	network partners based on clicks on the advertiser’s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network
	partners. These payments are called Traffic Acquisition Costs (“TAC”) and are included in cost of revenue. The revenue
	derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment
	to the distribution network partners. This revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligors to the advertisers
	who are the customers of the advertising service.


	 


	We also enter into agreements
	to provide private-labeled versions of our products, including licenses to the AdCenter platform technology. These license arrangements
	may include some or all of the following elements: revenue-sharing based on the publisher’s customer’s monthly revenue
	generated through the AdCenter application; upfront fees; minimum monthly fees; and other license fees. We recognize upfront fees
	over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance, other license fees over the term of the license, and revenue-sharing
	portions over the period in which such revenue is earned. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable,
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably
	assured.

	We provide a provision
	against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds. The amounts of these provisions
	are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends. The revenue allowance included in trade receivables,
	net is insignificant at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 


	Deferred revenue is recorded
	when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements. Customer deposits are recorded when customers make
	prepayments for online advertising.


	 


	The Company evaluates
	individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-45

	Revenue Recognition

	. We test and record revenue accordingly.



	 




	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



	 


	The Company maintains
	an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments. This valuation
	allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis. The review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates
	to current receivables and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there
	is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company anticipated or for customer-specific
	circumstances, such as bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in trade accounts receivable, net is $0.8 million
	at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense was insignificant
	for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



	 




	Concentrations, Credit Risk and Credit Risk Evaluation




	 




	Concentration of Credit Risk



	 


	Financial instruments
	that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts
	receivable. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company placed its cash equivalents and investments primarily through
	one financial institution, City National Bank (“CNB”), and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage
	limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument. The Company has
	not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant
	credit risk on these funds. The fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices.



	 




	Credit Risk, Customer and Vendor Evaluation



	 


	Accounts receivable are
	typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
	maintains allowances for estimated credit losses. The Company applies judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables
	based primarily on management’s evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and past collection history and records
	a specific allowance. In addition, the Company records an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Historically,
	such losses have been within management’s expectations.


	 


	The following table reflects customers that
	accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable:

	Leasehold improvements

	When assets are retired
	or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts, and
	any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
	incurred. Expenditures that substantially increase an asset’s useful life are capitalized.


	 


	In the fourth quarter
	of 2013, the Company acquired a 10,000 square foot data center facility in Phoenix, Arizona. This facility has allowed the Company
	to consolidate its data needs in a company-owned data center, and should allow for the expansion of its cloud-based offerings to
	its customers.



	 




	Internal-Use Software Development Costs



	 


	The Company capitalizes
	external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal-use computer software and the payroll
	and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing the internal-use computer
	software. These costs are capitalized after certain milestones have been achieved and generally amortized over a three-year period
	once the project is placed in service.


	 


	Management exercises judgment
	in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs, and
	in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs, which is generally three years. The Company expects to continue
	to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs in the future, although no such costs were capitalized
	in the three months ended September 30, 2016.

	with ASC 360-10 “

	Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”.


	 


	The Company reviews assets
	for evidence of impairment annually at year-end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may
	not be recoverable. The impairment review requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash
	flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry
	or market conditions, changes in business operations and changes in competition.

	into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates. These affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based
	on a percentage of the Company’s revenue or based on a certain metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks.


	 


	TAC expense is recorded in cost of revenue.



	 




	Share-Based Compensation



	 


	The Company recognizes
	share-based compensation costs for all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options,
	restricted stock awards, and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, over the requisite service period
	based on their relative fair values. We estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
	option valuation model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility are based on the actual volatility of our publicly traded
	stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve
	in effect at the time of the grant. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise activity. The value of the
	portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements
	of Operations over the requisite service periods. In the first quarter of 2015, all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered,
	therefore there was no share-based compensation expense in the three or Nine Months ended September 30, 2016. Share-based compensation
	expense, related to stock option grants and employee stock purchases, recognized were zero for the three months ended September
	30, 2016, and were not significant for the three months ended September 30, 2015.


	 


	Forfeitures are estimated
	at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is determined
	at the end of each fiscal quarter, based on historical rates.


	 


	The Company elected to
	adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation to establish the beginning
	balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation,
	and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee
	share-based compensation awards.



	 




	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as
	incurred and were insignificant and $0.01 in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016. Advertising costs were insignificant
	and $0.01 in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2015, respectively


	 



	Product Development
	Costs



	 


	Research of new product ideas and enhancements
	to existing products are charged to expense as incurred.



	 




	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for
	income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
	the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
	year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
	assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The Company records liabilities, where appropriate, for all uncertain income tax
	positions. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations
	as income tax expense.



	 




	Comprehensive Loss



	 


	Other comprehensive loss
	as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
	available-for-sale and foreign currency translation adjustments.

	Net Loss per Common Share



	 


	Basic net loss per share
	is calculated using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, excluding treasury stock. Diluted net loss per share
	is calculated using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding, excluding treasury
	stock, during the period, using the treasury stock method for stock options. As a result of the Company’s net loss position
	at both September 30, 2016 and 2015, there is no dilution.



	 




	Segment Information



	 


	The Company has one operating
	segment, online advertising. While the Company operates under one operating segment, management reviews revenue under two product
	offerings—Advertiser Networks and Publisher Solutions.


	 


	As of September 30, 2016
	and December 31, 2015, the Company’s accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the online advertising
	segment. All long-lived assets are located in the United States and Canada.



	 




	Adoption of New Accounting Standards



	 


	On January 2, 2014 we
	adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), ASU 2013-04, “

	Liabilities –
	Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the
	Reporting Date

	”, an amendment providing guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting
	from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. Adoption
	of this new guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.


	 


	On January 2, 2015, we
	adopted the guidance issued by the FASB, ASU 2015-08, “

	Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property,
	Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360):

	 

	Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an
	Entity.

	" ASU 2015-08 raised the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures
	of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Adoption
	of this new guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In May 2014, the FASB
	issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-09 (“ASU 2015-09”) "

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	."
	ASU 2015-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities
	to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
	which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-09 is effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted.
	We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-09 on our consolidated financial statements.


	 



	2. Merger/Spin-off
	Reorganization Transaction



	 



	The Transaction



	 


	On
	April 23, 2015, LookSmart, Ltd. (the “Predecessor”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
	Agreement”) by and among the Company; LookSmart Group, (the “Company”) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecesssor
	; Pyxis Tankers Inc. (“Pyxis”); and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxis (“Merger Sub”). If the transactions
	contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which are subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company at a special meeting (the
	“Meeting”) of the Company, are completed:



	 








	·



	The Company will further amend its Amended Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock
	split (the “Reverse Split”) of its issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-two and
	not more than one-for-ten, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Predecessor’s board of directors in its sole discretion;




	 







	·



	All of the business, assets and liabilities of the Predecessor will have been transferred to Company,
	and holders of record of the Predecessor’s common stock will receive a pro rata distribution of one share of Company’s
	common stock for each share of the Predecessor’s common stock held as of the record date set for said distribution (the “Spin-Off”);




	 







	·



	The Predecessor will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger and being
	a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxis (the “Merger”); and




	 





	14

	 





	 




	  







	·



	Each share of the Predecessor’s common stock held by holders of record at the close of business
	on the date of the closing of the Merger will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive the number of share(s) of Pyxis
	common stock equal to $4,000,000 divided by a denominator equal to (i) the final closing price of a share of the Predecessor’s
	common stock (post-Reverse Split) on the date of the closing of the Merger, multiplied by (ii) the number of issued and outstanding
	shares of the Predecessor’s common stock (post-Reverse Split) as of the date that the Merger becomes effective.




	   


	In addition, the Predecessor
	and Pyxis have each agreed to take such actions as are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and have made certain
	other customary covenants in the Merger Agreement. Among other things, the Predecessor has agreed to the preparation and filing
	by Pyxis of a registration statement on Form F-4 in connection with the registration of the Pyxis’ common stock to be issued
	as result of the Merger, which registration statement will contain a joint proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the stockholders
	of the Predecessor.


	 


	The joint proxy statement/prospectus
	for the shareholder vote on the Merger has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and
	the Staff of the SEC has returned comments thereon to the Predecessor and Pyxis, which are preparing responses to these comments.
	A special meeting of the Predecessor’s shareholders to vote on the Merger transactions was held on October 26

	th

	,
	2015.


	 


	As
	a result of the Merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Pyxis is expected to become a public company.
	Pyxis intends to apply to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE MKT under the symbol “PXS.”


	 


	For additional information
	regarding Pyxis and the Merger transaction, see the Predecessor’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 23, 2015.


	 




	Pyxis
	Tankers Inc.






	 




	Pyxis Tankers Inc. is
	a newly formed international maritime transportation company with a focus on the tanker sector. At the consummation of the Merger
	with the Predecessor, Pyxis’ fleet will be comprised of six double hull product tankers with an average current age of four
	years and that are employed under a mix of short- and medium-term time charters and spot charters. Pyxis will acquire these six
	vessels prior to the Merger from an affiliate of its founder and chief executive officer, Mr. Valentis (“Eddie”) Valentis.
	Four of the vessels in the fleet will be medium-range, or MR, product tankers, three of which have eco-efficient or eco-modified
	designs and two will be short-range tanker sister ships. Each of the vessels in the fleet is capable of transporting refined petroleum
	products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, such as vegetable
	oils and organic chemicals.


	 



	Spin-Off




	 



	Prior
	to the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company
	in anticipation of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and
	the liabilities of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries, and has agreed to indemnify Pyxis for losses relating to all of
	the liabilities of the Predecessor and its former subsidiaries.


	 


	Upon
	completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s shares of the common stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100%
	owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record as of the record date set for said distribution.


	 



	The Make Whole
	Record Date



	 


	In
	the event that subsequent to the Merger, Pyxis completes a financing which results in gross proceeds to Pyxis of at least $5,000,000
	(a “

	Future Pyxis Offering

	”) at a valuation lower than the valuation ascribed to the shares of common stock received
	by the Predecessor’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “

	Consideration Value

	”), Pyxis
	will be obligated to make “whole” the Predecessor’s stockholders as of April 29, 2015 (the “

	Make Whole
	Record Date

	”) by offering the Predecessor’s stockholders the right to receive additional shares of Pyxis common
	stock to compensate the Predecessor’s stockholders for the difference in value of their Pyxis common stock.


	 


	In
	addition, should Pyxis fail to complete a Future Pyxis Offering within a date which is 3 years from the date of the closing of
	the Merger, each holder of the Predecessor’s common stock who has held such stock continuously from the date of the Make
	Whole Record Date until the expiration of such 3 year period (the “

	Legacy LS Stockholders

	”) will have a 24-hour
	option beginning at the end of the 3 year period to require Pyxis to purchase from such Legacy LS Stockholders a pro rata amount
	of Pyxis common stock that would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Legacy LS Stockholders in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000;
	provided that in no event shall a Legacy LS Stockholder receive an amount per share greater than the Consideration Value.

	Voting Agreement



	 


	In
	connection with their entry into the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor, Pyxis and Michael Onghai, entered into a voting agreement,
	which is referred to herein as the “

	Voting Agreement

	.” The Voting Agreement generally requires that Mr. Onghai,
	in his capacity as a stockholder of the Predecessor, vote all of his shares of the Predecessor’s common stock in favor of
	the reverse split proposal, the spin-off proposal and the merger proposal, unless doing so would violate his fiduciary duties as
	an executive officer and member of the board of directors of the Company. Mr. Onghai beneficially holds 3,123,047 shares of the
	Predecessor’s common stock, representing approximately 54.1% of the outstanding shares of the Predecssor’s common stock
	over which he possesses voting rights and are therefore subject to the Voting Agreement.



	 




	Closing



	 


	The Predecessor completed
	the Transaction with Pyxis on October 28

	th

	 2015.


	 


	Prior
	to the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Predecessor transferred all of its businesses, assets and liabilities to the Company
	in anticipation of the Spin-Off of Company from the Predecessor. The Company has assumed all liabilities of the Predecessor, and
	the liabilities of the Predecessor’s former subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Spin-Off, all of the Predecessor’s
	shares of the common stock shall be cancelled and Company shall be 100% owned by the Predecessor’s stockholders of record
	as of the record date set for said distribution. As a result of the Spin-off, each share of the Predecessor received one share
	of LookSmart Group common stock. Following the merger, LookSmart Group had a total of 5,768,851 shares of common stock issued and
	outstanding. The Company is in the process of applying to be traded in the OTC Markets or the Pinksheets.


	 


	In
	addition, in connection with the reverse merger with Pyxis, the Predecessor consummated a 1 to .1512 reverse split, thereby reducing
	the number of its shares outstanding from 5,768,851 to 872,036. Each post-split share of the Predecessor was cancelled and exchanged
	for the right to receive 1.0667 shares of Pyxis common stock. Following the reverse merger, Pyxis had a total of 18,244,671 shares
	(giving effect to rounding up on fractional shares) of common stock issued and outstanding.

	The contractual maturities

	The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its
	policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary
	impairment, the Company reviews such factors as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
	financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required
	to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis. During the three months ended September
	30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on outstanding investments. As of September 30, 2016, the
	Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

	Letters of Credit



	 


	The company had an outstanding
	standby letter of credit issued by City National Bank (CNB) of approximately $0.1 million at December 30, 2014, related to security
	of the subleased corporate office lease and secured by a money market account held at CNB. In February 2015, the Company cancelled
	this letter of credit upon release by the Lessor.



	 




	Guarantees and Indemnities



	 


	During its normal course
	of business, the Company has made certain guarantees, indemnities and commitments under which it may be required to make payments
	in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to the Company’s
	customers and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of its products, and indemnities to various lessors in
	connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease.



	 




	Officer and Director Indemnification



	 


	The Company has agreements
	whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving,
	at the Company’s request, in such capacity, to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
	maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
	However, the Company maintains directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute, up to certain limits, a portion of
	any future amounts paid, for indemnification of directors and officers. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these
	indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. Historically, the Company has not incurred any
	losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities.



	 




	Legal Proceedings




	 



	The Company is otherwise
	involved, from time to time, in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although
	the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters
	to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise.
	However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations,
	cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company
	because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

	Stock Option Plans



	 


	In December 1997, the
	Company approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan (the “1998 Plan”). In June 2007, the stockholders approved the LookSmart
	2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Under the 2007 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified
	stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock rights to employees, directors and consultants. Share-based incentive awards
	are provided under the terms of these two plans (collectively, the “Plans”).


	 


	The Compensation Committee
	of the Board of Directors administers the Company’s Plans. Awards under the Plans principally include at-the-money options
	and fully vested restricted stock. Outstanding stock options generally become exercisable over a four-year period from the grant
	date and have a term of seven years. Grants can only be made under the 2007 Plan. The 1998 Plan is closed to further share issuance
	and all options have expired or been forfeited as of March 31, 2015. The number of shares issued or reserved for issuance under
	the 2007 Plan was 1.2 million and 1.4 million shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

	changes with changes in the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

	Employee Stock Purchase Plan



	 


	On July 14, 2009,
	the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) was approved by the shareholders and authorized to issue up to 500 thousand
	shares of Common Stock to employees. Substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll
	deductions at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or end of the offering period. Each offering and
	purchase period is Nine Months. ESPP contributions are limited to a maximum of 15% of an employee’s eligible compensation,
	and ESPP participants are limited to purchasing a maximum of 5,000 shares per purchase period. On February 15, 2013, the ESPP was
	suspended pending a review by the Company’s Board of Directors of all equity incentive arrangements. Share-based compensation
	expense for the ESPP was zero in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and insignificant in the three months ended March 31,
	2015. As of September 30, 2016, 28 thousand shares (adjusted for the 3:1 reverse split in November 2013) have been issued
	under the 2009 Plan. In the first quarter of 2015, all remaining outstanding share options were surrendered,



	 




	Share-Based Compensation Valuation Assumptions



	 


	We estimate the fair value
	of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility
	are based on the actual volatility of our publically traded stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual
	life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. We estimate the expected term based
	upon the historical exercise activity.


	 


	No options were granted
	in the first Nine Months of 2016 or 2015, therefore no weighted average assumptions are included here.


	 


	Share-based compensation
	expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced
	for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from those estimates.



	 




	Exercise of Employee and Director Stock Options and Purchase
	Plans



	 


	There were no options
	exercised in the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise
	of stock options. No income tax benefits have been realized from exercised stock options.



	 




	Repurchase of Equity Securities by the Company



	 


	There were no shares repurchased
	during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Approximately 98,000 shares were purchased at an average price of $1.78 per share
	under the program in the year ended December 31, 2014, and recorded as Treasury Stock at cost totaling approximately $0.17 million.

	Additional Paid-in Capital




	 



	Paid-in Capital increased
	by $0.6 million. This increase is due to the $0.6 million the Predecessor received from privately-held Pyxis Tankers Inc. (“Pyxis”)
	associated with the announcement in April 2015 that LookSmart, Ltd. (the “Predecessor”) and privately-held Pyxis Tankers
	Inc. ("Pyxis") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby Pyxis will become
	a publicly listed company as a result of the merger between LookSmart, Ltd. ("Predecessor") and into Pyxis' wholly-owned
	subsidiary, Maritime Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation. On the effective date of the merger, in addition, LookSmart will
	spin off its existing business into a new entity called LookSmart Group, Inc. (“LookSmart” or "Company").

	Investments



	 


	For investments that have
	quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the
	amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized
	pricing service (“pricing service”). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service
	to determine a single estimate of fair value, which is mainly for its fixed maturity investments. The fair value estimates provided
	from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company bases all of its estimates
	of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an
	arm’s length transaction.


	 


	The Company validates
	the prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, applicability of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
	or other national government insurance or guarantees, comparison of proceeds received on individual investments subsequent to reporting
	date, prices received from publicly available sources, and review of transaction volume data to confirm the presence of active
	markets. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the pricing service unless such prices are determined to be inconsistent.
	At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not adjust prices received from the pricing service.

	The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value and is net of allowances for doubtful
	accounts and returns which estimate customer non-performance risk.



	 




	Trade accounts payable
	and accrued liabilities:

	The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these items approximates their
	fair value, which is the likely amount that the liability with short settlement periods would be transferred to a market participant
	with a similar credit standing as the Company.

	The following discussion
	should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those statements, which appear
	elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
	of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We
	use words such as “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
	“may,” “will” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Discussions containing forward-looking
	statements may be found in the material set forth under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations” and in other sections of this report. All forward-looking statements, including, but not limited
	to, projections, expectations or estimates concerning our business, including demand for our products and services, mix of revenue
	sources, ability to control and/or reduce operating expenses, anticipated gross margins and operating results, cost savings, product
	development efforts, general outlook of our business and industry, future profits or losses, competitive position, share-based
	compensation, adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our other cash requirements, are inherently uncertain as they
	are based on our expectations and assumptions concerning future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
	known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual
	results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including but not limited
	to, the possibility that we may fail to maintain or grow our listings advertiser base and/or distribution network, that existing
	and potential distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable
	products or pricing terms, that we may be unable to grow our online search advertising revenue and/or find alternative sources
	of revenue, that we may be unable to attain or maintain customer acceptance of our publisher solutions products, that changes in
	the distribution network composition may lead to decreases in query volumes, that we may be unable to maintain or improve our query
	volume, match rate, number of paid clicks, average revenue per click, conversion rate or other ad network metrics, that we may
	be unable to achieve or maintain profitability, that we may be unable to retain our existing credit facilities or obtain new credit
	facilities, that we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses,
	that we may be unable to remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or that one or more of the other risks described elsewhere in
	this report may occur.



	 


	All forward-looking statements
	in this report are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and except as required
	by applicable law; we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	The discussion and analysis
	of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
	requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
	related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates.
	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
	the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical
	accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September
	30, 2016, there had been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.

	The decrease in Advertiser
	Networks revenue for the three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 is the result of
	a reduction in revenues from all categories: Intermediaries, Direct Advertisers and Self Service Advertisers. We experienced a
	continuing decrease in Advertising Network revenue in the Nine Months of 2016 following a trend that began in late 2011.


	 


	In the Nine Months of
	2016, revenue from Intermediaries decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.

	2016, revenue from Direct Advertisers decreased compared to the Nine Months of 2015.

	At September 30, 2016,
	we had approximately $0.27 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments. Cash equivalents and short-term
	marketable investments are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government, commercial paper, time deposits,
	money market mutual funds, U.S. corporate securities, collateralized debt obligations and other commodities. We actively monitor
	the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and the institutions of whose debt instruments we hold. Our
	investment policy, which is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors, primarily emphasizes safety of principal while secondarily
	on maximizing yield on those funds. We can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not
	be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. These balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
	insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these
	cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in
	the financial markets. See Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, “Cash and Available for Sale Securities,”
	which describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.


	 


	Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term
	investments increased $0.03 million to $0.27 million at September 30, 2016, from $0.24 million at December 31, 2015, primarily
	due to financing activities, offset by operating losses. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we generated a minimal positive
	cash flow from operations.


	 


	Our primary source of
	liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our current primary use of cash is to fund operating losses
	and investment in software development. . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services
	beyond the current quarter, and changes in customer buying behavior. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets continue
	to remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely
	affected. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to
	fund our operations and capital expenditures, take advantage of favorable business opportunities, develop and upgrade our technology
	infrastructure, develop new product and service offerings, take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond
	to competitive pressures. In addition, unanticipated developments in the short term requiring cash payments, including the acquisition
	of businesses with negative cash flows, may necessitate additional financing. We cannot be assured that additional financing will
	be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders
	may experience substantial dilution.

	Cash used in operating activities in the Nine
	Months ended September 30, 2016, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization,
	provision for doubtful accounts, and share-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and
	other activities. Cash used in operations in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.386 million and consisted of a net
	loss of $1.071 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.631 million and cash generated by working capital and other activities
	of $0.08 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.682 million of depreciation and amortization expense
	on property and equipment, $0.008 amortization of deferred rent, and $0.043 million in other non-cash charges. In addition, changes
	in working capital activities primarily consisted of a $0.326 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	a decrease of $0.249 million in accounts receivable and a $0.009 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The decrease in
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to decreased TAC and operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable
	is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.


	 


	Cash used in operating activities in the nine
	months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization,

	30, 2015 was $2.0 million and consisted of a net loss of $2.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $0.6 million and cash
	used by working capital and other activities of zero. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $0.8 million of depreciation
	and amortization expense on property and equipment and purchased software. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily
	consisted of a $0.3 million net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $0.11 million in accounts receivable
	and a $0.22 million decrease in prepaid and other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily
	due to the increase in operating expenses. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributed to slower paying customers.


	 



	Investing Activities



	 


	Cash provided by investing
	activities in the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 was zero.


	 


	Cash used in investing activities in the nine
	months ended September 30, 2015 of $0.3 million was attributed to $0.4 million purchase of intangible assets partially offset by
	$0.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 


	Cash provided by financing
	activities in the Nine Months of 2016 of $0.43 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities from Snowy
	August Management, LLC. (See Other Obligations)


	 


	Cash provided by financing activities in the
	first nine months of 2015 of $2.1 million is primarily attributed to increases in long-term liabilities and notes payable, as well
	as proceeds from additional paid-in capital.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance
	sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4), investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings
	or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.



	 




	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments



	 


	In comparison with our
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that there have been no material changes in contractual
	obligations or commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business, during the three months ended September 30, 2016.




	 








	ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK



	 


	Pursuant to Section 229.305(e)
	of Regulation S-K, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information regarding quantitative and qualitative
	disclosures about market risk.

	ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Our management, with the
	participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure
	controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”),
	as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on From 10-Q.


	 


	In designing and evaluating
	our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
	operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
	controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
	judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.


	 


	Based on this evaluation,
	our chief executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
	controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
	information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules and
	forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal
	financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes
	in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	ITEM 1.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	The Company is otherwise
	involved, from time to time, in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. Although
	the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect resolution of these matters
	to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position unless stated otherwise.
	However, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could, depending on its amount and timing, materially affect its results of operations,
	cash flows or financial position in a future period. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company
	because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Michael Onghai, President and Chief Executive Officer of LookSmart, Ltd. (Nasdaq:   LOOK), said today that he is very pleased to announce the shareholders of LookSmart, Ltd., at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders held the morning of October 26, 2015, overwhelmingly approved the following resolutions:  

To effect a reverse split of LookSmart, Ltd.'s outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-two and not more than one-for-ten at any time prior to November 30, 2015, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range, as determined by LookSmart, Ltd.'s board of directors in its sole discretion. 
To adopt a spin-off of LookSmart, Ltd.'s business, assets and liabilities into LookSmart Group, Inc. 
To adopt an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Pyxis Tankers Inc., Maritime Technologies Corp., LookSmart, Ltd. and LookSmart Group, Inc., and to approve the transactions contemplated by such agreement.
About LookSmart, Ltd.
LookSmart, Ltd. was organized in 1996 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware. LookSmart, Ltd. is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display advertising customers, organized along five lines of business: (i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches. In addition, LookSmart, Ltd. formed a partnership with Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, which supports the company's other lines of business through the creation of content sites directed at ecommerce verticals. The company operates its partnership and each line of business, while being related to the others in terms of shared resources, as separate business lines with their own core management, profits and losses, and the ability to operate independently as separate businesses. As a result, this separation of business lines allows Looksmart, Ltd. to operate effectively as a holding company and as a capital allocator to each of the company's separate businesses with the goal of finding mispriced assets in the public and private markets and subsequently taking those assets to create scalable and sustainable businesses that may then be monetized for the ultimate benefit of Looksmart, Ltd.'s stockholders.
