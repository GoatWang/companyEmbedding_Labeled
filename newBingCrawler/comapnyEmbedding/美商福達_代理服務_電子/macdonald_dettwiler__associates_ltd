Abstract:

 MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd (C) is the third part of a three-part case.  The director and chair of the governance committee at MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd (MDA) reflects upon the past two-and-a-half months. He and other members of the board of directors faced difficult decisions but were pleased to see that their decisions had almost unanimous support from stockholders. As he read the business section of the newspaper, he wondered whether the decisions had been considered carefully with all the stakeholders in mind.
