Why my account is limited to only few analytic runs? 

								To execute equity pricing pattern simulations, real time valuations, recommendations, instant reporting, and portfolio analytics such as mean-variance optimization takes huge amount of 
								computing resources. Since we are a small company we cannot afford to have
								hundreds of servers in our cluster. To be fair to all of our users with free accounts, 
								we have restricted analytics execution to few times.  Please upgrade 
								your account to be able to remove usage restrictions and unlock all the features and tools used by professional money mangers.
								
I don't want to upgrade at this time. Are there any other options? 
	
								Yes, just show us your support and love and we will temporary re-enable the content. 
								To instantly unlock the content for few additional page views, use one of the social buttons below. 
								We thank you for your continued support and appreciate your loyalty as we try to make this service accessible and affordable to all investors.

THE WORLD OF DIADROM
Diadrom is an expert consultancy company with a focus on Diagnostics of products with embedded software. The company was founded in 1999 and has a majority of the customer base in the automotive sector. Other customer sectors include industrial machinery, defence, security and public transport. Diadrom is traded on NASDAQ OMX First North (ticker DIAH).
Diadrom are delivering solutions to our customers with in the areas of:


Diagnostic & R&DThe Diadrom offer within R&D is focused on the development and verification of embedded software systems that is a part of the product itself (e.g., a passenger car).


Diagnostic & Manufacturing
Diagnostics is also an important part in the manufacturing of products with embedded software. Diadroms offer is to make sure that the factory produce a product that matches the customer order, is working properly and that the manufacturing process is conducted in a safe and efficient way.



Diagnostic & Aftermarket
For most durable product the up-front sales margin has decreased in recent years. Besides the brand and identity aspects of the product, the actual features are quite similar between products (c.f., passenger cars). Accordingly, the battleground for the customers is on the aftermarket, both on earnings (spare parts and service), ease of ownership and uptime. 

×Diagnostic and R&D
The Diadrom offer within R&D is focused on the development and verification of embedded software systems that is a part of the product itself (e.g., a passenger car). The embedded software is spread out in a network of computers (often called ECUs) with a responsibly for physical modules such as engine (ECM) and gearbox (TCM). The network communication between modules has enabled an explosion of software based cross module functions, e.g., adaptive cruise control.
The main contribution by Diadrom is the “base tech” which is the basic features of diagnostics (i.e., configuration, software download, calibration, fault tracing and logging). Up until recently, the command and control software has been developed by the OEM or dominating Tier one suppliers. However, as the complexity and need for development speed is ever increasing, Diadrom is seeing new opportunities to meet the demand increase.
An example of this from the year 2015 was the project to produce a Parking assistance camera with LG Innotek for the car maker CEVT (see Customer case LG for details). This sort of safety critical system needs rigid software process control and verification procedures.Close×Diadrom and Manufacturing
Diagnostics is also an important part in the manufacturing of products with embedded software. The factory must make sure that the produced product matches the customer order, is working properly, and that the manufacturing process is conducted in a safe and efficient way.
A bill-of-material for a vehicle contains a large set of software and ECU parts. Several setting (calibrations) that a unique to the individual vehicle, is created in the factory, and they will be maintained its entire life time.
A Diadrom example of business in manufacturing is the development of the system PROSIT+ for the Volvo Group. The system is used in over 60 factories, across the globe, with large variety of manufactured units and variant complexity.Close×Diagnostic and Aftermarket
For most durable product the up-front sales margin has decreased in recent years. Besides the brand and identity aspects of the product, the actual features are quite similar between products (c.f., passenger cars). Accordingly, the battleground for the customers is on the aftermarket, both on earnings (spare parts and service), ease of ownership and uptime.
Diadrom is at the centre of this development with several ongoing assignments on the area. However, the Life Cycle Management Systems (LCMS) needs to cover all existing situations and accordingly a diagnostic system used by a mechanic in the repair shop is where a vast majority of the work is done. Diadrom is a considerable supplier for almost all Swedish automotive companies in the aftermarket area.CloseOUR CUSTOMER CASES
