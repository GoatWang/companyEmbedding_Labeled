History[edit]
Semcon was founded in 1980 in Västerås by Arvid Hansen. In1983, Hansen also started operations in Gothenburg and, in 1985, the head office was moved to Gothenburg. In 1990, Semcon was sold to VIAK. VIAK was then sold to VBB Group. After a management buy out, Semcon was introduced to the Swedish Stock Exchange in 1997. A rapid growth and expansion in Sweden took place.
In the beginning of 2000, Semcon started a series of sub brands such as Zipper, Zuite, Zystems, Zooma, Zingle, Zetup with a focus on IT. (called the Z-companies) Pentech in the UK was acquired in 2005 and this was the first Semcon operation outside Sweden. In 2005, the first office in China was opened and soon one in Hungary. Two larger acquisitions took place in 2007: German IVM Automotive, and Swedish Caran. With IVM Automotive, Semcon now also had operations in Brazil, India and Germany. The Z-companies were sold except Zooma.

Sonic Movement[edit]
Main article: Sonic Movement
Sonic Movement is a research project operated by Semcon.[9] Premiered in September 2013,[10] Sonic Movement proposes creating a new "adaptive" system of warning sounds and noises for electric cars,[10] which is in opposition to another industry trend of replicating combustion engine noises for electric car sound effects.[11]
Founders James Brooks and Fernando Ocaña are on the design team, as well as artists Holly Herndon and Matt Dryhurst.[12] The project aims to meet a proposal for a US mandate which would require all quiet electric vehicles to emit warning sounds,[10] as well as legislation passed by the European parliament in April 2014, which states that all new electric cars sold in the EU had to emit noise by 2019.[13] However, Ocaña notes that while legislators are "looking at this from a technical point of view, [Sonic Movement is] looking at it from a user experience point of view."[14]

Semcon has acquired the business in the Norwegian company ibruk AS, active in the area of product information. Through the acquisition, Semcon will expand its presence to also include the Norwegian market.

Sales for 2013 totalled NOK 23.9 million. The acquisition comes into effect on 1 September 2014.

“ibruk is well positioned on the Norwegian market, especially in the oil and gas industry, and we have the possibility of further building and expanding our business with new and existing customers,” says Johan Ekener, President of Semcon’s Product Information business area. “To the services that ibruk has supplied for a long time on the Norwegian market can now be added Semcon’s entire offer, experience and strength as an international company.”

“Semcon’s extensive expertise was one of the reasons for choosing Semcon and I am now really looking forward to introducing an extended offer to the Norwegian market,” says Stein Tore Johnsen, founder and seller of ibruk and responsible for Semcon Norway AS. “I am confident that our combined knowledge and skills can change the way companies in Norway handle their documentation and training.”

For several years Semcon has supported customers on the Norwegian market, both with engineering services and product information offerings from the Swedish organization. With this acquisition Semcon now has a platform in Norway to offer its wide range of services to the Norwegian market.   “As we expand into Norway, it will bring new opportunities that will make Semcon an even more international service provider,” concludes Johan Ekener.

Semcon acquires German product information company
Tue, Oct 02, 2012 09:00 CET

Semcon has acquired the shares in the Comet group of companies in Germany (Comet), active within the area of product information. Through the acquisition, Semcon expands its offer on the German market to include solutions and services within product information. The acquisition of Comet complements Semcon’s existing business in Germany, which today includes around 1,000 people in the engineering services area. 

Semcon has acquired the shares in Comet Computer GmbH and Comet Communication GmbH, a Munich-based group of companies in the product information sector. The companies have more than 25 years’ of experience in technical documentation and training for the German information and communication technology industry. Today, Comet has over 40 employees and turnover for 2011 totalled EUR 2.4 million with an EBIT of EUR -0.2 million. The acquisition is expected to have a marginal effect on earnings per share in 2013. The acquisition came into effect on 1 October 2012. 

Through the acquisition, Semcon’s business area for solutions and services in product information (Informatic) will expand its presence to also include the German market. 

 “We can now bring Semcon’s strong offer and track record in product information solutions and services to the German market and use Comet as a platform for rapid growth in Germany,” says Johan Ekener, president of business area Informatic. “In addition, Semcon’s existing partnerships with German customers within engineering services provide an excellent basis for also expanding product information business in Germany.”

 “I am very excited about this next step for Comet” says Professor Sissi Closs, founder and one of Comet’s sellers. “It will be very good both for our customers and employees – who will both benefit from Semcon being a strong international partner and a growing environment.” 

“Comet has an excellent reputation on the German market. Comet is well-known for its knowledgeable employees and top-quality deliveries, which fit well with Semcon’s priorities and core values,” concludes Johan Ekener.
