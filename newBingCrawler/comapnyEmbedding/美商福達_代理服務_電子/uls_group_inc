Laser processing of Noryl™ can be performed with either a 9.3 or 10.6 micron CO2 laser and a 1.06 micron fiber laser. Laser cutting of Noryl™ with a CO2 laser results in a clean cut with some melt back. Laser engraving of Noryl™ can be performed with a CO2 laser and results in depth with limited melt-back at the point of ablation. Laser marking of Noryl™ with a 1.06 micron fiber laser produces an indelible surface mark of high contrast that can be either light or darker depending upon the formulation of the substrate.Applicable Laser Processes for Noryl™Laser CuttingLaser MarkingLaser EngravingMaterials LibraryCompositesElastomersFoamsGlass & CeramicsMetalsNatural (Inorganic) MaterialsNatural (Organic)Paper BasedPlasticsTextiles & FabricsContact UsBuild Your Laser SystemFind a ULS Representative
