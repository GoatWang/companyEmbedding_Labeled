NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION
The Model 201 Lens Cradle casting is a lightweight and safer alternative to iron castings. "The Cradle" is made from polycarbonate plastic and features a replaceable C40 Lens inside the casting bed. The casting is placed in a recessed cutout that allows the marker lens and casting to rest below the road surface.
THE SKY IS THE LIMIT
AirMark® is a durable pavement marking for airfields made of preformed thermoplastic. It is the ultimate solution for adding clarity and distinction to enhanced markings to be seen from the sky above or on the ground below.
REDEFINE THE ROAD
HPS-8 Integrated Multipolymer is unique binder system made up of multiple polymers, giving it high durability, long-term retroreflectivity and fast cure. All while being applied by standard thermoplastic equipment.
VISIBILITY GOES GREEN
Green Bike Lanes improve visibility and safety for all shared roadway users. That’s why the use of colorized bike lanes is on the rise in North America as they enhance municipal infrastructure and produce positive results.

Government
Governments around the world have recognized the importance of clearly visible pavement markings and retroreflectivity in reducing traffic accidents and improving road safety. For city planners, traffic engineers, public works, and others with the responsibility of selecting and maintaining pavement markings, incorporating durable traffic safety solutions that cost-effectively address their long-term design and growth plans are an important step towards creating adaptable and vibrant communities.

Commercial
A January 16, 2007 ruling by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requires any road traveled by the public to comply with federal traffic marking and signage standards. This includes private roads near commercial buildings and parking lots near private enterprises. But the needs of property managers go beyond meeting FHWA-mandated regulations regarding markings that properly direct and manage traffic. Whether at shopping centers, restaurants, office parks, industrial facilities or any privately-owned space, commercial pavement markings should direct traffic while contributing to the site’s overall aesthetic appeal.

Airports
For pilots, ground crews, maintenance and traffic management personnel, highly visible, easy-to-understand markings that can be read and seen at any time of day or night are critical to the safe operation of any airport. Exposure to temperature and weather extremes as well as constant wear means the paints, plural components and preformed thermoplastics used for marking your runways and taxiways have to be especially resilient.

Why Ennis-Flint?
The way society moves through the world should be an afterthought. When it comes to roads, interchanges, airports, hospitals, schools and any other place along our routes in life—we don’t always think about how they are constructed or the science behind how they work—we just expect them to. That means every country, government, contractor, architect and engineer needs the right tools at their disposal to make sure the communities under their watch are protected by high-quality, well thought out infrastructure that keeps them safe and the world running smoothly. That’s why every Ennis-Flint product and application is designed for quality -- quality that ensures safety, reliability and clarity no matter the project.
