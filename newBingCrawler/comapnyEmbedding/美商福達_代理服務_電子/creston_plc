Media Company Research Reports


Companies in the Media (or ‘mass media’) industry are involved in multiple activities in the areas such as broadcast media (radio and TV), publishing (printing), recordings (audio cassettes, CDs, DVDs, etc.), movies, digital media (the Net and cellular phones), and others, aimed at reaching the majority of mass audience.
The Media world witnessed formidable growth throughout the former ten years thanks to the technology breakthroughs in the broadcasting and printing sectors, evoked by the elevated significance of modifying media usage patterns. By end-2017, the market is anticipated to crawl to a world value of nearly EUR 958 billion. North America, steered by the U.S., is the globe’s largest, though a slow-growing, marketplace. The global media space is chaired by such giants as Comcast Corporation, Time Warner, News Corporation, Google, and Walt Disney.

Creston Unlimited
Addressing our clients’ evolving brand and business challenges



We are Unlimited
Over the last decade, we’ve seen unprecedented change in marketing communications and business transformation. Digital, data and technology have been the key game changers.
Whilst this change has opened up unlimited opportunities, it has also resulted in an ever-changing and often challenging landscape for businesses and brands. In parallel, the siloed marketing disciplines, media channels and business processes of the past no longer engage today’s consumers as effectively as they once did.
For clients, the ability to draw upon thought leadership and multidiscipline expertise to navigate this change is vital to achieving sustainable growth. That’s why we’ve created Unlimited.


We are Unlimited
With Unlimited Thinking at its core, the Group brings together a unique blend of discipline experts from across the specialist companies and partners within Creston.
We embrace the power of creative collaboration to solve the big strategic brand and communication issues that our clients face.

Consultancy
Unlimited provides consultancy services at the highest levels of clients’ businesses, helping them with strategic thinking to address their product, marketing, technology and innovation challenges and realise opportunities.
We’re passionate in our drive to create solutions that enhance interaction between consumer and business, placing people front and centre of all engagements.
Rather than concentrating on specific sectors, we’re driven by business challenges, finding common themes across multiple industries that allow us to create consistently innovative but usable business solutions.


Communications
We collaborate closely with our clients to develop engaging brand experiences – disruptive ideas that capture the imagination and create discernible changes in behaviour.
Our integrated communications deliver effective and measurable results that impact directly on our clients’ bottom lines.
In addition, our insight and research companies deliver thorough understanding of customer and user sentiment. This, combined with our trend forecasting capabilities and profound understanding of consumer decision-making through neuroscience, can create and accelerate brand momentum for our clients.


Health & wellbeing
We draw on the brightest talent from across our industry to deliver the most creative, innovative and effective answers to healthcare brand and business challenges.
Through the best combination of public relations, advertising, brand ideation, planning, medical education, digital, and social media, we unlock the power of creative collaboration to drive competitive advantage and growth for clients.
We deliver clear audience insights to innovative executions with meaningful and measurable outcomes.

Spanning integrated digital, brand and consultancy services, our diverse and complementary teams deliver award-winning work for clients.

Lynx
A partnership between Lynx and charity CALM, the #BiggerIssues campaign used social listening to fuel a reactive campaign that held a mirror up to all the topics that were statistically ‘bigger’ than suicide. Pop-culture was juxtaposed with male suicide, conveying the scale of the issue to make guys take notice.

Freestyle Libre
For 415 million diabetes patients in the world, finger pricking is an unavoidable way to monitor their blood glucose every day. We helped introduce the Freestyle Libre system – ground-breaking technology that changes how people monitor their glucose levels and helps them live healthier lives.

House of Fraser
House of Fraser’s Christmas 2015 campaign, Your Christmas, Your Rules, broke tradition and generated record sales for the retailer. By 5 January 2016, a 5.3 per cent year-on-year uplift in sales saw HoF ahead of John Lewis for the second year running.

Jeep
Jeep tasked us with delivering a multi-channel campaign that would not only boost sales but also maximise the media noise around Black Friday. Standing true to the brand’s values, the campaign took a strong stance against conformity, stating: “It doesn’t have to be Black. And it doesn’t have to be Friday.”

As part of our campaign to launch The Walking Dead S6 on NOW TV, we brought to life a key storyline, creating Obfleshion, Eau de Walker, a pungent unisex fragrance designed to help fans ward off unwanted zombies.

As part of ongoing digital transformation work with major utility SSE, we launched the first phase of a new online customer engagement experience.

Chief Executive's review
Barrie Brien
Following the Group-wide rebrand, we have launched five start-ups, made two acquisitions and formed two partnerships delivering a further improved new business performance, growth in revenue, and an increased dividend to our shareholders.


Chief Executive's review
Overview

In the 12 months under review, the Group has achieved good progress in implementing its five year strategic plan, continued the growth in new business and broadened the services delivered to many of its top 20 clients, whilst reporting year-on-year growth in full year revenue, Headline PBIT and dividend.
The full year revenue increased 8 per cent against the prior year to £82.6 million (2015: £76.9 million), while like-for-like revenue was broadly flat at £76.5 million (2015: £76.9 million). Headline PBIT increased 1 per cent to £10.1 million (2015: £10.0 million), Headline PBT was flat at £9.9 million (2015: £9.9 million) and Headline Diluted EPS decreased to 12.02 pence (2015: 13.07 pence).

The Group has continued its history of reporting good cash conversion of its EBITDA and at 31 March 2016, following a cash conversion of 111 per cent in the year (2015: 80 per cent), the Group had net cash of £1.4 million (2015: £8.3 million) and no deferred consideration due (2015: £1.4 million). Following this operating cash flow performance, and the positive net cash position, the Board proposes a 5 per cent increase in the full year dividend to 4.4 pence per share (2015: 4.2 pence per share).




Chief Executive's review
Strategy

In FY15, we set out and began the implementation of a five-year strategy focusing on five key objectives, our ‘5x5s’, to create competitive advantage and growth for both our companies and our clients.
Our five key strategy objectives are to:

build an agency group brand
develop a Group full service client offer
develop our consultancy offer
invest in our existing companies’ offer and services
grow our international services.


Since launch, and more specifically in this year, I’m pleased to report we have made significant progress on the implementation of our new five year strategy. This progress has included the successful rebrand of the Group, filling the gaps in some discipline offerings and the addition of key strategic partners to the Unlimited family.
