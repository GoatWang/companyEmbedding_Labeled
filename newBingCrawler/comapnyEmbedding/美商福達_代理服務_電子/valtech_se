Product Thinking in Digital Automotive


1 années il y a



The term digital transformation has been omnipresent in the IT business ever since MIT Center for Digital Business and Capgemini published their first report on digital transformation in 2011. Digitalization has percolated through every social and economic area of our everyday existence.


Digital agencies, such as Valtech, have made it their mission to escort companies on this path of change – and therefore we offer services for all enterprise digital touch points. Our portfolio encompasses the entire range, from eCommerce and digital experience solutions to UX and service design to digital strategy consulting.
While digital transformation is dealing with changes in the value creation chain of the company, the Internet of Things (IoT) focuses on the networking of the physical products themselves. The idea behind the Internet of Things has been around for a while already and the term IoT itself was coined as early as the turn of the millennium by the Auto-ID Center of MIT. The more puzzling, however, is it that to date, no standardized IoT infrastructure across businesses has emerged.
Valtech has accumulated many years of solid experience in the area of networked vehicles. For more than 15 years, we have been accompanying the connect programs of various carmakers. As a strategic partner, we collaborate with one of the three biggest OEMs on its central backend platform for managing the connectivity of the vehicles with the outside world on a global level.  
What happens next? 
Digital change is on full throttle and even seems to be accelerating. More and more areas of application are being identified and the integration points of products with their outside world are steadily on the rise. Today, I expect that my car is able to couple with my smart phone to unlock it, to put a service call to the car repair shop of my choice and to help me to make an appointment, if  the need arises. I also want to be able to access my social media accounts while driving without being distracted too much. I’d also like for my car to show me the shortest way to a vacant parking spot and, ideally, reserve it for me. Furthermore, it should also inform me about accidents and danger points on my route.
The sky is the limit if it comes to imagining what else hybrid products (half physical, half digital) could be capable of! However, this also comes at a price! The complexity of it all is daunting and the use of the products, in particular their configuring, is often neither easy nor intuitive. As is well known, Apple responded to that problem with its Genius Bar rather early in the game. This successful concept was adopted by BMW with the introduction of its Product Genius in 2014.
The primary challenge, though, still remains: to design the products of the digital world to be easier and more intuitive to use. Service design, user design and product design should not be worked on separately – they need to mesh.
Ever since the Bauhaus design movement – dating from the first half of the 20th century – we have had here a long tradition of combining industrial products with an aesthetic, practical and timeless design derived from the intended purpose of the product. The ten tenets for good product design by Dieter Ram still hold true to this day, and can be applied to today’s hybrid products.
Today’s objective is to transfer these design principles into the digital world and think of solutions that are close to the product and serve their purpose. Good design is always simple.

The Future of Connected Cars
The automotive industry is currently going through some major disruptions. Cars are rapidly becoming more and more connected, autonomous and electrified. The traditional revenue distribution between manufacturers, suppliers, dealers and service providers is being challenged. At the same time the OEMs and tier ones are investing heavily in these areas and the voices of CFOs are becoming louder, questioning the return on investments.

The ever-faster pulse of social TV
Video is everywhere. In a blink of an eye, as 3G and 4G developed throughout the world, it escaped its consecrated districts – Youtube and good old TV – to colonize just about everything: our Facebook feeds, our tweets, our snaps, even our romantic lives through the now classic “Netflix &amp; Chill”.  If you have your doubts about this, ask your kids. Their lives are paced to the rhythm of Instagram, Snapchat, Periscope, Youtube or Twitch. When they’re not broadcasting their own lives, they’re avidly watching others’, from friends’ to total strangers’.

The value given to an end user is at the heart of all Valtech’s customer projects. One of our key differentiators is our commitment to the experience of the end user, and the importance we attach to the measurement of that experience. In a market driven by fierce competition and where more and more products are being commoditised, we believe that the development of consumer-centered services is the key in successfully creating services that run through all the touch points between the end user and the brand.
Valtech’s Service Designers help our clients to better understand consumers, gleaning insights that are key to creating new concepts, successful business cases and developing solutions that do not yet exist on the market.
Our approach:
For each service or product that we design, our goal is as much about creating a complete user experience as it is maximising return on investment.
Our process includes:

Market research and contextual interviews to better understand the consumer
Discussion and definition of the objectives of the users and the business vis-à-vis the product or service
Aligning key stakeholders to a shared statement of vision and intention for the product/service
Identification of the client’s critical success factors for the product/service

We visualise the process that users follow before, during, and after using the service and highlight the specific points at which the service responds (or does not respond) to the users’ needs. By mapping the customer pathway, we consistently track the performance of the product/service.
We imagine, co-create or prototype new and innovative concepts
We measure objectives through multiple methods, such as user testing, questionnaires and the evaluation of quantitative data. The analysis and interpretation of this data provides an overview of what needs to be changed about the product/service to better meet the user’s needs and your business objectives
We lay the foundations for continuous improvement. With each new release, we present the progress made since the last one and the obstacles that remain. This allows our customers to track changes made in near-real time. To help our client establish the order of priority, we represent the various features on a simple matrix that shows the importance and the quality of these features for both consumers and the client.
A framework to identify the obstacles
