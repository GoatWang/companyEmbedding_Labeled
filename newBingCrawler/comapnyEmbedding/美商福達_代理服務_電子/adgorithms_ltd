Adgorithms Ltd.


('Adgorithms' or 'the Company')


Company name change


Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to 'Albert Technologies Ltd.'.


The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.


From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.


The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/


Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, 'This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations.'

About Albert Technologies Ltd.

Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand.This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offersartificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.

The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.


About Albert


Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.


Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.


Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.

AlbertTM Named SIIA Business Technology CODiE Award Finalist for Best Advertising or Campaign Management Platform


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Albert, created by Adgorithms (LSE:ADGO), today announced that their 
      signature AI platform was named a 2017 SIIA CODiE Awards finalist in the 
      Best Advertising or Campaign Management category. Finalists represent 
      the best products, technologies, and services in software, information 
      and business technology.


      AlbertTM is the first and only fully autonomous artificial 
      intelligence driven marketing tool that can independently execute 
      transparent, cross-channel digital campaigns. Albert has drastically 
      improved the sales and ROI for every brand “he’s” worked with, vastly 
      exceeding expectations. “His” work has led to grocery stores running 
      out of stock of Dole’s fruit-cocktails, caused Cosabella to 
      completely eliminate 
      their use of traditional advertising agencies, and was credited with 
      40% of Harley-Davidson’s NYC motorcycle sales.


      The SIIA 
      CODiE Awards are the premier awards for the software and information 
      industries, and have been recognizing product excellence for over 30 
      years. The awards offer 93 categories that are organized by industry 
      focus of education technology and business technology. Albert was 
      honored as one of 205 finalists across the 59 business technology 
      categories.


      “I am impressed by the level of innovation and creativity of the 
      products that have been selected as this year's CODiE Award finalists. 
      We are happy to recognize these products and the power they have to 
      transform the future of how we do business.” said Ken Wasch, President 
      of SIIA.


      “This time last year we were trying to educate the marketing industry on 
      artificial intelligence; this year we can confidently say it’s catching 
      on,” said Or Shani, Founder of Albert and CEO of Adgorithms. “The 
      exponential increase in adoption of artificial intelligence—and the 
      drastic increase in sales and ROI that our clients’ campaigns are 
      producing—is indicative of AI’s ability to completely revolutionize the 
      way digital campaigns are run. We are honored to be recognized by such 
      an influential organization.”


      The SIIA CODiE Awards are the industry's only peer-recognized awards 
      program. Business technology leaders including senior executives, 
      analysts, media, consultants and investors evaluate assigned products 
      during the first-round review which determines the finalists. SIIA 
      members then vote on the finalist products and the scores from both 
      rounds are tabulated to select the winners. Winners will be announced 
      during the CODiE 
      Award Business Technology Winner Announcement & Celebration, 
      July 25 in San Francisco.


      Details about each finalist are listed at http://www.siia.net/codie/Finalists


About the SIIA CODiE™ AwardsThe SIIA CODiE Awards is 
      the only peer-reviewed program to showcase business and education 
      technology’s finest products and services. Since 1986, thousands of 
      products, services and solutions have been recognized for achieving 
      excellence. For more information, visit siia.net/CODiE.


About AlbertTM (created by Adgorithms)Albert, 
      created by Adgorithms (LSE: ADGO), is the first-ever fully autonomous 
      artificial intelligence marketing platform, driving digital marketing 
      campaigns from start to finish for some of the world’s leading 
      brands. Albert’s mission is to liberate businesses from the complexities 
      of digital marketing—not just by replicating their existing efforts, but 
      by executing them at a pace and scale not previously possible. He serves 
      as a highly intelligent and sophisticated member of brands’ marketing 
      teams, wading through mass amounts of data, converting this data into 
      insights, and autonomously acting on these insights, across channels, 
      devices and formats, in real time. This eliminates the manual and 
      time-consuming tasks that currently limit the effectiveness and results 
      of modern digital advertising and marketing. Brands such as Harley 
      Davidson, EVISU, Cosabella, and Made.com credit 
      Albert with significantly increased sales, an accelerated path to 
      revenue, the ability to make more informed investment decisions, and 
      reduced operational costs. Visit albert.ai.

Adgorithms Ltd.
("Adgorithms" or "the Company")
Company name change
 
 
Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to "Albert Technologies Ltd.".
The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.
From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.
The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/
Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, "This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations."

About Albert Technologies Ltd.
Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand. This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offers artificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.
The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.
 
About Albert
Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.
 
Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.
 
Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.

Company name changeWed, 12th Jul 2017 12:04RNS Number : 8714K Adgorithms Limited 12 July 2017  

12 July 2017
 
 
Adgorithms Ltd.
("Adgorithms" or "the Company")
Company name change
 
 
Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to "Albert Technologies Ltd.".
The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.
From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.
The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/
Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, "This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations."

About Albert Technologies Ltd.
Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand. This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offers artificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.
The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.
 
About Albert
Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.
 
Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.
 
Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.
