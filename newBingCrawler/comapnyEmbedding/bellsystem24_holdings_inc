Press Release
ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Announces a Comprehensive Business Partnership between ITOCHU Corporation, CTC, and BELLSYSTEM24 Holdings, Inc. in the BPO Business Field with an Emphasis on CRM

Aug 17, 2015
ITOCHU Corporation
ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation
BELLSYSTEM24 Holdings



ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation (headquartered in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; Satoshi Kikuchi, President & CEO; hereinafter "CTC") announced today that it had concluded a comprehensive business partnership with ITOCHU Corporation (headquartered in Minato-ku, Tokyo; Masahiro Okafuji, President & CEO; hereinafter "ITOCHU") and BELLSYSTEM24 Holdings, Inc. (headquartered in Chuo-ku, Tokyo; Kenji Komatsu, President & CEO; hereinafter "BELLSYSTEM24HD") in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) business field. This partnership will primarily focus on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and the contact center business.
					A project team jointly established in July by these three companies will play a key role in promoting the planning and developing new services, deepening relationships with existing customers through joint businesses, and developing new customers.
In recent years, the number of organizations that use BPO service has been on the rise. This increase reflects the desire of organizations to concentrate their management resources, such as human resources and systems, in their key businesses in order to streamline operations. At the same time, more organizations are outsourcing indirect operations to external companies. In the midst of this changing environment, contact centers play a key role in the BPO field. For customers, contact centers are the first point of contact, and the range of operations handled by these centers is expanding as indirect operations diversify. In addition to traditional operations, contact centers are now also responsible for things such as data entry agents, various survey agents, and the creation of operation manuals.
With this comprehensive business partnership, the business know-how on business expansion possessed by ITOCHU, the cutting-edge IT offered by CTC, and the operation know-how on customer operation held by BELLSYSTEM24, Inc. (hereinafter "BELLSYSTEM24"), a group company of BELLSYSTEM24HD, will be combined to provide CRM and contact center services that represent the latest BPO services.
					The aim of this partnership is to develop services to improve customer satisfaction. Specifically, this includes the realization of an omni-channel contact center*1 based on WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), a standard that allows for the communication of sounds and image data on Web browsers, the automatization of services and operations utilizing software robots that facilitate the automatization of operations, and cognitive computing*2 that makes it possible to systematically accumulate operation know-how and the analysis of voices of customers by combining a state-of-the-art affect analysis engine and text mining*3 to streamline operations as well as improve services.
ITOCHU is consistently strengthening its initiatives for non-resource areas with an emphasis on the consumer-related sector. Its aim is to position the BPO business, which is highly compatible with IT, as one of the new core businesses and propel its development.
CTC has handled numerous contact center-related products, and thus is well-versed in the system architecture and operation of a large size contact center that links various products. In addition, CTC is also working on a big data business, which serves as a platform for Cloud utilization and information analysis, in order to improve cost effectiveness. For this reason, CTC has listed the expansion of the BPO business and other service style businesses as a key issue in the mid-term management plan.
BELLSYSTEM24 is a leading company in the CRM field and has over 30 years of experience managing contact centers. It provides high-quality contact center services from its own 25 domestic operation centers and hubs staffed by approximately 22,000 operators. In addition to the traditional service providing methods utilizing telephone as a chief service channel, it is working actively to develop new BPO services utilizing new channels such as SNS.
The project team is determined to actively promote service development and acquire new customers in the future by utilizing its strengths in each business territory, and thereby make a positive impact in the revenue of each organization at an early stage.

1 Corporate Profile CRM Solutions and System Design/Development and System Operation/Maintenance Related to Those Services2 Message from Management A Partner in Customer Growth BELLSYSTEM24 was among the first companies to establish CRM outsourcing through contact center operations as a business model. For more than 30 years since then, we have consistently led the industry, creating several standards. The services we offer our clients stand on two key foundations. One is to surpass clients expectations and forging their excitement with the passion and communication capabilities of the staff who provide the services, that is to say, art. The other is to visualize service quality by harnessing leading-edge technologies to constantly refine quality and efficiency, that is to say, science. We combine these two foundations, art and science, in an effort to raise our services to a striking level that exceeds client expectations. The operating environment that surrounds companies today is changing with increasing speed. Revolutionary shifts are taking place in the styles of communications that link companies and customers and in the way they are used in business. These changes may gather momentum, and will certainly not slow down. We must anticipate the future direction and act accordingly, to offer more definite value and excitement to our clients. While guaranteeing quality based on an integration of art and science, BELLSYSTEM24 remains committed to ongoing efforts to establish extra value, which is a reputation for never failing to offer solutions and options that increase value for clients in response to their inquiries. As it moves into a new era, BELLSYSTEM24 will evolve from an outsourcing service provider that works with clients to boost their customers satisfaction into a partner for growth. BELLSYSTEM24, Inc. Kenji Komatsu President3 Our Services Service Features Infrastructure x Solutions x Quality Providing optimal, high-quality services on a solid foundation BELLSYSTEM24 provides CRM solution services that link our client companies and their customers. Active relations with customers are, of course, important assets for business management. And the ways companies relate with customers are more diverse than before, varying greatly due to the emergence of different forms of communication and depending on the combination of the forms. With infrastructure for such communications, BELLSYSTEM24 has a system for providing appropriate solutions for customers issues while ensuring optimal quality of the solutions irrespective of their form. By taking advantage of the synergy between these elements, we provide services that satisfy our client companies.

        August 17, 2015
      


      ITOCHU Corporation (headquartered in Minato-ku, Tokyo; Masahiro Okafuji, President & CEO; hereinafter "ITOCHU") announced today that it had concluded a comprehensive business partnership with ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation (headquartered in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; Satoshi Kikuchi, President & CEO; hereinafter "CTC") and BELLSYSTEM24 Holdings, Inc. (headquartered in Chuo-ku, Tokyo; Kenji Komatsu, President & CEO; hereinafter "BELLSYSTEM24HD") in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) business field. This partnership will primarily focus on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and the contact center business.
      A project team jointly established in July by these three companies will play a key role in promoting the planning and developing new services, deepening relationships with existing customers through joint businesses, and developing new customers.
    

      In recent years, the number of organizations that use BPO service has been on the rise. This increase reflects the desire of organizations to concentrate their management resources, such as human resources and systems, in their key businesses in order to streamline operations. At the same time, more organizations are outsourcing indirect operations to external companies. In the midst of this changing environment, contact centers play a key role in the BPO field. For customers, contact centers are the first point of contact, and the range of operations handled by these centers is expanding as indirect operations diversify. In addition to traditional operations, contact centers are now also responsible for things such as data entry agents, various survey agents, and the creation of operation manuals.
    

      With this comprehensive business partnership, the business know-how on business expansion possessed by ITOCHU, the cutting-edge IT offered by CTC, and the operation know-how on customer operation held by BELLSYSTEM24, Inc. (hereinafter "BELLSYSTEM24"), a group company of BELLSYSTEM24HD, will be combined to provide CRM and contact center services that represent the latest BPO services.
      The aim of this partnership is to develop services to improve customer satisfaction. Specifically, this includes the realization of an omni-channel contact center*1 based on WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), a standard that allows for the communication of sounds and image data on Web browsers, the automatization of services and operations utilizing software robots that facilitate the automatization of operations, and cognitive computing*2 that makes it possible to systematically accumulate operation know-how and the analysis of voices of customers by combining a state-of-the-art affect analysis engine and text mining*3 to streamline operations as well as improve services.
    

      ITOCHU is consistently strengthening its initiatives for non-resource areas with an emphasis on the consumer-related sector. Its aim is to position the BPO business, which is highly compatible with IT, as one of the new core businesses and propel its development.
    

      CTC has handled numerous contact center-related products, and thus is well-versed in the system architecture and operation of a large size contact center that links various products. In addition, CTC is also working on a big data business, which serves as a platform for Cloud utilization and information analysis, in order to improve cost effectiveness. For this reason, CTC has listed the expansion of the BPO business and other service style businesses as a key issue in the mid-term management plan.
    

      BELLSYSTEM24 is a leading company in the CRM field and has over 30 years of experience managing contact centers. It provides high-quality contact center services from its own 25 domestic operation centers and hubs staffed by approximately 22,000 operators. In addition to the traditional service providing methods utilizing telephone as a chief service channel, it is working actively to develop new BPO services utilizing new channels such as SNS.
    

      The project team is determined to actively promote service development and acquire new customers in the future by utilizing its strengths in each business territory, and thereby make a positive impact in the revenue of each organization at an early stage.


          *1: Omni-channel contact center
        

          Omni-channel contact center refers to a contact center that can communicate with the same customer through multiple channels such as telephone, fax, mail, SNS, chat, and videophone. They are able to provide consistent services by linking various channels.
        

          *2: Cognitive computing
        

          Cognitive computing refers to a system that utilizes a large quantity of data and can understand natural languages spoken by human beings, as well as learn languages through conversation.
        

          *3: Text mining
        

          Text mining refers to a method or system that divides a group of non-standard sentences into words and phrases by utilizing a method of natural language analysis, and then extracts effective information by analyzing the frequency of use and correlations between words.

Market Scramble: Investors dream of trickle-up from inflation 
Materials and machinery stocks attract buying as producer prices rise
TAKEHIKO HAMA, Nikkei staff writer






TOKYO -- An upswing in Japan's producer prices has investors interested in companies such as materials and machinery makers that possess strong enough bargaining power to pass higher costs and more to customers.The Nikkei Stock Average slid for the fourth straight day on Friday. But overall losses were slim and turnover was brisk, topping 2 trillion yen ($18.4 billion) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section despite many foreign traders taking off for the Easter holiday.While nearly 80% of first section issues closed lower, semiconductor makers Sumco and Shin-Etsu Chemical climbed 1.96% and 0.14%, respectively. "Companies that can pass on high material costs in the form of higher product prices are easy buys now that expectations for yen depreciation are dimming," said Takeshi Kamoshita, a fund manager at Asset Management One. A tight market for semiconductor wafers means their makers can raise prices with relative impunity, he added.Pass it alongJapan's recovering corporate goods prices are behind this focus on price hikes. The producer price index advanced on the year for the third straight month in March, the Bank of Japan reported Wednesday. Oil and other energy prices have bounced back from a recent dip, and general prices are on the rise again after a period of stagnation.A company's ability to raise prices on products is now key to success. Businesses offering highly competitive goods, as Shin-Etsu does with semiconductor wafers, can turn higher material prices into an opportunity to raise product prices and fatten profit margins, rather than a worrisome source of higher costs.Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal gained 1.73% Friday. "Japan's [steel] supply structure is getting an overhaul as well as China's," said Harunobu Goroh of Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Closing or merging facilities are laying the groundwork for prices to climb.Electronics and machinery makers such as Yaskawa Electric and Okuma could also see performance improve. An index of 17 issues whose profit margins are strongly correlated with consumer prices has performed nearly 20% better than the Topix index of all first section listings over the past year or so, according to Nomura Securities.Getting ready to spendOnly a small number of companies are robust enough to pass on price increases so easily. While the overall producer price index gained 1.4% on the year in March, prices of final goods -- those closest to consumers -- fell. Shoppers are still leery about opening their pocketbooks, leaving little room for sellers to raise prices.But signs of improvement are on the horizon. Call center operator Bellsystem24 Holdings on Thursday forecast net profit jumping 23% for the year ending February 2018, despite an expected increase in labor costs. Investors took this as an acknowledgement that higher costs could be passed along to clients, and sent shares as high as 9% above Thursday's close on Friday.According to Asset Management One's Kamoshita, stock market players would like to see companies pass gains on to workers in the form of higher wages, which would, in theory, energize consumption, expanding earnings further. Hopes for such a cycle are high, as Bellsystem24's surge shows. Wage increases in the service sector could help vanquish the deflation that has dogged Japan for decades, with sizable benefits for the stock market.
