General Overview


About Caltex Australia
Cars, planes and ships have forever been symbols of freedom. They made freedom obtainable. Freedom is a powerful ideal, a feeling that is empowering and liberating. Freedom and convenience are ultimately about choice and the ability to control your own outcomes. Distance, perishability, quality, range and time are no longer restrictive forces in the marketplace. Business and consumers are in the now generation, and this ultimately drives absolute freedom of choice for everyone. It’s our ability to deliver on this that drives our business and leverages our deep capabilities in making big things happen easily, everywhere.Proudly Australian, Caltex have grown from humble beginnings to become the nation’s outright leader in transport fuels, supplying one third of all Australia’s transport fuel needs. Through a flexible fuel supply chain, they have forged a reputation for providing safe and reliable supply of high-quality fuels to a diverse number of customer segments, including retail, mining, agriculture, aviation, transport, small-to-medium enterprises, marine, automotive and government. Caltex are also one of Australia’s largest convenience retailers and franchisors, with over 85% of their stores operated by franchisees.





History
As an Australian company, with roots tracking back to 1900, they are the only Australian fuel and convenience brand listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Caltex's long history began years ago when the all-Australian oil importer Ampol, was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in the late 1940s. Both Caltex and Ampol opened refineries in the 1950s and 1960s, and the two companies competed fiercely in the service station arena and oil product marketing industry. As time went on, Ampol acquired Total and Caltex went on to acquire Golden Fleece.Despite these developments, Caltex and Ampol were still relatively small. Eventually, their 1995 merger helped the company become the largest refiner-marketer in Australia.What sets Caltex apart from other refiner-marketers in Australia is that they're an Australian company that operates independently, with all decisions made by the management and the Board in Australia. Caltex are listed on the ASX and have around 3,500 employees working across the country.
