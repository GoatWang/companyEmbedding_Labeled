Digital Garage Invests in Blockchain Developer Blockstream, Collaborating Toward the Verification Testing of Financial Technology Products
- Applications in smart contract services and next-generation payment platforms -



Tokyo, February 4, 2016 - Digital Garage, Inc. (TSE JASDAQ: 4819, DG) has invested in Blockstream Corp. (Blockstream), a firm engaged in the development of blockchain-related technology, through the wholly-owned investment and incubation subsidiary of Digital Garage, DG Incubation Inc. (DGI), along with Horizon Capital and AXA Strategic Ventures. Blockstream has raised $55million in this round of Series A funding.
Established in January 2014, Blockstream has many of the technical experts at the forefront of Bitcoin development in its team, and is renowned for carrying out advanced product development in order for blockchains, the fundamental technology behind cryptocurrencies and bitcoins, to be used for a variety of industries and applications. They garnered considerable attention in November 2014 after raising $21 million in funding just ten months after the founding of their company, with LinkedIn's founder Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures, and Real Ventures as the lead investors.
In October 2015, Blockstream announced the "sidechain" open platform technology in order to promote the development of services using blockchains. Sidechains are special because they are interoperable with blockchains that use bitcoins, while at the same time allowing technological innovation by being branched out from the parent chain. As a result, the development of the structure of platforms using various digital currencies and "Smart Contracts", the automation of the handling of contracts, will become easier. Another special feature is that the sidechain technology is publicly available under an open source license, meaning that anyone can use it to develop services using blockchains.
The reason for DG's investment is due to open innovation in cooperation with a number of firms in the development and verification testing of financial technology services aimed at the Japanese market using Blockstream's technology. Specifically, DG is working with a business incubator, Bengo4.com, Inc., in the field of "Legal Tech"--which has already gained attention in the US--by researching the development of a smart contract system that is optimized for Japanese business practices in the form of their electronic contract service, CloudSign. DG is planning to continue this work while also organizing a consortium of banks and credit card companies on a next-generation payment platform where it is possible to use digital currencies and multiple point services.

This is part of our coverage of the Infinity Ventures Summit 2015 Fall in Kyoto, Japan.
See the original story in Japanese.
Infinity Venture Partners, a Tokyo-based global investment fund, organized its semi-annual startup showcasing event in Kyoto earlier this month, where 14 startups exhibited their products to investors and entrepreneurs. Hokkaido-based Agri Info Design won the top prize with their mobile app solution called AgriBus-Navi.
Here’s a quick rundown of the top five winners and finalists.
1st prize winner: AgriBus-NAVI (by Agri Info Design)

AgriBus-NAVI is a mobile app for installation on farm machinery like tractors, crop harvesters, and self-propelled sprayers for checkrow planting.
One of the utmost difficulties in farmwork is confirmation as to agrochemical spraying having  been performed properly because rough chemical spraying causes fertilizers to be wasted. This mobile app replaces conventional GPS-based systems that have been used to solve such issues.
2nd prize winner: Nutte (by State of Mind)

Nutte is a crowdsourced platform of seamstresses, receiving orders for all manufacturing processes for creation of clothing, from design to sewing. Differentiating from similar Japanese services like Sitateru, Nutte allows users to order their originally designed clothing or items using an image sketch.

Bengo4.com Taichiro Motoe
Bengo4.com, the company behind Japan’s foremost legal portal under the same name, was listed on the TSE Mothers Market in December 2014. The company recently launched an online contract signing platform called CloudSign.
Using the CloudSign platform, a sender of a contract is requested to upload an agreement form in PDF format designating which part of the form should be filled by a recipient. Then the recipient will receive an e-mail containing a unique URL to browse the form. As the recipient signs the form with a digital signature, the finalized version of the form will be shared on both sides by each other via the platform.

4th prize winner: Anyca (by Anyca)

Upon the approval, both parties can arrange a delivery place of the car each other. The user will be requested to return the car to the owner after the use. Allowing users to apply for a car insurance by the day, the service is aimed to secure both easiness and safety. The service is a provided by a group company of DeNA (TSE:2432), a Japanese leading mobile gaming company.
5th prize winner: Repro (by Repro)

Repro is a startup behind a mobile app analysis and marketing tool, having won pitch competitions at startup events like our Mixer Tokyo and B Dash Camp.

LiveConnect (by Z-Works)

Z-Works has developed a home gateway device, a cloud platform and mobile app leveraging sensors corresponding to the Z-wave standard, a wireless communication specification for home automation. Amongst their products, LiveConnect is an IoT (Internet of Things) service for home security.

Medicine Delivery (by Minacolor)

Minacolor has been offering advice on medicines and treatments by pharmacists online. The company started an on-demand medicine delivery service in November of 2013.
Using the service, a pharmacist from the company will choose an appropriate medicine according to one’s symptom and their deliverer will bring it to the door of one’s home within the shortest delivery time of 30 minutes after receiving the order. The service is currently available in the central district of Tokyo, or the southern part of the area surrounded by Yamanote Loop Line.
Users will need to place an order using a mobile app so that it will record their order history upon considering multiple drug intake or future ordering convenience. The company takes about 5,000 yen (or about $41) on average from each order with an average profitability of 10%, aiming to crowdsource jobs to 80,000 qualified pharmacists who want to work at home.
Popcorn (by Coubic)

Coubic is a startup known for a freemium scheduling and appointment booking solution under the same name. The company provides a mobile app offering special deals on last-minute bookings for beauty and massage salons, called Popcorn. Available only for booking up to 15 minutes prior to receiving, the app adopts advance payment to reduce the risk of cancellation for salon owners. These salon owners can use the Coubic platform to better manage customers.

Fitty (by Scala International)

Fitty is a mobile app that helps women find the proper fit for lingerie pieces. By entering several selections like bra size or body shape into the app, it will suggest users the best-fit selection of bras. In order to enable presentation of best suggestions to users, the company has been collecting up-to-date product profiles from fashion retailers and manufacturers to incorporate them into the app.
As an extension of the recommendation result, the app will give users a link so that they can purchase bra items online. The company is considering launch of a business which provides statistical data of bra wearers to lingerie manufacturers.
Partee (by g&h)

Partee is a mobile app that allows users to create a T-shirt or smartphone cases using their favorite pictures. Users can also create it using pictures uploaded by not only them but also their friends. When one’s picture is used by other users, some revenue will be shared with the owner of the picture.
Monomy (by Fun Up)

Monomy is an iOS app that offers an online marketplace for creatives, allowing people to make accessories they like with ease using smartphones. The platform was launched in August by Fun Up, the Tokyo-based company which has been running several online services since 2011.
The difference between trendy marketplaces for handmade goods and Monomy is that users only need to design the accessories they want. What happens is that Monomy takes care of the whole process from receiving orders through production in their own workshop. They can take large orders such as orders for 1,000 items and make them all in their workshop, with the accessories being made by experienced craftspeople by hand.

LifeStyle Design, the company behind the service, fundraised about 100 million yen (or about $830,000) from Nissay Capital in May.

        Tokyo, February 4, 2016 - Digital Garage, Inc. (TSE JASDAQ: 4819, DG) has invested in Blockstream Corp. (Blockstream), a firm engaged in the development of blockchain-related technology, through the wholly-owned investment and incubation subsidiary of Digital Garage, DG Incubation Inc. (DGI), along with Horizon Capital and AXA Strategic Ventures. Blockstream has raised $55million in this round of Series A funding.
      

        Established in January 2014, Blockstream has many of the technical experts at the forefront of Bitcoin development in its team, and is renowned for carrying out advanced product development in order for blockchains, the fundamental technology behind cryptocurrencies and bitcoins, to be used for a variety of industries and applications. They garnered considerable attention in November 2014 after raising $21 million in funding just ten months after the founding of their company, with LinkedIn's founder Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures, and Real Ventures as the lead investors.
      

        In October 2015, Blockstream announced the 'sidechain' open platform technology in order to promote the development of services using blockchains. Sidechains are special because they are interoperable with blockchains that use bitcoins, while at the same time allowing technological innovation by being branched out from the parent chain. As a result, the development of the structure of platforms using various digital currencies and 'Smart Contracts', the automation of the handling of contracts, will become easier. Another special feature is that the sidechain technology is publicly available under an open source license, meaning that anyone can use it to develop services using blockchains.
      

        The reason for DG's investment is due to open innovation in cooperation with a number of firms in the development and verification testing of financial technology services aimed at the Japanese market using Blockstream's technology. Specifically, DG is working with a business incubator, Bengo4.com, Inc., in the field of 'Legal Tech'--which has already gained attention in the US--by researching the development of a smart contract system that is optimized for Japanese business practices in the form of their electronic contract service, CloudSign. DG is planning to continue this work while also organizing a consortium of banks and credit card companies on a next-generation payment platform where it is possible to use digital currencies and multiple point services.
