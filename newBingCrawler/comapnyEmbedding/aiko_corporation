– Innovation Strategy
– Education & Future Learning Models
– Social
– Mobile
– The AIKO Process


Our approach to innovation strategy is centered upon our belief that the products and services we design should create maximum impact in the marketplace at launch, while driving our client’s long-term goals. We strive to holistically understand our clients’ business strategy and corporate culture, collaborating with a broad set of stakeholders — from product to marketing — to ensure a fully developed roadmap for commercialization. Our approach considers market trends, culture, technology, design thinking, the consumer voice and human factors. And wherever possible, we work with our clients to create socially innovative solutions that effect positive change in people and communities.
















– Brand Experience
– Strategy
– Message & Positioning
– Creation & Design
– Communications


At AIKO, our brand team helps clients identify and express a brand’s promise through authentic experiences that connect with consumers on multiple levels — emotional, intellectual and physical. We drive brand value by merging ethnographic, contextual and quantitative research, business and competitive mapping, and rich exploration of outlier ideas and third-party catalysts. From kitchen to classroom, mobile to aisle, our team designs fluid brand experiences that consumers love.
















– Mobile
– Web
– Product
– Service


When so much rides on a consumer’s interaction with mobile, web, apps or social platforms, we help our clients deliver the most intuitive, seamless and engaging experiences possible. Guided by our focused research and end-user testing, we merge information architecture, application UI and visual design capabilities to create exceptional solutions. We work closely with our clients to ensure that specifications translate across all functional areas to deliver on product goals.
















– Contextual Studies
– Ethnographic Studies
– Usability Studies
– Game Studies


Research not only drives our solutions — it fuels our imagination. Our research takes us into the physical and online spaces where consumers live, learn and play. Through an array of qualitative research methods — including ethnography, contextual research, behavioral segmentation, mobile research and collaboration labs — we come to understand their needs, preferences, emotional drivers, and the critical paths they take towards information or purchasing. And as we listen to and work with consumers as partners, their stories can often become a part of the broader brand journey. In tandem with our understanding of market trends and competitive mapping, we are able to zero in on the pithy insight that leads to the most impactful design concept.
