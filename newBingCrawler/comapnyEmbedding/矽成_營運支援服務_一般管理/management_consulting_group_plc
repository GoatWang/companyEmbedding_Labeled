Strategic Product Management:  It Starts With Your CustomersSuccessful product management is strategic product management.  Strategic: It begins with customer needs.  It reflects industry trends and market forces.  It meshes with your vision and goals.  And it aligns with your internal resources, from engineering to sales and marketing to your c-level executive team. Strategic product management helps you focus most on the ideas and opportunities that generate the best ROI.  At Product Management Consulting Group (PMCG), our mission is to improve your product management process — to make it more strategic and, ultimately, much more successful.  We help our clients with every element of product management, from gathering and prioritizing requirements to devising go-to-market strategies.  When you apply a rigorous, strategy-based product management process, the results can be dramatic: increased market share, revenue and margin growth, and substantial improvements in customer satisfaction and product quality.

Proudfoot[edit]
Company overview[edit]
Proudfoot is a consulting company eponymous of its founder, Alexander Proudfoot, that was founded in Chicago, Illinois during 1946. Over its history it has also opened offices in South Africa, Hong Kong, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Chile, UK and Mexico City. The company was initially known as Proudfoot Consulting PLC, and changed its name to that of its founder in 2009. The company provides strategies for improving the financial and operational infrastructure of client companies. Industries that the company has worked within include the defense industry, automotive industry, banking and construction sectors, insurance, life sciences, mining, oil and gas, manufacturing and retail, telecommunications, and transportation.[3] The firm works with private and public companies, and is hired to improve the efficiency of those companies over either short-term or long-term contracts.[4][5] The CEO and Chairman of the firm is Nick Stagg.[6]
Studies[edit]
Proudfoot also produces studies regarding workforce dynamics. A 2007 study of theirs showed that during that year, the manufacturing sector had a 37% rate of unproductive work force time, and that worldwide companies were 29% below optimum productive efficiency.[7][8][9] Further studies by the firm showing non-productivity have shown that the fault is not always with the employees, and that often the lack of productivity is the result of bad or faulty management.[10] In 2009 a study by Alexander Proudfoot showed that on average a salesperson only spends one fifth of their day actually prospecting or closing sales, and usually believes they have spent twice the time they actually have on sales work.[11]
Kurt Salmon[edit]
Main article: Kurt Salmon
Kurt Salmon is a global management and strategy consulting firm formed by the merger of Ineum Consulting and Kurt Salmon Associates (KSA) in January 2011. In 2016, Accenture acquired Kurt Salmon.[12]
