Travis
Director of Event Technology VI



I began my career with PSAV as a technician shortly after graduating college back in the fall of 2008. One of the very first things I noticed about PSAV is that if you have the drive and the willingness to put in the work you can really move forward and further along your career in whatever direction you decide. PSAV offers exceptional training programs and really I really feel like they invest in their employees which they consider their most valuable asset.

PSAV allows me to maintain a great work / life balance. I thoroughly enjoy the culture, and our management always makes themselves available for questions and insight. Overall, my team makes my job fun and I'm proud of all the hard work and integrity my team achieves on a daily basis!  We work as a team to help make our customer’s job a bit easier by providing them with tools they ask for and can use.

Dawn
Regional Vice President, Sales



I love this job because every day that I come to work, I get to be part of creating an experience for our guests.  Every day is different in our industry; not all of them are great days, but they are all fulfilling.  I love working for this company because it affords me the flexibility of career path I might not get in a smaller company.

This company has also supported my career as a Navy Reservist, and the people and organization both have supported me through two deployments. I am always proud to say I work for PSAV.

Supplier News19 January 2015PSAV® Acquires American Audio Visual Center

PSAV announced today it has acquired American Audio Visual Center (AAVC), an in-house, high-end production company based in Scottsdale, AZ. AAVC has been supporting clients with "Extreme Customer Service" and cutting-edge technology support in partnership with over 65 hotels and resorts, as well as through a full-service boutique production division.

This investment follows PSAV's acquisition by Goldman Sachs and Olympus Partners in January of 2014 and is an affirmation of the ongoing opportunity represented by the U.S. meetings and events market. PSAV continues to seek opportunities to augment its resources in key meeting cities with a goal of being the ultimate local resource for corporate, association, and event planners. These customers will benefit from increased access to specialized technicians, consultative sales, creative services and advanced equipment.

"We are thrilled to welcome the executives and team members of AAVC. Their cultural focus on service, creativity, and technology innovation makes them a natural fit as part of the PSAV family," said PSAV President and CEO, Mike McIlwain. "We believe we complement each other extremely well. It means more access to more resources for our hotel and client partners."
AAVC's executive leadership will remain in place to manage company operations and key customer relationships. AAVC will operate independently while the companies identify the best opportunity to enhance service and support to their hotel, corporate, and association customers.
PSAV offers unparalleled local resources throughout the United States and around the world to support creative production and staging of meetings and events across the corporate, association, tradeshow and special event industries. Provided with a hospitality approach, PSAV's services include audio, video, video mapping, lighting, creative, 3-D rendering and CAD support, stage design, production, rigging, power, virtual meetings, simultaneous interpretation, internet and network support. PSAV has been recognized for its technology innovation including its bandwidth management service, Meeting Room Manager™, as well as SwankDraw®, for on-site digital renderings. PSAV can trace its rich heritage back to 1937.
