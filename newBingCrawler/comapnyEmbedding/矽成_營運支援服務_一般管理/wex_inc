About the Norwex Movement
The global Norwex community is committed to providing educational resources and supporting charitable projects that address growing concerns about harmful chemicals, plastic pollution and environmental issues.

























            Nearly 80% of all waste on our land and in our oceans now consists of plastic debris.
        



            Of 85,000 chemicals in existence today, only 200 have been tested by the EPA.
        



            88% of ocean surfaces are covered in plastic pollution
        



            By 2050 scientists estimate oceans will have more plastic than fish (by weight)
