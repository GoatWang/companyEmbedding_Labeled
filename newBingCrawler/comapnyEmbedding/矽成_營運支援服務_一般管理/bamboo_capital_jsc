UK’s Ross Group joins hands with Bamboo Capital to invest up to $100m in Vietnam

The UK electronics and energy-related product distributor Ross Group will raise $100 million from the international capital market to invest in Vietnam, as per a partnership it has recently sealed with the Vietnam-based investment firm Bamboo Capital.
Bamboo Capital said that it will collaborate with Ross Group in exploring investment opportunities in Vietnam, with focus on the areas of technology, infrastructure, energy and real estate. Specifically, Bamboo Capital will support the British group in building subsidiaries as well as executing investments in Vietnamese businesses. Electronics and energy will be picked as the first sectors to deploy the partnership, the Vietnamese firm said.
Launched in 1918, Ross Group has been specialising in the electronics industry, with offices in the US, Canada and Hong Kong. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange main board in 1973. Its principal operation of distributing consumer electronic products and supply chain management activities are performed by its wholly owned subsidiary, Sansui (UK) Ltd. Meanwhile, financial services for the company are predominately handled through the Hong Kong unit San Gain Ltd.
Bamboo Capital has just raised its charter capital to VND407 billion ($18.7 million) in March and was listed on July 16. The company’s shares closed Tuesday up at the ceiling price of VND17,100.
The Vietnamese financial service company was the consulting agency for two investments of the US-based Global Emerging Markets in multi-sector firms Duc Long Gia Lai Group (for a 20 per cent stake) and Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group (10 per cent) last year.
In April, Duc Long Gia Lai announced to sell all of its holdings in two affiliates to Bamboo Capital, including 91.71 per cent in Duc Long Gia Lai Wood Processing JSC and 19.5 per cent in Tay Nguyen Mineral and Metallurgy JSC, both at VND13,000 per share.
