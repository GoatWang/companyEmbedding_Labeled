BOCA RATON, Fla., July 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cross Country Healthcare (NASDAQ:    CCRN) has been named as one of the Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA) 2016 Largest Staffing Firms in the United States.  This is a tremendous honor for the organization and highlights Cross Country Healthcare's position as a leader in the healthcare staffing industry.  After experiencing 24% revenue growth last year, we moved from #21 in 2015 to #19 in 2016. 













                Cross Country Healthcare has been named as one of the Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA) 2016 Largest Staffing Firms in the United States.
              

 
 



Known as an industry leader in data and research, SIA is a global advisor on staffing and workforce solutions.  Requirements to be on this list include generating at least $100 million in U.S. staffing revenue in 2015.  Firms on the list generated $75.7 billion in revenue, making up 56.8% of the total market by SIA estimates.
"The companies featured on this year's report combined to generate $75.7 billion in US staffing revenue last year," said Timothy Landhui, Research Manager at Staffing Industry Analysts. "This marked a solid increase from the $69.4 billion of 2014 revenue featured in last year's report, and provides evidence of overall growth in staffing revenue among large firms."
"Our rise on the SIA 2016 Largest Staffing Firms in the United States list is very important to our organization. It is validation of our commitment to maintaining a leadership position in everything we do. If we do not remain steadfast to delivering the highest quality services and healthcare professionals, we would not continue to grow as an organization", explains William Grubbs, President and CEO of Cross Country Healthcare. "Our ability to ultimately grow revenue is the result of hard-working, dedicated corporate employees that continue to produce results… day-in and day-out." 
In addition to having his organization rank on SIA's 2016 list, Mr. Grubbs has also been featured, for four consecutive years, on the publication's list of Top 100 Most Influential People in Staffing.

  Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCRN) ("Company" or "Cross Country"), a leading provider of healthcare staffing and workforce solutions, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Advantage RN, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Advantage"), effective July 1, 2017. This acquisition provides Cross Country with another well-respected brand and go-to-market approach, and also increases the supply of healthcare professionals to support Cross Country's diverse customer base, most notably its many Managed Service Provider programs. Cross Country expects the transaction to result in meaningful earnings accretion in 2017 through increased scale and accelerated growth opportunities.  William J. Grubbs, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cross Country Healthcare stated, "We welcome Advantage RN to the Cross Country family. Our companies are a great match with complementary capabilities to better serve all of our customers. Together, we are better positioned to pursue our collective strategy for market expansion, revenue growth and enhanced shareholder value."  "Advantage RN has enjoyed a long and successful working relationship with Cross Country, and our cultures and goals are closely aligned - to deliver quality services to our customers, create more opportunities for our candidates, provide a great working environment for our employees, and ultimately, better patient care," said Matthew R. Price, President and CEO of Advantage RN. "While we retain the Advantage RN name and the recognition it carries in the industry, we now boast a new identity as part of the Cross Country family and the bright future we will build together."  Cross Country acquired substantially all of the assets of Advantage for a total purchase price of $88 million, which is subject to a final net working capital adjustment. At closing, the Company paid $86.8 million, net of cash acquired, using $19.9 million in available cash and $66.9 million in borrowing under its Credit Facility, including a $40 million incremental term loan. The amount paid at closing was subject to an initial net working capital adjustment of $0.6 million, and an additional $0.6 million was deferred and is due to the seller within 20 months, less any COBRA and healthcare expenses incurred by Cross Country on behalf of the former sellers. Based on the total net leverage ratio, the combined interest rate at close is expected to be 3.5%.

"We had a solid second quarter highlighted by year-over-year revenue growth in all three reporting segments. With revenue in line with expectations, I was pleased that we exceeded guidance for Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS," said William J. Grubbs, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our new MSP implementations are progressing and we expect an increase in demand from these programs through the third and fourth quarters. Coupled with the delivery capabilities from the Advantage RN acquisition, we expect to see stronger revenue growth as we enter 2018."
Second quarter consolidated revenue was $209.3 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Consolidated gross profit margin was 27.0%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $4.9 million compared to a net loss of $17.2 million in the prior year, which included a loss on early extinguishment of debt, a loss on derivative liability, and impairment charges, totaling $22.4 million after taxes. Diluted EPS was $0.13 per share compared to a loss of $0.54 per share in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.9 million or 5.2% of revenue, as compared with $11.1 million or 5.5% of revenue in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.16 for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 and $0.05 in the prior quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, consolidated revenue was $416.9 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated gross profit margin was 26.3%, down 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million or 4.2% of revenue, as compared with $19.6 million or 4.9% of revenue in the prior year. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or a net loss of $0.26 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.21 compared to $0.25 in the prior year.
Quarterly Business Segment Highlights
Nurse and Allied Staffing
Revenue from Nurse and Allied Staffing was $180.9 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year and a decrease of 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in segment revenue was predominantly due to higher volume. Contribution income in this segment was $18.1 million, up from $17.6 million in the prior year. Average field FTEs increased to 7,155 from 6,884 in the prior year. Revenue per FTE per day was $278 compared to $275 in the prior year, primarily reflecting a change in the mix of business.
Physician Staffing
Revenue from Physician Staffing was $24.7 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in volume. Contribution income was $2.0 million, consistent with the prior year. Compared to the prior year, total days filled increased to 15,220 from 14,480, primarily due to volume growth in advanced practice professionals. Revenue per day filled increased to $1,557 from $1,525 due to improved pricing partly offset by the change in mix of specialties.
Other Human Capital Management Services
Revenue from Other Human Capital Management Services was $3.7 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. Contribution income was $0.2 million, compared to $0.1 million in the prior year.
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Highlights
Cash flow provided by operating activities for the current quarter was $24.1 million compared to $10.3 million in the same period of the prior year. At June 30, 2017, the Company had $33.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $37.6 million of total debt. There were no borrowings drawn on its $100.0 million revolving credit facility, and $21.6 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $78.4 million available for borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
Renewal of Credit Agreement
As previously announced, the July acquisition of Advantage RN was funded using available cash and borrowings of approximately $67.5 million under the existing credit facility, including a $40 million incremental term loan. Subsequent to the acquisition, on August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Amendment and Restatement to its Credit Agreement to refinance and increase the current aggregate committed size of the facility to $215 million, including a term loan of $100 million and a $115 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds of $106.5 million from this refinancing included $6.5 million under the new revolving credit facility, and were used to repay borrowings under the Company's previously existing credit facilities, as well as to pay related interest, fees and expenses.

 (a) 
 Acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily represents the fair value and accretion adjustments to the contingent consideration liabilities for the Mediscan acquisition that closed on October 30, 2015 and the US Resources Healthcare acquisition that closed on December 1, 2016. 


 (b) 
 Acquisition and integration costs are primarily related to due diligence for the Advantage RN, LLC acquisition that closed on July 5, 2017. 


 (c) 
 The three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes non-cash impairment charges of $24.3 million ($17.3 million after taxes) related to the Physician Staffing reporting unit. 


 (d) 
 Loss (gain) on derivative liability represents the change in the fair value of embedded features of our Convertible Notes up until their repayment. 


 (e) 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and six months ended June 30, 2017 is related to the Company's settlement of its convertible notes on March 17, 2017. Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 relates to the write-off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs as well as transaction fees and expenses related to the extinguishment of the Company's subordinated term loan. 


 (f) 
 When applying the if-converted method to our Convertible Notes, 3,521,126 shares are not included in diluted weighted average shares for the three months ended June 30, 2016 because their effect was anti-dilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017, 2,934,271 shares and 1,459,030 shares, respectively, were included in diluted weighted average shares. 


 (g) 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, impairment charges, loss (gain) on derivative liability, loss on early extinguishment of debt, other income, net, equity compensation, and includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and as one performance measure in its incentive programs for certain members of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, closely matches the operating measure typically used in the Company's credit facilities in calculating various ratios. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by the Company's consolidated revenue. 


 (h) 
 Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders per diluted share before the diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, impairment charges, loss (gain) on derivative liability, and loss on early extinguishment of debt. Adjusted EPS should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP.  Management presents Adjusted EPS because it believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful supplement to its reported EPS as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EPS as one performance measure in its annual cash incentive program for certain members of its management team. Management believes it provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance from period to period and is more representative of the future earnings capacity of the Company. 


 (i)  
 Tax impact on the non-GAAP items is related to the impairment charges on indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Physician Staffing business for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016. There is no tax impact on the other items due to the Company's full valuation allowance for all reported periods. 


 (j) 
 Segment data provided is in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. 


 (k) 
 Contribution income is defined as income or loss from operations before depreciation and amortization, loss on sale of business, acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, and corporate expenses not specifically identified to a reporting segment. Contribution income is a financial measure used by management when assessing segment performance. 


 (l) 
 Unallocated corporate overhead includes corporate compensation and benefits, and general and administrative expenses including rent and utilities, computer supplies and expenses, insurance, professional expenses, corporate-wide projects (initiatives), and public company expense. 


 (m) 
 FTEs represent the average number of Nurse and Allied Staffing contract personnel on a full-time equivalent basis. 


 (n) 
 Average revenue per FTE per day is calculated by dividing the Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue by the number of days worked in the respective periods. Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue also includes revenue from the permanent placement of nurses. 


 (o) 
 Days filled is calculated by dividing the total hours invoiced during the period by 8 hours. 


 (p) 
 Revenue per day filled is calculated by dividing revenue invoiced by days filled for the period presented.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Tailored Brands, Inc. (NYSE: TLRD – Free Report ), Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCRN – Free Report ), Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLAY – Free Report ), PulteGroup Inc. (NYSE: PHM – Free Report ) and Fidelity & Guaranty Life (NYSE: FGL – Free Report ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: 5 Stocks to Buy on Big New Jobs NumbersJob additions increased significantly in January in yet another signal that President Trump has inherited a particularly healthy economy. In fact, the labor market is nearing full employment, borne out by the decline in wage gains. However, hiring remains strong overall and there is evidence to show that more and more people are returning to join the workforce.Meanwhile, it is widely expected that the new administration will soon be taking strong measures to boost domestic employment. Currently, retail trade, construction, financial and professional services and the restaurant sector are at the forefront of job gains. This is why investing in stocks from these areas would make for a smart choice.Highest Job Additions in Four MonthsThe U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs during the month of January, significantly higher than the 157,000 jobs added during December. This also exceeds the consensus estimate of 174,000 job additions. Additionally, these are the best monthly job gains since September.For the month of January, the retail, construction, finance and professional services sectors provided the highest job additions. Employment in the retail trade increased by 46,000 with clothing and clothing accessories stores providing 18,000 new jobs.The construction sector added 36,000 jobs in January with residential building providing 9,000 new jobs. Employment in financial activities, professional and technical services, and food services and drinking places increased by 32,000, 23,000 and 30,000, respectively.Wage Gains DeclineHowever, expectations that the economy is moving towards a full employment scenario weighed on workers’ pay, with average hourly wages rising only 0.1% in January, lower than December’s downwardly revised gain of 0.2%. Further, the unemployment rate, meantime, ticked up to 4.8% from 4.7% in January.The reason for the slight uptick in the unemployment rate is the increase in the number of people seeking work once again. This is borne out by a 0.2 percentage point increase in the labor force participation rate which rose to 62.9%.Meanwhile, though wage gains have been subdued last month, they have continued to occur. Average hourly earnings increased by 2.5% on a year over year basis. Wage gains are likely to pick up momentum as minimum wage norms begin to take effect. The new administration’s policies are also likely to provide a further fillip to wage increases.Our ChoicesThe slack in the labor market may be fast petering out, but some of it remains. Companies are continuing to hire at a rapid pace despite the fact that the economy is near full employment.Adding stocks from the construction, retail, financial and professional services and the restaurant sector seems to be a prudent option at this point, since they have been at the forefront of job additions. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM score. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tailored Brands, Inc.
