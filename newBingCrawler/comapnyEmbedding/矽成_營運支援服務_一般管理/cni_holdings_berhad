Our Company
How We Started
 
A homegrown company, CNI Enterprise (M) Sdn Bhd has grown in leaps and bounds over the years to become one of the largest and fastest growing direct selling companies in South East Asia.
Established in 1989, CNI offers a broad spectrum of products across 5 distinct product lines such as nutritional and health, personal care and cosmetics, food and beverages, household and auto care, and other exclusive consumer items.
The path of CNI's success can be traced to its humble beginnings in the late 1980's when three aspiring entrepreneurs teamed up to build a network marketing company with the vision to introduce a solid business plan that would enable just about anyone to start their own business with minimum capital.
What started from a dream, a vision - soon took shape and catapulted the business into one of the major players in the direct selling industry in Malaysia. In August 2005, CNI was listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia through its holding company, CNI Holdings Berhad.
