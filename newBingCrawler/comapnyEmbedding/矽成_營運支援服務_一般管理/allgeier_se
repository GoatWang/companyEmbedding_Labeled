Software Manufacturer Metasonic joins Allgeier






The Software Vendor for „Next Generation Business Software“ becomes part of the Allgeier Group
Allgeier SE strengthens its product portfolio and technology competence      
Metasonic counts on many potential synergy effects with regards to the product portfolio, project business or sales
 
Pfaffenhofen, August 11, 2014 - Metasonic joins one of the leading IT companies in the German-speaking countries and becomes part of the Allgeier Group. The software vendor can rely on a strong partner who brings along a large network of existing customers and partners, and also is equipped with broad and long-standing IT expertise.
The Allgeier Group has acquired all of the essential assets, employees, customers and partners of the software vendor Metasonic AG in Pfaffenhofen (near Munich). With this step Allgeier strengthens within the scope of its strategic focus on high-growth software solutions its product portfolio in the business group Solutions and lays a cornerstone for the further international progression to a software vendor and associated services company. With Metasonic, Allgeier continues the advancement of the Group in accordance with the Allgeier Agenda 2015. With this acquisition Allgeier emphasizes the strategy of focusing on high-growth business segments with outstanding development potential and a positive outlook for the future. “For this reason we specifically reinforce at Allgeier the development of our own software products and the building of new business areas, such as that of Business Process Management, “ says Hubert Rohrer, Member of the Management Board of Allgeier SE.
Allgeier SE is one of the leading IT companies for Business Performance. Allgeier combines the advantages of an international provider with the merits of medium-sized companies with a growth strategy oriented consistently to innovations and future trends, and an integrative business model. Operating divisions, each with their individual specialist or sector-related focal points, work together for more than 3.000 customers from almost all sectors, and of all sizes, from global Enterprises to innovative medium-sized companies. The strong-growing Group with its headquarters in Munich engages more than 5,100 salaried employees and more than 1,200 freelance IT Experts in more than 90 subsidiaries in the German-speaking countries and the rest of Europe, as well as in India, Mexico and the USA.
Within the newly formed Metasonic GmbH which belongs in its entirety (100%) to the Allgeier IT Solutions AG, the core business of Metasonic AG will be carried forward and extended internationally within the Allgeier Group by the previous Management Team led by Herbert Kindermann. „Our company vision is that one day a new form of IT-enabled organization will become a matter of course - an organization which can master the many and short-term changes and the rapidly growing complexity without jacking up IT expenditures. I am pleased that together with the Allgeier Group we can continue to pursue this vision and write the next chapters of the Metasonic success story,” says Herbert Kindermann, Managing Director of the Software Manufacturer Metasonic GmbH.
With its Metasonic Suite, Metasonic provides next generation software and a platform for agile process applications.  The basis of the Metasonic Suite is the so-called subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM). With this approach each and every user can create his or her own solutions and immediately execute them.  This can be realized in a simple manner using only a limited number of symbols, in a modeling language that closely approximates natural language with complete sentences. This leads to significant time and cost savings. As a result S-BPM differs from traditional methods, which for instance use BPMN 2.0 or BPEL, in that S-BPM increases above all the performance of the processes while reducing at the same time the complexity.  Without programming, process models that are designed with the help of the Metasonic Suite can be executed directly as an application. In addition, with this in mind Metasonic offers with Metasonic Touch a unique way to create subject-oriented-based solutions. “Our easy to use modeling table is lowering the inhibition threshold of information technology, a domain that appears highly complex to some, and encouraging communication between IT and the business departments within the company,” explains Kindermann. Users are able to move the individual, tangible modeling building blocks on the table surface, allowing them to model workflows directly. Workflows thus created are seamlessly integrated into the Metasonic Suite and can be executed immediately as a web application.
The products are marketed on a global basis and are already used successfully at a number of large international customers. Gartner, the leading worldwide Information Technology Research and Consulting Company, has named Metasonic in its 2014 Report the coveted status „Cool Vendor“ for Business Process Management Software.

Allgeier SE strengthens its product portfolio and technology competence: software manufacturer Metasonic joins Allgeier
08/11/2014Ongoing expansion of business with high-growth software solutions
Munich, 11 August 2014 – On August 01, 2014, the Allgeier Group signed an agreement to purchase the material assets, employees and customers of Metasonic AG, a software company based in Pfaffenhofen near Munich. As part of its strategic focus on high-growth software solutions, Allgeier is using the measure to strengthen its Solutions product portfolio and lay the cornerstone for its ongoing development into an international software vendor and service provider.
Metasonic previously belonged to the portfolio of T-Venture. Metasonic AG’s core business will be managed and expanded internationally by the former management team headed by Mr Herbert Kindermann under Metasonic GmbH, which will be wholly owned by the Allgeier Group. Before joining Metasonic, where he has meanwhile been active for seven years, Mr Herbert Kindermann was a member of IDS Scheer AG’s Management Board and was responsible for the company’s international business. Metasonic is a software house which offers the Metasonic® Suite comprising advanced new-generation software and a platform for dynamic process applications. The basis of the Metasonic® Suite is subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM). This BPM approach allows process workflows to be mapped expediently in one-to-one reality within a single model (for business and IT alike). It allows customers to manage and control their complex business processes in a significantly more efficient and agile way, with striking simplicity. The software is marketed on a global scale and is already used by a series of large international customers. Metasonic has recently achieved international market success with various major corporations. In its report this year, the international IT research and consultancy company Gartner awarded Metasonic the much coveted status of “Cool Vendor” for business process management software.
This transaction has enabled Allgeier to make further headway in developing the Group in accordance with the Allgeier Agenda 2015: The new addition highlights Allgeier’s overarching strategy of focusing on high-growth business areas with above-average development potential and very promising future prospects. Against this backdrop, Allgeier is concertedly strengthening the development of its own software products and building up new areas such as Business Process Management, Collaboration/SharePoint and Medical IT. Allgeier understands the development of its own intellectual property as a key competitive factor driving its current and future success which resides in the Allgeier Group’s broad-based customer portfolio with more than 3,000 customers. At the same time, the Allgeier Solutions Division is concentrating on standard business software products and solutions for leading manufacturers such as Microsoft, Infor and SAP, and is reinforcing its competence in the key trends of cloud services, IT security and datability which dominate the sector. With a view to sustaining the Group’s positive development and securing growth, Allgeier will be leveraging its capability of using the consolidation in the market by making value-creating acquisitions for the targeted expansion and acceleration of the segments’ development.

Value
 Is Allgeier SE undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 


Here we compare the current
share price of Allgeier SE to its discounted cash flow value.
The discounted cash flow value is simply looking at what the company is worth today, based on estimates of how much money it is expected to make in the future.

 The current share price of Allgeier SE is above its future cash flow value. 
Often investors are willing to pay a premium for a company that has a high dividend or the potential for future growth.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for Allgeier SE's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.

Value = Total value / Shares Outstanding (€179 / 10)
Value per share: €18.02
Current discount (share price of €22.46): -25%

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 8.96% = 1.17% + (0.883 * 8.83%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
0.883 = 0.638 (1 + (1- 21%) (48.39%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.883

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 1.17% is from the 10 year government bond rate in GB.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.
