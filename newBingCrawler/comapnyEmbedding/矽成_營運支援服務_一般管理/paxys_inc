SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

Due to the overwhelming response of our first design, the Paxis Mt. Pickett, we have now sold out! The good news is we’ve headed back to the innovation garage, made a few improvements, and are excited to announce the creation of the Paxis Twin Lakes. It’s the same Paxis technology with some enhancements to the design as well as beautiful new color offerings. We’re expecting high demand for the Twin Lakes so get on the waiting list today!

Go Back and Forth
When you have a Paxis® pack, you don’t have to take it off to get what’s inside – you can keep your straps on and swing the gear you need to the front in one swift, secure motion using the ARC swing technology.

Fishing Backpacks
Paxis is an easy access fishing backpack designed for the ultimate convenience. Quick access is made effortless with the patented articulating hinged technology and Shuttle Pod that swings around to the front of your body. LEARN MORE

 
 





Photography Backpacks
Whether you’re on location at a shoot or hiking to the top of a mountain to catch that perfect picture, Paxis is the ideal camera backpack for the photographer. LEARN MORE

 
 
 
 







 

 
 


In the world of backpacks, I’ve seen a lot of gimmicks and novelty features that are integrated with the bag that really don’t add to the overall experience or functionality. These days, you can find no shortage of backpacks with integrated mobile technology. This really just adds up to components and wires that will break down in all-weather situations, and bring little more than new ways to connect your iphone to your backpack. Not very interesting.
Paxis has done something much more. The Paxis pack was born out of Paul Vierthaler’s (Co-Founder, Paxis) desire to have a pack where he could access critical gear without the need to stop and remove the pack. He designed the articulating hinge technology – or “ARC Swing” technology that makes Paxis a unique and extremely useful design update to daypacks.

                Paxys Inc. acquires Australian outsourcing firm for A$36.7M              




 By Zinnia B. Dela Pe&ntilde;a  | Updated May 3, 2006 - 12:00am









Paxys Inc., the only call center listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange, has signed an agreement to acquire full ownership of Smart Salary Pty. Ltd., Australia&#146;s second largest outsourced remunerating packaging administration company, for A$36.7 million in cash and new shares.Under the agreement, Smart Salary has the option to receive a portion of the purchase price in new shares of stock of Paxys."Assuming that the sellers shall exercise their option to take new Paxys shares, such primary issuance will not constitute 10 percent or more of the resulting expanded outstanding capital stock," Paxys said.Smart Salary&#146;s services ensure the implementation of a well-aligned salary packaging policy and the delivery of a comprehensive tax management reporting suite. The company also provides associated services for its clients, such as financial planning, car lease finance broking and other related employee benefits.Over the last two years, Smart Salary was ranked among the top 25 companies in the Business Review Weekly&#146;s FAST 100 index of Australia&#146;s fastest growing small to medium sized companies.  It now employs almost 100 staff, across five Australian capital cities, providing high quality service to over 55,000 employees across 55 employer organizations.In the nine months of its fiscal year ending June 2006, Smart Salary has generated total revenues of A$10.2 million.In view of this announcement, the Philippine Stock Exchange suspended yesterday the trading of shares in Paxys pending submission of more details on the proposed transaction.Paxys, one of the fastest-growing call center firms in the country, reported a 176-percent growth in its net profit last year on new clients and new markets. Its net income reached P339.23 million compared with only P122.9 million a year earlier.Service income grew 115 percent to P1.4 billion from only P600 million, mainly coming from work programs from new US-based clients, which started on production in various months last year.The increase in service income is also attributable to additional services and promotions of a local client  that requires additional number of seats and to the increase in production of old clients.  From only 800 seats beginning 2004, Paxys subsidiary Advanced Contact Solutions, (ACS) ended the year 2005 with 3,000 seats.To ensure continued growth, Paxys is looking at Australia and Europe as new sites for expansion.Paxys also plans to acquire a majority stake in Global Idealogy Corp. (GIC), a leading provider of corporate mobile software applications in the domestic pharmaceutical industry.Paxys said the acquisition of GIC is intended to support its strategic intent to broaden and deepen its product and service offerings in the business processing outsourcing sector.Together with its recent investment in ScopeWorks Asia, a data transcription company, the acquisition of GIC is envisioned to complement ACS, Paxys&#146;s staple call center business.Paxys&#146; goal is not only to expand its core voice services but also to diversify into advance data services and eventually advance into IT outsourcing and other information technology solutions.
