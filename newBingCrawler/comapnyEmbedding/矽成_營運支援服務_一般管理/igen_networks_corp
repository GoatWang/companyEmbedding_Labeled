IGEN Networks Announces CEO 2016 Overview and Conference Call

MURRIETA, CALIFORNIA--(Marketwired - Jan 4, 2017) -  IGEN Networks Corporation (OTCQB:IGEN)(CSE:IGN)(CSE:IGN.CN), a Company that offers a range of proprietary, self-provisioning applications that manage and recover stolen assets, provide access to roadside assistance programs, and improve productivity of commercial fleets, announces a number of milestones and important achievements that were met in 2016. Additionally, CEO Neil Chan will hold a conference call to discuss these achievements, the condition of the Company, the current market environment for the industry, and goals for 2017 at 1:15 pm PST tomorrow, Thursday, January 5. See call instructions at the bottom of this release. 
IGEN had a record breaking year in 2016. Some of the Company's accomplishments include:

Partnership status with Verizon and IGEN's wholly-owned subsidiary Nimbo Tracking enabled the sharing of sales leads across the country, leading to record orders with thousands of new vehicle service activations and product shipments;


First pre-load implementation of Nimbo services with automotive franchise dealers, supporting multiple automotive OEM brands, and requiring all vehicles to be service activated;


Record breaking installation rate of more than 100 vehicle activations per day or 3000 vehicles over 30 days;


Record revenues and gross profits with first ever positive funds flow from operations reported in Q3 of 2016 (including deferred revenues, and therefore on a non-GAAP basis);


Launch of fleet analytics platform for consumer fleet applications 


Streamlining of distribution channels to leverage key market partner strengths including the expansion of IGEN's nationwide installation network of more than 900 installers across the United States;


Continued expansion of the Company's pre-load and conventional automotive dealer channels;


Continued investment in IGEN's IT infrastructure and product platform to support growth and provide scalability, improved functionality, stability, and performance



CEO Neil Chan stated, "IGEN is now positioned for success better than any time in its history, and as we grow we continue to focus on our goals of increasing our positive fund flow and achieving net profitability."
Mr. Chan added, "The massive market opportunity we are facing is underlined by the recent advertising program launched by Verizon for its aftermarket retail HUM device, a complementary program to our new car channels. Verizon continues to be a valuable strategic partner and contributes to our ability to land B2B contracts with dealerships. The addition of new car dealerships along with our new analytics platform for commercial fleets is increasing our ability to profitably leverage this massive market opportunity."

VANCOUVER, May 26, 2011 /PRNewswire/ - IGEN in response to the unparalleled
 demand for communications and security within related country boarders

 comprehensive mobile demonstration unit that will showcase the advanced
 proprietary and patented technologies that meets and surpasses the

 last mile data collection and security.


The unit will be a 20 foot mobile self contained demonstration trailer
 that will include two masts one with video surveillance equipment (
 thermal Cameras, Night Vision, PTZ camera, and standard vision camera)
 and the other with communication capability. It will also contain a
 weather station on the exterior and inside it will house our various
 intelligent or smart modules that will provide abilities for
 demonstration of our various smart video technologies, wall mounted
 monitors and a computer. The specific use for this unit will be for
 demonstration of our technologies through-out the US, and will include

 the company to reach out to developed nations, especially in urban
 areas (The Last Mile), who historically once enjoyed significant
 communications and related business advantages. The company has

 understands that international business will be attracted to rural
 remote locations who utilize IGEN/MachLink patented and proprietary

 connectivity to the rest of the world with reasonably priced

 for our global clients"

IGEN Portfolio Company, MachLink, Deploys Video Analytic Technology for Oil IndustryHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0IGEN Portfolio Company, MachLink, Deploys Video Analytic Technology for Oil IndustryMarketwire•October 10, 2012WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - Oct 10, 2012) -  MachLink Corporation ("MachLink"), a product portfolio company to IGEN Networks Corporation ("IGEN" or "the Company") (IGEN), the industry leading technology accelerator, has deployed its proprietary video analytics technology in a surveillance system for an oil and gas company in Fort McMurray, Alberta. This uniquely designed system enables the company to satisfy its environmental requirements by monitoring bird population patterns and ensuring bird protection, without human intervention or disruption of natural habitats.MachLink''s deployment of this proprietary technology transforms ordinary video cameras into a system of intelligent surveillance instruments. Each camera in the system network is capable of not only observing but evaluating movement - recognizing specific movement patterns and filtering out unnecessary data - and alerting workers in the case of a mission critical incident. With the use of Solar Power and German fuel cell technology, the unit is self-powered and emits only potable water as a by-product."This is a huge success for MachLink Corporation and its investors," says MachLink''s CEO and president, Fred R. Munn.
