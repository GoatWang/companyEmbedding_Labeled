PLEASE READ THE IMPORTANT NOTICES AT THE END OF THE PRESS RELEASE.

MITIE Group PLC - Acquisition of Dalkia Technical Facilities Management and Placing of approximately 6 per cent of issued share capital


Introduction

MITIE Group PLC ("MITIE" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Dalkia Energy and Technical Services Limited and Parkersell Limited (together, "Dalkia Technical Facilities Management" or, "DTFM") from Dalkia plc (the "Transaction") for a total consideration of up to £130 million on a cash and debt free basis.  The initial consideration of £120 million has been paid in cash, funded from MITIE's existing bank facilities.  

DTFM comprises the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) Commercial and Retail & Specialist divisions of Dalkia plc. DTFM is a leading provider of outsourced Technical Facilities Management and Energy and Specialist Services in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland). It has a recognisable client base which includes blue chip private and public sector clients and an experienced management team.

MITIE also announces today a fully underwritten placing of 19 million new ordinary shares (the "Placing Shares") representing approximately 6 per cent of MITIE's issued ordinary share capital immediately prior to the Placing with institutional and certain other qualifying investors to raise gross proceeds of at least £40 million (the "Placing").

Transaction highlights 



The Directors of MITIE (the "Directors") believe that the Transaction significantly enhances MITIE's service portfolio and positions the enlarged group as the strategic partner of choice for clients seeking integrated facilities management or multi-service contracts to support their property portfolios, facilities and technical assets. 





MITIE has identified a growing market opportunity to implement carbon reduction, sustainability and environmental programmes.  The Transaction represents a significant opportunity for MITIE to support this increasing client demand.





The enlarged group has combined historic revenues of approximately £1.8 billion with combined historic EBITA of approximately £91 million(1), and employs over 54,000 people. 





The Directors believe that the Transaction will deliver viable benefits through multi-service and facilities management capability enhancement, significant cross selling opportunities and cost synergies.  The annual run rate of cost synergies is expected to be in excess of £6 million by 31 March 2011. 





The Transaction is expected to enhance earnings per share in the first full year of ownership to 31 March 2011.


1 MITIE year ended 31 March 2009, Dalkia Technical Facilities Management year ended 31 December 2008
 
Ruby McGregor-Smith, Chief Executive, MITIE Group PLC, commenting on the Transaction, said:

"We are delighted to have concluded this strategically important transaction which enhances our leading position in the integrated facilities management market in the UK.  This transaction brings together MITIE's facilities management services and Dalkia's technical facilities management capabilities and strengthens our platform for sustainable profitable growth.  MITIE is now even better placed to provide our clients with facilities, property and asset management services that will assist our client in meeting the requirements of a low carbon economy. 

There will be significant opportunities for MITIE and Dalkia plc to work together in future partnerships.  We welcome all the Dalkia FM people to MITIE and are looking forward to an exciting future for the enlarged group."


Luis Pais Correia, CEO of Dalkia's Northern Europe Zone, stated: "MITIE has recognised the strength of Dalkia Technical Facilities Management and its people and will use this expertise to expand their offering to existing and new customers.  I am confident that the business will continue to develop successfully.  I look forward to working with MITIE on opportunities going forward."

Reasons for the Transaction

Enhancing MITIE's existing capability

The Directors believe that the Transaction significantly enhances MITIE's service capability and allows the enlarged group to position itself as a strategic partner for clients seeking integrated facilities management or multi-service contracts to support their property portfolios, facilities and technical assets.  The new MITIE Technical Facilities Management business will have combined revenues of £423 million. 

Viable cross-selling opportunities

DTFM has a recognisable client base, which offers viable opportunities for MITIE to cross sell additional services. In addition, Dalkia's technical facilities management expertise in areas such as Lighting, Rail and Fire Services offers the potential for MITIE to expand the scope of services that it currently provides to its client base.

Extends the energy management offering

The Transaction positions MITIE to assist its clients in meeting the demands of a low carbon economy, with its energy management offering.

Key financial information

Dalkia  financial information

In the year ended 31 December 2008, Dalkia Technical Facilities Management reported revenues of £263 million with operating profits ("EBITA") of £8.5 million and PBT of £8.5 million.  On an adjusted basis (2), EBITA was £10.1 million and EBITDA was £12.6 million.

In the year ending 31 December 2009, DTFM expects to report adjusted revenue of approximately £261 million with EBITDA of £12.3 million

As at 31 December 2008, Dalkia Technical Facilities Management had pro-forma gross assets of £86.2 million.

Dalkia Technical Facilities Management's current contracted order book stands at approximately £0.5 billion. 

Enhance earnings per share in first full year of ownership

MITIE expects the acquisition of DTFM to enhance earnings per share in the first full year of ownership to 31 March 2011.

Potential synergies

MITIE has already identified in excess of an estimated £6 million of savings per annum through potential cost synergies. These should be realised through efficiency savings across the enlarged business, leveraging MITIE's existing central functions, procurement and other efficiencies.

In addition, MITIE expects to generate a number of revenue benefits through the cross selling of MITIE services to DTFM customers and vice versa.  

Integration plans

Integration costs are expected to be in the region of £7 million, the majority of which are expected to be incurred during the course of the current financial year. 

MITIE current trading

MITIE released an Interim Management Statement on 10 July 2009 in relation to the period since 31 March 2009. At that time, the Company announced that it had made a good start to the financial year and that trading was in line with management's expectations.

The Directors confirm that there has been no material change in the Group's trading or financial position since the date of that announcement.

Details of the Transaction  

The initial consideration of £120 million is based on an expected outturn for DTFM for calendar year 2009 of £12.3 million EBITDA and has been funded from MITIE's existing bank facilities. To the extent that EBITDA for the period is in excess of £12.3 million and up to £13.3 million additional consideration of £10 million will be paid on a pro rata basis. Any such amount will be paid after the agreement of the accounts DTFM for the year ending 31 December 2009. The maximum consideration payable for the Transaction is £130 million in cash on a cash and debt free basis. There will be certain customary adjustments to the purchase price to reflect any movements in the net asset base of Dalkia Technical Facilities Management. 

2 Adjusted for management charges paid to Dalkia plc and overheads on a standalone basis
 
Details relating to the Placing  

In connection with the Transaction, MITIE also announces today that it intends to raise at least £40 million from certain institutional and other qualified investors by means of a placing of 19 million shares.  The proceeds of the Placing will be used to partly refinance the debt drawn down to satisfy the Transaction consideration.

The Placing Shares have been fully underwritten by UBS Limited ("UBS" or "UBS Investment Bank") and Investec Bank plc ("Investec", together with UBS, the "Joint Bookrunners"), subject to certain terms and conditions set out in a placing agreement entered into between the Joint Bookrunners and MITIE.

The Placing Shares will constitute less than 10 per cent of MITIE's current issued share capital. UBS and Investec are acting as Joint Bookrunners and brokers for the Placing. 

The Placing is conditional on certain matters set out in the appendix to this announcement and will be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions also set out in the appendix. The Placing will be effected by means of an accelerated bookbuild placing of the Placing Shares (the "Bookbuild Process").  The book will open with immediate effect.  The timing of the closing of the book, pricing and allocations is at the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and MITIE. Details of the price at which the Placing Shares are to be offered (the "Placing Price") will be determined and announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild Process.

The Placing Shares will be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each in the capital of MITIE, including the right to receive all future dividends and other distributions.

Application will be made for the Placing Shares to be admitted to the Official List maintained by the UK Listing Authority and to be admitted to trading by the London Stock Exchange plc on its main market for listed securities ("Admission"). Admission of and dealings in the Placing Shares are expected to take place at 8.00 am (London) on 17 August 2009.

Each participant in the Placing will represent, warrant and acknowledge that, unless otherwise agreed, it is outside the United States and is subscribing for the Placing Shares in an "offshore transaction" within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

Details of the Placing Agreement and the Placing Shares 
Pursuant to a placing agreement between UBS, Investec and the Company (the "Placing Agreement"), each of the Joint Bookrunners has, on the terms and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and undertakings given by the Company in the Placing Agreement, undertaken to use its reasonable endeavours to act as agent for and on behalf of the Company to procure Placees for the Placing Shares and has undertaken to underwrite the Placing Shares in equal proportion with the other Joint Bookrunner. 
The issue of the Placing Shares is to be effected by way of a cash box placing.
The Placing Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued ordinary shares of 2.5 pence per share in the capital of the Company, with the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such ordinary shares after the date of issue of the Placing Shares. 
The Company, subject to certain exceptions, has agreed not to allot, issue or grant any rights in respect of any of its ordinary shares in the period from the date of this Announcement until 90 days after Admission without the Joint Bookrunners' prior consent.

Application for listing and admission to trading 
Application will be made to the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the Placing Shares to be admitted, respectively, to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on its main market for listed securities (together "Admission"). It is expected that Admission will take place on or before 17 August 2009 and that dealings in the Placing Shares on the main market for listed securities of London Stock Exchange plc will commence at the same time. 
The Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will not be admitted to trading on any stock exchange other than the London Stock Exchange plc.
Bookbuilding Process 
Commencing today, UBS and Investec will be conducting an accelerated bookbuilding process (the "Bookbuilding Process") to determine demand for participation in the Placing by the Placees. This appendix gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the Placing. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any Placing Shares. 
The Joint Bookrunners and the Company will be entitled to effect the Placing by such alternative method to the Bookbuilding Process as they may, in their sole discretion, determine.
Participation in, and principal terms of, the Bookbuilding Process 
The Joint Bookrunners are arranging the Placing as agent for and on behalf of the Company. Participation in the Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited by UBS or Investec to participate. 
By participating in the Bookbuilding Process and the Placing, Placees will be deemed to have read and understood this announcement (including this appendix) in its entirety and to be participating and making an offer for Placing Shares on the terms and conditions, and to be providing the representations, warranties, acknowledgements and undertakings, contained in this appendix. 
Persons who are eligible to participate in the Bookbuilding Process and the Placing should communicate their bid by telephone to their usual sales contact at UBS or Investec. Each bid should state the number of shares in the Company which a prospective Placee wishes to acquire or the total monetary amount which it is offering to subscribe. Bids may be scaled down by the Joint Bookrunners on the basis referred to below. 
Each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective Affiliates (as defined below) are entitled to participate as principal in the Bookbuilding Process. 
The obligations of a Placee will be owed by the Placees to the Company and to each of the Joint Bookrunners through whom the Placee submitted its bid. 
The Bookbuilding Process will establish a single price (the "Placing Price") payable to UBS or Investec, as appropriate, by all Placees. The Placing Price and the aggregate proceeds to be raised through the Placing will be agreed between UBS, Investec and the Company following completion of the Bookbuilding Process and any discount to the market price of the Placing Shares will be determined in accordance with the Listing Rules. The Company will make a further announcement on a Regulatory Information Service ("RIS") following the close of the Bookbuilding Process detailing the Placing Price (the "Pricing Announcement").  
The timing of the closing of the books, pricing and allocations is at the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and the Company. The Joint Bookrunners and the Company may, at their sole discretion, accept bids that are received after the Bookbuilding Process has closed. The Joint Bookrunners and the Company reserve the right to reduce or seek to increase the amount to be raised at their sole discretion. 
A bid in the Bookbuilding Process will be made on the terms and conditions in this appendix and, except with UBS's or Investec's consent, will not be capable of variation or revocation after the time at which it is submitted. 
To the fullest extent permissible by law, neither of the Joint Bookrunners nor any of their respective holding companies, subsidiaries, branches or associated undertakings or any subsidiary, branch, affiliate or associated undertaking of any such holding company nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees (each an "Affiliate") shall have any liability to Placees (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise). In particular, each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective Affiliates shall not have any liability (including, to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of its conduct of the Bookbuilding Process or of such alternative method of effecting the Placing as the Joint Bookrunners and the Company may agree. 
If successful, each Placee's allocation of Placing Shares, and the Placing Price, will be confirmed to Placees orally by the Joint Bookrunner through whom the placee submitted its bid as soon as practicable following the close of the Bookbuilding Process and a conditional advice note will be dispatched as soon as practicable thereafter. A Joint Bookrunner's oral confirmation to any such Placee will constitute a legally binding commitment upon such Placee, in favour of UBS or Investec, as appropriate, and the Company, to acquire the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price on the terms and conditions set out in this appendix and in accordance with the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association. 
Each Placee will have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to UBS or Investec, as appropriate, to pay to it (or as it may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares such Placee has agreed to acquire. 
All obligations under the Placing will be subject to the fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under "Conditions of the Placing" and to the Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under "Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement". 
Conditions of the Placing 
The Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. 
Each of the Joint Bookrunners obligations under the Placing Agreement are, and the Placing is, conditional on, inter alia: 


the publication by the Company of the Announcement (as defined in the Placing Agreement) through a Regulatory Information Service by no later than 7.00 a.m. on the date of the Placing Agreement (or such later date and/or time as the Joint Bookrunners may in their absolute discretion determine in consultation with the Company);


the publication by the Company of the Final Press Announcement (as defined in the Placing Agreement) through a Regulatory Information Service by no later than 6.00 p.m. on the date of the Placing Agreement (or such later date and/or time as the Joint Bookrunners may in their absolute discretion determine in consultation with the Company);


the representations and warranties given by the Company in the Placing Agreement (the "Warranties") being true, accurate and not misleading as at: (i) the date of the Placing Agreement; and (ii) the Closing Date (as defined in the Placing Agreement), by reference to the circumstances at the relevant time and no matter having arisen on or prior to Admission (as defined in the Placing Agreement) which might reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim under the Placing Agreement;


the Company being in compliance with its obligations under the Placing Agreement which are required to be performed or satisfied on or prior to Admission and the terms and conditions of the Placing, save to the extent that any non-compliance is not material in the context of the Placing and/or Admission;


by no later than 7.00 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Joint Bookrunners having received the Closing Opinions (as defined in the Placing Agreement) dated as of the Closing Date;


by not later than 7.00 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Joint Bookrunners having received a certificate of an authorised representative of the Company in the form set out in the Placing Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date;


Admission occurring not later than 8.00 a.m. on the Closing Date (or such later date and/or time as the Joint Bookrunners and the Company may agree);


the Company allotting, subject only to Admission, the Placing Shares to the Placees or the Joint Bookrunners (as the case may be) in accordance with the Placing Agreement;


The Joint Bookrunners receiving certain documents at or as soon as practicable after execution of the Placing Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Placing Agreement;


each of the JerseyCo Agreements (as defined in the Placing Agreement) having been duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto on or prior to execution of the Placing Agreement and being in full force and effect and there having occurred no default or material breach by the Company or JerseyCo (as defined in the Placing Agreement) of the terms of such agreements immediately prior to Admission; and


the agreement between the Company and Dalkia plc in connection with the proposed acquisition by the Company of Dalkia energy and Technical Services Limited and Parkersell Limited (the "Acquisition") having become unconditional in all respects on or prior to execution of the Placing Agreement and being in full force and effect and there having occurred no default or breach by any party thereto on or before Admission and such agreement not having been varied, modified, supplemented, rescinded or terminated in whole or in part (save to the extent that the Joint Bookrunners have consented in writing to such variation, modification or supplementation) and the Company having not failed to enforce its rights thereunder in accordance with its terms or granted any waiver or indulgence in relation to any obligation thereunder or extension of time for its performance, (save to the extent that the Joint Bookrunners have consented to any such action) which in any case is, in the opinion of the Joint Bookrunners (acting reasonably), material in the context of the Placing and/or Admission.


If the conditions in the Placing Agreement are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the Placing Agreement within the stated time periods (or such later time and/or date as the Joint Bookrunners may in their absolute discretion agree in consultation with the Company), or the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Placing will lapse and the Placees' rights and obligations shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by or on behalf of the Placee (or any person on whose behalf the placee is acting) in respect thereof. 
By participating in the Bookbuilding Process, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations cease and terminate only in these circumstances and under "Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement" below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it after oral confirmation from UBS or Investec, as appropriate, following the close of the Bookbuilding Process. 
The Joint Bookrunners may, in their absolute discretion and upon such terms as it thinks fit, waive compliance or extend the time and/or date for fulfilment by the Company with the whole or any part of certain of the Company's obligations in relation to the conditions in the Placing Agreement. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees' commitments as set out in this appendix. 
None of UBS, Investec, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision any of them may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision any of them may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally. 
Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement 
The Joint Bookrunners may, in their absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company terminate the Placing Agreement at any time prior to Admission if, inter alia:

any statement contained in the Placing Documents (as defined in the Placing Agreement) has become or been discovered to be untrue, inaccurate or misleading, or any matter has arisen which would, if any of the Placing Documents were to be issued at that time, constitute a material omission therefrom;


in the opinion of the Joint Bookrunners (acting in good faith), there has been a Material Adverse Change (as defined in the Placing Agreement) (whether or not foreseeable at the date of the Placing Agreement);


any of the conditions set out in the Placing Agreement (detailed above) is not satisfied or waived by the Joint Bookrunners or if any matter or circumstance, arises as a result of which it is reasonable to expect that any of the conditions will not be satisfied at the required time(s) and continue to be satisfied at Admission;

If the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the rights and obligations of each Placee in respect of the Placing as described in this announcement (including this appendix) shall cease and terminate at such time and no claim can be made by any Placee in respect thereof. 
By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees with the Company, UBS and Investec that the exercise by the Company, UBS or Investec of any right of termination or any other right or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Company, UBS or Investec (as the case may be) and that neither the Company, UBS nor Investec need make any reference to such Placee and that neither the Company, UBS nor Investec nor any of their Affiliates shall have any liability to such Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) whatsoever in connection with any such exercise. 
No Prospectus 
No prospectus or other offering document has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FSA, or by the competent authority in any other jurisdiction, in relation to the Placing and Placees' commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this announcement (including this appendix) and the Pricing Announcement. Each Placee, by participating in the Bookbuilding Process and, if relevant, the Placing, confirms that it has neither received nor relied on any information, representation, warranty or statement made by or on behalf of UBS, Investec or the Company other than the content of this announcement (including this appendix) and the Pricing Announcement and neither UBS, Investec nor the Company nor any person acting on such person's behalf nor any of their holding companies, subsidiaries, branches, affiliates or associated undertakings or any subsidiary, branch, affiliate or associated undertaking of any such holding company nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees, has or shall have any liability for any Placee's decision to participate in the Bookbuilding Process and, if relevant, the Placing, based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement including (but not limited to) any publicly available or filed information. Each Placee acknowledges, agrees and warrants that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in deciding whether to participate in the Bookbuilding Process and, if relevant, the Placing. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation. 
Registration and Settlement 
Settlement of transactions in the Placing Shares following Admission will take place within the CREST system, subject to certain exceptions. UBS, Investec and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for, and delivery to Placees of, the Placing Shares by such other means as they deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not practicable within the CREST system within the timetable set out in this announcement and appendix or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in any Placee's jurisdiction. 
Each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing will be sent a conditional advice note stating the number of Placing Shares allocated to it, the Placing Price and the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to UBS or Investec, as appropriate. In agreeing to acquire the number of Placing Shares set out in the conditional advice note, such Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with either the standing CREST instructions or the certificated settlement instructions which it has in place with UBS or Investec, as appropriate. 
Settlement through CREST will be on a T+3 basis unless otherwise notified by the Joint Bookrunners. 
Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of 2 percentage points above prevailing LIBOR as determined by the Joint Bookrunners. 
Each Placee is deemed to agree that if it does not comply with these obligations, UBS or Investec as appropriate, may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to it on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for its own account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee's behalf. 
Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.  
No participant will be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Placing. 
If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the conditional advice note is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation.

Stamp, registration, documentary, transfer and similar taxes or duties payable outside the UK will be the responsibility of the relevant Placee and the Placee, or the Placee's nominee, in respect of whom (or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such non-UK stamp, registration, documentary, transfer or similar taxes or duties undertakes to pay such taxes and duties forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company, UBS and Investec in the event that either the Company, UBS or Investec has incurred any such liability to such taxes or duties. 
This announcement has been issued by the Company and is the sole responsibility of the Company.

Investec, which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FSA, is acting for the Company and no-one else in connection with the Placing and other matters referred to in this announcement, and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to its clients nor for providing advice in relation to the Placing or any other matter referred to in this announcement. 
When a Placee or person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with UBS or Investec, as appropriate, any money held in an account with UBS or Investec, as appropriate, on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money (within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the FSA made under FSMA) which, therefore, will not require UBS or Investec, as appropriate, to segregate such money, as that money will be held by it under a banking relationship and not as a trustee. 
Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser. Each Placee and each person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges that neither of UBS nor Investec nor any of their respective Affiliates, is making any recommendations to it, advising it regarding the suitability of any transactions it may enter into in connection with the Placing nor providing advice in relation to the Placing nor in respect of any warranties, representations, undertakings or indemnities contained in the Placing Agreement nor the exercise or performance of any of the Joint Bookrunner's rights and obligations thereunder including any rights to waive or vary any conditions or exercise any termination rights. 
All times and dates in this announcement may be subject to amendment. UBS or Investec, as appropriate, shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any changes.
