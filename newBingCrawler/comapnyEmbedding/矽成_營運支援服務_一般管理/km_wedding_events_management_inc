Being an unorganized industry, the industry consists of a wide spectrum of
service providers. Each service provider focuses on one or a few services
required for a wedding. Hence, there are not many organized players who focus on
a wide range of services similar to the services offered by KM.

There are various wedding halls, which enable the customers to identify wedding
contractors. Similarly, the wedding contractors who are mainly focusing on
providing food for the occasion also enable arrangement of other logistic
support including decoration, flowers, etc. Another category that is being used
is the star hotels for a “reception” for a wedding, which covers all the
requirements. This generally covers the hall (banquet hall), food, decorations,
services, etc.

A comparison chart across various organized players and major categories of
players is as follows:

Name             Matrimony Wedding Planning Event Management Event Infra
KM               Strong    Medium           Strong           Medium     
Bharat Matrimony Strong    No               No               No         
Shaadi.com       Strong    No               No               No         
Times matrimony  Strong    No               No               No         
Event Managers   No        No               Strong           No         
Wedding Halls    No        No               No               Strong     

Thus, while there is competition in each of the segments, the focus of KM is to
provide a wide range of services from matrimony to event infrastructure and
event management to create a new benchmark for an organized and comprehensive
service provider in this industry.


Company Description
KM Wedding Events Management, Inc. (the “Company” or “KM”) was incorporated in
the State of Delaware on October 24, 2012.

On February 14, 2013, KM entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with KM
Matrimony Pvt Ltd, a company incorporated under the 1956 Companies Act of India
(“KM India”), pursuant


 to which KM agreed to purchase ten million (10,000,000)
shares of KM India’s common stock at a price of 11 Indian Rupees (approximately
$0.21 USD) per share for an aggregate purchase price of up to two million one
hundred thousand dollars ($2,100,000 USD) dollars. As of February 21, 2014,
pursuant to the above agreement, KM has purchased 1,393,127 shares at 11 Rupees
per share ($0.201 USD at the time of the sale) in KM India on April 3, 2013 for
$280,000 USD.  

On February 14, 2013, KM entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the
shareholders of KM India, comprised of Mr. Venkatesan Vaidhyanathan, Mrs. Meera
Nagarajan, Mr. Sridhar Kalyanasundaram, Mr. Vijaya Bhaskar Venkatesan and Mrs.
Nithya Vijaya Baskar, pursuant to which KM shall purchase Three Million One
Hundred and Fifty Thousand (3,150,000) shares of KM India’s common stock from
Mr. Venkatesan Vaidhyanathan, Mrs. Meera Nagarajan, Mr. Sridhar Kalyanasundaram,
Mr. Vijaya Bhaskar Venkatesan and Mrs. Nithya Vijaya Baskar payable in two
tranches as follows: (i) Tranche A: One Million One Hundred and Fifty Thousand
(1,150,000) shares of KM India’s common stock at a purchase price of 11 Indian
Rupees ($0.21 USD) per share (“Tranche A”); and, (ii) Tranche B: Two Million
(2,000,000) shares of KM India’s common stock at a purchase price equal to the
fair market value of KM India’s shares at the time of purchase (“Tranche B”). As
of February 21, 2014, KM has purchased 1,120,018 shares in KM India on April 26,
2013 from Tranche A for an aggregate of $229,000 USD from two of the
shareholders of KM India viz. Mr. Venkatesan Vaidhyanathan (562,455 shares for
$115,000 USD) and Mrs. Meera Nagarajan (557,564 shares for $114,000 USD). The
remaining Tranche A shares and the Tranche B shares have to be sold within 3
years from February 14, 2013. 

As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreements referenced above, KM now carries on
the business of KM India as its primary business and KM India is a subsidiary of
KM. KM currently holds 55.32% of KM India.

KM India has been involved in the wedding services industry in South India since
2004. KM is the brand, which is a short form for ‘Kalyana Malai’ meaning
‘Wedding Garland’ in South Indian language. The services offered by KM India
include Matrimonial (Matchmaking) Services and Wedding Services. Unless
otherwise specified, KM and KM India shall hereinafter be collectively referred
to as “KM” or the “Company”.

KM’s Matrimonial Services include matchmaking and partner identification,
through multiple delivery channels viz. print and visual media, website,
physical centers and events. The Wedding Services of KM covers 15 different
services, including food and beverages, guest services, decorations, event
planning and event management. In order to increase the Wedding Services
business, KM intends to lease and/or own wedding halls (physical infrastructures
where a wedding is conducted, similar to banquet halls of hotels) and provide
Wedding Services for the weddings conducted in these halls.

KM currently focuses on the geographic locations of Tamil Nadu and Andhra
Pradesh (two of the Southern States in India). We believe that the Company is
well positioned to exploit the potential of the Wedding Services market because
of its presence in this market since 2004 and respected brand name. The Company
is also planning to expand its services in the United States during 2014. KM’s
target customers include the Indian high-income group, higher middle-income
group, and other affluent individuals both in the U.S. and India. This segment,
being upwardly mobile and comfort and service focused, is the right target group
for the business positioning of KM.

KM India has been servicing the Indian Diaspora in the United States through its
website since 2004 which was followed up by Community Meets (events focused on
bringing together individuals who are seeking a life partner and who share
similar backgrounds (e.g. profession, socio-economic background, religion, etc.)
conducted during the fiscal year 2011 in 5 cities (New York City, South Windsor
(Connecticut), Boston, Houston & San Antonio) which was attended by around 1,200
prospective matrimonial customers. In October 2013, KM India also filmed for Sun
TV across 6 different US cities (New York, South Windsor Connecticut), New
Brunswick, San Jose, Dallas and Houston), which was attended by over 5,400 South
Indian community members. KM’s TV show is a 30 minute matrimonial-related
program produced by KM and telecast once a week by Sun TV. The TV program
introduces profiles of individuals seeking to be matched and also incorporates
an entertainment based “debate show” which covers various “topics of social
impact” which are discussed and debated upon by professionals & experts.

Based on the experience gained from the above activities, KM believes that the
Indian Diaspora in the United States presents a lucrative market that requires
Matrimonial and Wedding Services offered by KM but also requires a customized
and focused approach for exploiting the same. The plan for exploring this
business opportunity includes setting up offices in the U.S. (fiscal 2014),
providing Wedding Services for weddings to be conducted in India by Indians in
the U.S. (fiscal 2014), launching a customized website for Matrimonial Services
in the U.S. market (fiscal 2015) and providing Wedding Services for conducting
weddings locally in the United States (fiscal 2016-17).
