BOSTON – May 2, 2016 – Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the global leader in storage and information management services, today announced the completion of its acquisition of Recall Holdings Limited as a primarily stock transaction for approximately $2 billion (US). With the acquisition, Iron Mountain acquires the entirety of Recall’s global operations, including all facilities, vehicles, employees and customer assets and excluding operations to be divested in accordance with regulatory agreements in the United States, Canada and Australia; the acquisition of the Recall business in the UK remains subject to regulatory review. Additionally, Iron Mountain appointed Recall directors Neil Chatfield and Wendy Murdock to its Board of Directors, who are included among director nominees standing for election at the company’s upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 17, 2016.
Increasing regulations, ongoing security threats, and the need to turn data into business value has elevated both the complexity and priority of managing information and assets. From business records to data to valuable items like art, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected while able to be accessed immediately. They require a partner located where they are with the right combination of trust and security to protect what matters most, while also providing expertise and product and services designed to get the most out of those assets. And they need to be sure that as their business matures and changes, their partner can scale with them – supporting their growth across geographies and into new industries.
“Today marks an important milestone for Iron Mountain, and we welcome our new colleagues from Recall as well as their customers and shareholders into our company,” said William L. Meaney, president and CEO of Iron Mountain. “This acquisition significantly boosts our vision to serve as the trusted guardians of our customers’ most important assets, as it expands both our services and footprint for better assisting them with their storage and information management needs. That trust is a cornerstone of our business, whether it’s securing the strategic value of information and assets or continuing to develop innovative products and services that give customers improved access, control and value from those assets. We’re now strongly positioned to deliver on our strategic and financial goals, drawing on the combined capabilities and expertise of both companies to ensure a superior customer experience across the globe.”

	      Recall of Chinese medicine product (with photo)

	    ***********************************************

	         The Department of Health (DH) today (May 7) urged members of the public not to buy or take three batches of a Chinese medicine product  called Royal Medic No.1 Chinese Caterpillar Fungus (±sÃÄ°ó¦èÂÃÀY´Á³¥¥Í¯Â¥VÂÎ®L¯ó) as the microbial content were found to have exceeded the maximum permitted limit.     A DH spokesman said the wholesaler, Royal Medic (Holdings) Ltd. (±sÃÄ°ó(±±ªÑ)¦³­­¤½¥q), was instructed to recall the product from market and to surrender them to DH. The concerned lot numbers are RM 630021, RM 630023 and RM 6300026.     "Under pCm registration system in Hong Kong, a product must fulfill, among other things, requirement for microbial limits. The microbial count is an indicator of hygiene standard.      "The Department has not received any report of adverse drug reactions linked to the product so far," he added.     Members of the public who have purchased the concerned batch of the product are advised to stop using it, dispose of or surrender it to the Pharmaceutical Service of DH at 3/F, Public Health Laboratory Centre, 382 Nam Cheong Street, Kowloon during office hours.     The DH investigation came after the receipt of a report regarding a number of Chinese medicine products of Caterpillar Fungus (¥VÂÎ®L¯ó) in the market.       DH took samples of the related products from the market for testing and found that the bacterial count of the Royal Medic No.1 Chinese Caterpillar Fungus exceeds the permitted limit.          Members of the public can call the wholesaler's hotline at 2877 8866 for matters related to recall of the product.      DH has also set up a telephone enquiry service at 2319 5119 for members of the public during office hours.
