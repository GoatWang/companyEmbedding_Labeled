News Release
Mitsufuji announces a capital and business partnership with Artra Corporation




Mitsufuji Corporation (Head office: Seika-cho, Kyoto; CEO: Ayumu Mitera)(“Mitsufuji”) signed a contract today with Artra Corporation(Stock code: 6029; head office: Osaka; CEO: Hiroyuki Kyuse)(“Artra”) forming a capital and business partnership.
Celebrating the 60th anniversary of its Nishijin-ori factory, Mitsufuji’s conductive “AGposs®” fibers were developed through traditional Kyoto techniques. AGposs® is used by major textile companies, electronics manufacturers, and wearable ventures to create smart wear products both domestically and overseas.
With a corporate philosophy of “helping people around the world stay healthy,” Artra brings know-how and experience gained through its global enterprises and developments. Together, the two companies will develop and market products with the goal of a healthier society. 
Partnership outline:
The allotments of new shares and second stock acquisition rights issued today will be allocated to Artra. This allotment will total 200 million JPY and is to be used chiefly as capital for research toward the shared development of products to be ready for market within 3 years. Both companies will work toward market expansion through use of combined sales networks, marketing directed at Artra customers, and additional efforts.
Through this type of sales and marketing cycle, data collected from customer experiences will be used by development departments to aid in the creation of new products. Along with establishing analytical techniques using AI and big data critical to the future wearables market, both companies will work together to develop the algorithms necessary for gaining feedback from data.

As  discussed  in  Note  9 to the  Company's  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements  for the quarter ended March 31, 1999 and in Form 8-K dated April 19,

the buyer's and seller's due diligence  and  negotiation  of a definitive  asset
purchase agreement. The letter of intent, as extended, expires on June 11, 1999.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The following  discussion  supplements  the  information  found in the financial
statements and related notes:



Results of Operations



We  significantly  changed the business  focus of the company  during the fourth
quarter  of fiscal  year  1998.  We exited our then one  industry  segment,  the
packaging products business,  conducted by the discontinued Bagcraft subsidiary.
We are actively  investigating  new  business  opportunities  starting  with the
Entrade transaction  discussed below. Our consolidated  financial statements for
the  three  months  ended  March  31,  1998  have  been  reclassified  to report
separately the results of operations of the Bagcraft  subsidiary in discontinued
operations.


Three Months Ended March 31, 1999 vs. Three Months Ended March 31, 1998
Continuing Operations


Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses from continuing  operations were
$1,354,000 for the three months ended March 31, 1999 as compared to $622,000 for
the three  months  ended March 31, 1998.  We incurred a  compensation  charge of
$300,000  during the first quarter of 1999 relating to stock options  granted to
certain   individuals   employed   to  manage  our  entry   into  the   Internet
business-to-business  e-commerce  and  on-line  auction  business  and  also had
$433,000 of losses incurred by Entrade.


During the three  months ended March 31,  1999,  we had net  interest  income of
$86,000 as  compared  to net  interest  expense of  $1,134,000  during the three
months ended March 31, 1998. We used a significant  portion of the cash proceeds
received from the November 1998 sale of the assets of the discontinued  Bagcraft
subsidiary  to pay  off  borrowings  on our  various  loan  agreements.  We have
invested a substantial portion of the remaining net proceeds in interest bearing
cash equivalents.


We were  unable to  recognize  an income  tax  benefit  in  connection  with the
company's   1999  and  1998  pre-tax  losses  due  to  the  company's  tax  loss
carryforwards and the uncertainty of future taxable income.



Discontinued Operations



During the three months ended March 31, 1998,  we incurred a loss of $138,000 at
the discontinued Bagcraft subsidiary.





Liquidity and Capital Resources




Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital



Our cash and cash equivalents decreased $2,436,000 during the three months ended
March 31, 1999.  Cash flows used by operating  activities of $2,074,000 and cash
flows  used by  investing  activities  of  $1,652,000  exceeded  cash flows from
financing activities of $1,290,000. Operating activities used cash flows to fund
the  Company's  net  loss  for the  quarter  ended  March  31,  1999  and to pay
liabilities of the discontinued  Bagcraft subsidiary.  Investing activities used
cash flows for our investment in and advances to Entrade.  Financing  activities
provided cash flows from the exercise of stock options and warrants.


Our  consolidated  working capital  decreased to $3,760,000 at March 31, 1999 as
compared to consolidated  working capital of $6,813,000 at December 31, 1998. We
used  working  capital  to  pay of  liabilities  of  the  discontinued  Bagcraft
subsidiary and for our investment in and advances to Entrade.


1






Operating Plan



On February 23, 1999, we entered into a merger  agreement  with WWWX and Entrade
Inc. ("Entrade", formerly NA Acquisition Corp.), a 90% owned subsidiary of WWWX.
As a result of the merger agreement, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Entrade,  and the  shareholders  of the  company  will  become  shareholders  of
Entrade.  Under the terms of the merger  agreement,  the company's  shareholders
will receive one share of Entrade common stock in exchange for each share of the
company's common stock.  Additionally,  the ARTRA preferred stock  shareholders,
which shall  include  persons who elect to exchange  their BCA  preferred  stock
prior to the merger, will receive shares of Entrade common stock in exchange for
shares of their  respective  preferred  stock  issuances.  All stock options and
warrants issued by the company and outstanding on the closing date of the Merger
will be converted into Entrade stock options and warrants.


Entrade  owns  all  of  the  outstanding  capital  stock  of  entrade.com,  Inc.
("entrade.com")  and 25% of the  Class A  Common  Stock of  asseTrade.com,  Inc.
("asseTrade.com").


entrade.com is an Internet  business-to-business  e-commerce  company seeking to
provide  asset  disposition  solutions  for the  utility  and  large  industrial
manufacturing   sectors.   asseTrade.com   proposes  to  develop  and  implement
comprehensive  asset/inventory  recovery,  disposal,  remarketing and management
solutions for corporate  clients through advanced Internet  electronic  business
applications, including on-line auctions.


In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,  on February 23, 1999,
Entrade  acquired  certain  software  and  intellectual  property and 25% of the
shares  of  Class A Voting  Common  Stock of  asseTrade.com  (collectively,  the
"Purchased  Assets")  from WWWX,  in exchange  for  1,800,000  shares of Entrade
Common  Stock,  $800,000  in cash  and a note  for  $500,000,  payable  upon the
consummation of the Merger or the earlier  termination of the Merger  Agreement.
On February 19, 1999, Entrade had agreed with Energy Trading Company ("ETCO"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Peco Energy Company,  to issue to ETCO 200,000 shares
of Entrade  Common  Stock,  and to pay ETCO  $100,000  in  exchange  for certain
retained rights ETCO held in the Purchased Assets. Entrade also agreed with both
WWWX and ETCO that it would  provide a minimum  of  $4,000,000  in  funding  for
entrade.com.  Under separate loan agreements, ARTRA agreed to loan Entrade up to
$2,000,000 to fund the $800,000 cash payment to WWWX and to provide  funding for
entrade.com  until the consummation of the Merger or the earlier  termination of
the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to guaranty
the $4,000,000 funding for entrade.com if the Merger is consummated.


Consummation  of the merger is subject to the  approval of the  shareholders  of
ARTRA. The Company expects to complete the transaction  during the third quarter
of 1999.


The company has  adequate  funds  available  to fund its  obligations  under the
merger agreement and to fund entrade.com's operations for the remainder of 1999.



Capital Expenditures



ARTRA's corporate entity has no material commitments for capital expenditures.



Investment in COMFORCE Corporation



ARTRA,  along with its wholly  owned  Fill-Mor  subsidiary,  owns a  significant
minority interest in COMFORCE Corporation ("COMFORCE"),  consisting of 1,525,500
shares or  approximately  9% of the  outstanding  common stock of COMFORCE as of
December 31, 1998 with an aggregate value as of that date of $8,200,000.


The COMFORCE shares constitute  unregistered securities under the Securities Act
of 1933 (the "Act"). As a result of ARTRA's former involvement in the operations
and  management of COMFORCE,  ARTRA was  considered an  "affiliate"  of COMFORCE
under the Act,  and because of this,  the number of shares that ARTRA could sell
without  registration  under the Act within any three-month  period was limited.
For the reasons set forth below,  the Company  believes  that an exemption  from
registration under Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Act is now available to it,
and therefore the limitations  under Rule 144 on the number of restricted shares
that ARTRA could sell within any three-month period without registrations are no
longer applicable to it.


2





There can be no assurance  that the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  would
concur with our  position.  Notwithstanding  this,  we do not  believe  that our
ability to sell  COMFORCE  shares,  or eventually to realize on the value of our
COMFORCE shares, will be affected in a material adverse way, although we may not
be able to sell our  COMFORCE  shares as  quickly  as we could if we were to use
Rule 144(k), and in any event, an attempt to sell a large number of our COMFORCE
shares over a limited  period  could be expected to result in a reduction in the
value of such shares.


In January 1996, our Board of Directors  approved the sale of 200,000 of ARTRA's
COMFORCE common shares to certain officers, directors and key employees of ARTRA
for non-interest  bearing notes totaling $400,000.  The notes are collateralized
by the related  COMFORCE common shares.  Additionally,  the noteholders have the
right to put their COMFORCE  shares back to ARTRA in full payment of the balance
of their notes.  Based upon the preceding  factors,  we have concluded that, for
reporting  purposes,  we have  effectively  sold  options to  certain  officers,
directors and key employees to acquire  200,000 of our COMFORCE  common  shares.
Accordingly,  in January 1996 these 200,000  COMFORCE common shares were removed
from the our portfolio of "Available-for-sale securities" and were classified in
the our  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  as other  receivables  with an
aggregate  value of  $400,000,  based upon the value of  proceeds to be received
upon future exercise of the options.  The disposition of these 200,000  COMFORCE
common shares resulted in a gain that was deferred and will not be recognized in
the our  financial  statements  until the  options  to  purchase  these  200,000
COMFORCE common shares are exercised.  During the first quarter of 1998, options
to acquire 14,000 of these COMFORCE common shares were exercised  resulting in a
realized gain of $53,000.  At March 31, 1999, options to acquire 55,750 COMFORCE
common  shares  remained  unexercised  and  were  classified  in  our  condensed
consolidated  balance  sheet as other  receivables  with an  aggregate  value of
$112,000,  based upon the value of proceeds to be received upon future  exercise
of the options.



Redeemable Preferred Stock



As discussed in Note 4 to our condensed  consolidated  financial statements,  we
have outstanding  redeemable preferred stock with a carrying value of $2,921,000
at March 31,  1999.  Certain  redeemable  preferred  stock issues of the BCA and
Bagcraft subsidiaries are included in liabilities of discontinued  operations at
March 31, 1999.


Under the terms of the Merger Agreement with WWWX and Entrade (See Note 2 to our
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements),  if approved  by the  Company's
shareholders,  the ARTRA  preferred  stock  shareholders,  which  shall  include
persons  who elect to exchange  their BCA  preferred  stock for ARTRA  preferred
stock  prior to the  merger,  will  receive  shares of Entrade  Common  Stock in
exchange for shares of their respective preferred stock issuances.



Litigation



We are the defendants in various  business-related  litigation and environmental
matters. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. At March
31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, we had accrued current liabilities of $1,500,000
for potential business-related  litigation and environmental liabilities.  While
these  litigation  and  environmental  matters  involve wide ranges of potential
liability,  we do not believe the outcome of these  matters will have a material
adverse effect on the our financial statements.



Net Operating Loss Carryforwards



At  December  31,  1998,  we  had  Federal  income  tax  loss  carryforwards  of
approximately  $10,000,000  expiring principally in 2010 - 2012, available to be
applied against future taxable  income,  if any. In recent years, we have issued
shares of our common stock to repay various debt  obligations,  upon exercise of
stock options and warrants,  as consideration for acquisitions,  to fund working
capital obligations and as consideration for various other transactions. Section
382 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 limits a corporation's  utilization of
its Federal income tax loss  carryforwards when certain changes in the ownership
of a corporation's common stock occurs. In our opinion, we not currently subject
to such  limitations  regarding the  utilization  of its Federal income tax loss
carryforwards. Should we continue to issue a significant number of shares of our
common  stock,  it could  trigger a  limitation  on our  ability to utilize  our
Federal income tax loss carryforwards.


3






Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices



Inflation has become a less significant factor in our economy;  however,  to the
extent permitted by competition, we have generally passed increased costs to our
customers by increasing sales prices over time.



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



In June  1998,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement  establishes  accounting and
reporting standards for derivative  instruments and requires  recognition of all
derivatives  as assets or  liabilities  in the balance sheet and  measurement of
those  instruments  at fair value.  The  statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. We have not determined what impact this standard,
when adopted, will have on the our financial statements.



Year 2000 Compliance



The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue refers to the  inability of many  computer  programs
and systems to process  accurately  dates later than  December 31, 1999.  Unless
these  programs  are  modified  to handle the century  change,  they will likely
interpret the Year 2000 as the year 1900. We anticipate that the Year 2000 Issue
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial  position or results of
operations.  We have not incurred any  significant  costs for Y2K  compliance to
date and do not expect to incur any  significant  additional  costs to  complete
such compliance.  Additionally,  we believe the technology and internal computer
systems of entrade.com are Y2K compliant.






QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK



There  have been no  material  changes in  reported  market  risks  faced by the
Registrant since December 31, 1998. The Company's  investment in COMFORCE common
stock is subject to liquidity and market price risks.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION


ARTRA  Group  Incorporated,   (hereinafter  "ARTRA"  or  the  "Company"),  is  a
Pennsylvania  corporation incorporated in 1933. Through November 20, 1998, ARTRA
operated  in one  industry  segment  as a  manufacturer  of  packaging  products
principally  serving the food  industry.  The  packaging  products  business was
conducted by the Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Bagcraft  Corporation  of
America ("Bagcraft"), which business was sold on November 20, 1998.


As discussed in Note 2, on February  23, 1999,  ARTRA  entered into an agreement
with Entrade Inc.  ("Entrade",  formerly NA Acquisition Corp.) and WorldWide Web
NetworX Corporation ("WWWX") providing for the merger of a subsidiary of Entrade
with ARTRA. Entrade, a 90% owned subsidiary of WWWX, owns all of the outstanding
capital stock of entrade.com, Inc. ("entrade.com") and 25% of the Class A Common
Stock of asseTrade.com, Inc. ("asseTrade.com").


entrade.com   is   an   Internet   business-to-business    electronic   commerce
("e-commerce")  company seeking to provide asset  disposition  solutions for the
utility and large industrial  manufacturing  sectors.  asseTrade.com proposes to
develop  and  implement  comprehensive   asset/inventory   recovery,   disposal,
remarketing  and management  solutions for corporate  clients  through  advanced
Internet electronic business applications, including on-line auctions.


Consummation  of the merger is subject to the  approval of the  shareholders  of
ARTRA. The Company expects to complete the transaction  during the third quarter
of 1999.


These condensed  consolidated  financial  statements are presented in accordance
with the  requirements  of Form 10-Q and  consequently  do not  include  all the
disclosures  required in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K.  Accordingly,
the Company's  annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1998, as filed with the  Securities and Exchange  Commission,  should be read in
conjunction  with  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.   The
condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet as of December 31, 1998 was derived from
the audited consolidated  financial statements in the Company's annual report on
Form 10-K.


In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect all normal recurring  adjustments necessary to present fairly
the financial  position as of March 31, 1999,  and the results of operations and
changes in cash flows for the three month periods ended March 31, 1999 and March
31, 1998.  Reported interim results of operations are based in part on estimates
that may be  subject to  year-end  adjustments.  In  addition,  these  quarterly
results of operations are not  necessarily  indicative of those expected for the
year.


2.       CHANGE OF BUSINESS



Entrade Inc.



On February 23, 1999,  ARTRA  entered into an Agreement  and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement") with WWWX, Entrade, a 90% owned subsidiary of WWWX, and WWWX
Merger  Subsidiary,  Inc.  ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Entrade,
pursuant to which  Merger Sub will merge into the Company (the  "Merger"),  with
the Company  being the  surviving  corporation.  As a result of the Merger,  the
Company will become a wholly owned  subsidiary of Entrade,  and the shareholders
of the Company  will  become  shareholders  of  Entrade.  Under the terms of the
Merger Agreement,  the Company's  shareholders will receive one share of Entrade
Common  Stock  in  exchange  for  each  share  of the  Company's  Common  Stock.
Additionally,  the ARTRA  preferred  stock  shareholders,  which  shall  include
persons who elect to exchange their BCA Holdings,  Inc.  ("BCA",  a wholly-owned
subsidiary  and parent of Bagcraft)  preferred  stock prior to the merger,  will
receive  shares  of  Entrade  Common  Stock  in  exchange  for  shares  of their
respective  preferred  stock  issuances (see Note 4 for a further  discussion of
preferred stock issuances). All stock options and warrants issued by the Company
and outstanding on the closing date of the Merger will be converted into Entrade
stock options and warrants. Entrade owns all of the outstanding capital stock of
entrade.com and 25% of the Class A Common Stock of asseTrade.com.

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,  on February 23, 1999,
Entrade  acquired  certain  software  and  intellectual  property and 25% of the
shares  of  Class A Voting  Common  Stock of  asseTrade.com  (collectively,  the
"Purchased  Assets")  from WWWX,  in exchange  for  1,800,000  shares of Entrade
Common  Stock,  $800,000  in cash  and a note  for  $500,000,  payable  upon the
consummation of the Merger or the earlier  termination of the Merger  Agreement.
On February 19, 1999, Entrade had agreed with Energy Trading Company ("ETCO"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Peco Energy Company,  to issue to ETCO 200,000 shares
of Entrade  Common  Stock,  and to pay ETCO  $100,000  in  exchange  for certain
retained rights ETCO held in the Purchased Assets. Entrade also agreed with both
WWWX and ETCO that it would  provide a minimum  of  $4,000,000  in  funding  for
entrade.com.  Under separate loan agreements, ARTRA agreed to loan Entrade up to
$2,000,000 to fund the $800,000 cash payment to WWWX and to provide  funding for
entrade.com  until the consummation of the Merger or the earlier  termination of
the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to guaranty
the $4,000,000 funding for entrade.com if the Merger is consummated.


Consummation  of the merger is subject to the  approval of the  shareholders  of
ARTRA. The Company expects to complete the transaction  during the third quarter
of 1999.



Bagcraft



Effective August 26, 1998, ARTRA and its wholly-owned BCA subsidiary, the parent
of Bagcraft, agreed to sell the business assets of Bagcraft.  Additionally,  the
buyer agreed to assume  certain  Bagcraft  liabilities.  The  disposition of the
Bagcraft business resulted in a net gain of $35,985,000.


The Company's 1998 consolidated  financial  statements have been reclassified to
report  separately the results of operations of Bagcraft.  The operating results
(in  thousands)  for  three  months  ended  March 31,  1998 of the  discontinued
Bagcraft subsidiary consist of:

3.            INVESTMENT IN COMFORCE CORPORATION


At March 31,  1999  ARTRA's  investment  in COMFORCE  Corporation  ("COMFORCE"),
1,525,500 shares,  currently a common stock ownership  interest of approximately
9%, was  classified in the  Company's  condensed  consolidated  balance sheet in
current assets as  "Available-for-sale  securities." At March 31, 1999 the gross
unrealized  gain  relating to ARTRA's  investment  in  COMFORCE,  reflected as a
separate component of shareholders'  equity,  was $8,536,000.  The investment in
COMFORCE common stock,  which represents a significant  portion of the Company's
assets at March 31, 1999 and  December 31,  1998,  is subject to  liquidity  and
market price risks.


In January 1996, the Company's  Board of Directors  approved the sale of 200,000
of  ARTRA's  COMFORCE  common  shares to  certain  officers,  directors  and key
employees of ARTRA for non-interest  bearing notes totaling $400,000.  The notes
are  collateralized  by the related  COMFORCE common shares.  Additionally,  the
noteholders  have the right to put their  COMFORCE  shares back to ARTRA in full
payment of the balance of their notes.  Based upon the  preceding  factors,  the
Company had concluded  that, for reporting  purposes,  it had  effectively  sold
options to certain  officers,  directors and key employees to acquire 200,000 of
ARTRA's  COMFORCE  common  shares.  Accordingly,  in January 1996 these  200,000
COMFORCE   common   shares  were  removed  from  the   Company's   portfolio  of
"Available-for-sale  securities" and were classified in the Company's  condensed
consolidated  balance  sheet as other  receivables  with an  aggregate  value of
$400,000,  based upon the value of proceeds to be received upon future  exercise
of the options. The disposition of these 200,000 COMFORCE common shares resulted
in a gain  that  was  deferred  and  will  not be  recognized  in the  Company's
financial statements until the options to purchase these 200,000 COMFORCE common
shares  are  exercised.  During the first  quarter  of 1998,  options to acquire
14,000 of these COMFORCE  common shares were  exercised  resulting in a realized
gain of $53,000.  At March 31, 1999,  options to acquire 55,750  COMFORCE common
shares  remained  unexercised  and were  classified in the  Company's  condensed
consolidated  balance sheet as other current  assets with an aggregate  value of
$112,000,  based upon the value of proceeds to be received upon future  exercise
of the options.


4.       REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK



ARTRA



In  March  1990,   ARTRA   issued  3,750  shares  of  $1,000  par  value  junior
non-convertible  payment-in-kind  redeemable  Series A  Preferred  Stock with an
estimated fair value of $1,012,000, net of unamortized discount of $2,738,000 as
partial   consideration  for  the  acquisition  of  the  discontinued   Bagcraft
subsidiary.


At March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998,  1,849.34  shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were  outstanding  with  carrying  values of  $2,921,000  and  $2,857,000,
respectively,  including accumulated  dividends,  net of unamortized discount of
$205,000  and  $239,000,  respectively.  The Series A  Preferred  Stock  accrues
dividends  at the rate of 6% per  annum and is  redeemable  by ARTRA on March 1,
2000  at a price  of  $1,000  per  share  plus  accrued  dividends.  Accumulated
dividends  of  $1,276,000  and  $1,246,000  were  accrued at March 31,  1999 and
December 31, 1998, respectively.



BCA Holdings/ Bagcraft



During 1992 and 1993, in exchange for cash consideration of $3,675,000, a former
related  party  received  3,675  shares  of BCA  Series A  preferred  stock  (6%
cumulative,  redeemable  preferred stock with a liquidation  preference equal to
$1,000 per share).  At March 31, 1999 and  December  31,  1998,  liabilities  of
discontinued  operations  included  1,672.18 BCA Series A  redeemable  preferred
shares with accumulated dividends of $514,000.

ARTRA GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued)



Effective  February 15, 1996,  BCA,  Bagcraft and a former related party entered
into an agreement to exchange certain preferred stock between the Companies. Per
terms  of the  exchange  agreement  BCA  issued  8,135  shares  of BCA  Series B
preferred stock (13.5% cumulative, redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation
preference  equal to $1,000 per share) to the former  related  party in exchange
for 41,350 shares of Bagcraft redeemable  preferred stock. At March 31, 1999 and
December 31, 1998, liabilities of discontinued  operations included 1,675.79 BCA
Series B redeemable preferred shares with accumulated dividends of $650,000.


At March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, liabilities of discontinued  operations
included 8,650 shares of Bagcraft 13.5% cumulative,  redeemable  preferred stock
(liquidation  preference  equal to $100 per  share).  Accumulated  dividends  of
$1,315,000 were accrued at March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.


On February  23,  1999,  ARTRA  entered  into a Merger  Agreement  with WWWX and
Entrade  (see Note 2). As a result of the  Merger,  the  Company  will  become a
wholly owned  subsidiary of Entrade,  and the  shareholders  of the Company will
become  shareholders  of Entrade.  Under the terms of the Merger  Agreement,  if
approved by the Company's shareholders,  the ARTRA preferred stock shareholders,
which shall include  persons who elect to exchange their BCA preferred stock for
ARTRA preferred stock prior to the merger, will receive shares of Entrade Common
Stock in exchange for shares of their respective preferred stock issuances.


5.       INCOME TAXES


No income tax benefit was  recognized in connection  with the Company's 1998 and
1997  pre-tax  losses  due to the  Company's  tax  loss  carryforwards  and  the
uncertainty of future taxable income.


At December 31, 1998,  the Company and its  subsidiaries  had Federal income tax
loss carryforwards of approximately  $10,000,000  expiring principally in 2010 -
2012,  available to be applied against future taxable income,  if any. In recent
years,  the Company has issued  shares of its common stock to repay various debt
obligations,  upon exercise of stock options and warrants,  as consideration for
acquisitions,  to fund working  capital  obligations  and as  consideration  for
various  other  transactions.  Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986
limits a corporation's  utilization of its Federal income tax loss carryforwards
when certain changes in the ownership of a corporation's common stock occurs. In
the  opinion  of  management,  the  Company  is not  currently  subject  to such
limitations   regarding  the   utilization   of  its  Federal  income  tax  loss
carryforwards.  Should the  Company  continue to issue a  significant  number of
shares of its common  stock,  it could  trigger a  limitation  on its ability to
utilize its Federal income tax loss carryforwards.


6.       EARNINGS PER SHARE


Effective  December 31, 1997,  the Company  adopted SFAS No. 128,  "Earnings per
Share".  Basic  earnings  (loss) per share is computed  by  dividing  the income
available to common shareholders, net earnings (loss), less redeemable preferred
stock dividends and redeemable  common stock accretion,  by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.


Diluted  earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the income  available
to common  shareholders,  net earnings (loss),  less redeemable  preferred stock
dividends and redeemable common stock accretion,  by the weighted average number
of shares of common  stock and  common  stock  equivalents  (stock  options  and
warrants), unless anti-dilutive, during each period.

7.       LITIGATION


The Company and its subsidiaries are the defendants in various  business-related
litigation and environmental  matters.  At March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998,
the  Company  had  accrued  current  liabilities  of  $1,500,000  for  potential
business-related   litigation  and   environmental   liabilities.   While  these
litigation and environmental matters involve wide ranges of potential liability,
management  does not believe the outcome of these  matters  will have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.


The discontinued  Bagcraft subsidiary's Chicago facility has been the subject of
allegations that it violated laws and regulations  associated with the Clean Air
Act.  The facility has  numerous  sources of air  emissions of volatile  organic
materials ("VOMs")  associated with its printing  operations and was required to
maintain and comply with permits and emissions  regulations  with regard to each
of these emission sources.


In  November  of 1995,  the EPA  issued a Notice of  Violation  ("NOV")  against
Bagcraft's  Chicago facility alleging  numerous  violations of the Clean Air Act
and  related  regulations.  In May  1998  Bagcraft  paid  $170,000  to  formally
extinguish this claim.


In  April  1994,  the  EPA  notified  the  Company  that  it  was a  potentially
responsible party for the disposal of hazardous  substances  (principally  waste
oil) at a disposal site in Palmer,  Massachusetts  generated by a  manufacturing
facility formerly operated by the Clearshield Plastics Division  ("Clearshield")
of Harvel Industries,  Inc. ("Harvel"), a majority owned subsidiary of ARTRA. In
1985,  Harvel was merged into ARTRA's  Fill-Mor  subsidiary.  This site has been
included on the EPA's National  Priorities  List. In February 1983,  Harvel sold
the assets of Clearshield to Envirodyne.  The alleged waste disposal occurred in
1977 and 1978, at which time Harvel was a majority-owned subsidiary of ARTRA. In
May 1994,  Envirodyne and its Clearshield  National,  Inc. subsidiary sued ARTRA
for indemnification in connection with this proceeding.  The cost of clean-up at
the Palmer, Massachusetts site has been estimated to be approximately $7 million
according  to proofs of claim  filed in the  adversary  proceeding.  A committee
formed by the named potentially  responsible parties has estimated the liability
respecting the activities of Clearshield to be $400,000.  ARTRA has not made any
independent  investigation  of the  amount  of its  potential  liability  and no
assurances can be given that it will not substantially exceed $400,000.

In a case titled Sherwin-Williams Company v. ARTRA GROUP Incorporated,  filed in
1991 in the United States District Court for Maryland,  Sherwin-Williams Company
("Sherwin-Williams")  brought  suit against  ARTRA and other former  owners of a
paint  manufacturing  facility in  Baltimore,  Maryland for recovery of costs of
investigation and clean-up of hazardous  substances which were stored,  disposed
of or otherwise released at this manufacturing facility. This facility was owned
by Baltimore  Paint and Chemical  Company,  formerly a subsidiary  of ARTRA from
1969 to 1980.  Sherwin-William's  current  projection of the cost of clean-up is
approximately  $5 to $6 million.  The Company  has filed  counterclaims  against
Sherwin-Williams  and cross claims  against other former owners of the property.
The Company also is  vigorously  defending  this action and has raised  numerous
defenses.  Currently,  the case is in its  early  stages  of  discovery  and the
Company cannot determine what, if any, its liability may be in this matter.


ARTRA was named as a defendant  in United  States v.  Chevron  Chemical  Company
brought  in the  United  States  District  Court  for the  Central  District  of
California  respecting  Operating  Industries,   Inc.  site  in  Monterey  Park,
California. This site is included on the EPA's National Priorities List. ARTRA's
involvement  stemmed from the alleged  disposal of hazardous  substances  by The
Synkoloid  Company  ("Synkoloid")  subsidiary  of  Baltimore  Paint and Chemical
Company,  which was formerly owned by ARTRA.  Synkoloid  manufactured  spackling
paste, wall coatings and related products,  certain of which generated hazardous
substances as a by-product of the  manufacturing  process.  ARTRA entered into a
consent  decree  with the EPA in which it agreed to pay $85,000 for one phase of
the  clean-up  costs for this site;  however,  ARTRA  defaulted  on its  payment
obligation.  ARTRA is presently unable to estimate the total potential liability
for clean-up  costs at this site,  which  clean-up is expected to continue for a
number of years.  The consent decree,  even if it had been honored by ARTRA, was
not intended to release  ARTRA from  liability for costs  associated  with other
phases of the clean-up at this site. The Company is presently  unable  determine
what, if any, additional liability it may incur in this matter.


In recent  years,  the  Company  has been a party to certain  product  liability
claims  relating  to the former  Synkoloid  subsidiary.  The  Company's  product
liability insurance has covered all such claims settled to date. As of March 31,
1999, the Company  anticipates that its product liability  insurance is adequate
to cover any additional pending claims.


Several cases have arisen from ARTRA's  purchase of Dutch Boy Paints which owned
a facility in Chicago which it purchased  from NL  Industries.  In a case titled
City of Chicago v. NL Industries,  Inc. and ARTRA GROUP  Incorporated,  filed in
the  Circuit  Court of Cook  County,  Illinois,  the City of  Chicago  brought a
nuisance action and alleged that ARTRA (and NL Industries,  Inc.) had improperly
stored,  discarded  and disposed of hazardous  substances at the Dutch Boy site,
and that ARTRA had conveyed the site to Goodwill  Industries  to avoid  clean-up
costs. At the time the suit was filed, the City of Chicago claimed that it would
cost $1,000,000 to remediate the site. The Company is currently negotiating with
the City of Chicago to settle this claim.


ARTRA and NL Industries,  Inc. have counter sued each other and have filed third
party actions  against the  subsequent  owners of the  property.  The Company is
presently  unable to determine its  liability,  if any, in connection  with this
case. The parties were conducting  discovery but the case was stayed pending the
resolution of the EPA action described below.


On November 17, 1995, the EPA issued letters to ARTRA,  NL Industries and others
alleging that they were potentially responsible parties with respect to releases
at the Dutch Boy facility in Chicago and demanding that they remediate the site.
NL  Industries  entered  into a  consent  decree  with EPA in which it agreed to
remediate the site. The Company is presently  unable to determine its liability,
if any, in connection with this case.


8.       OTHER INFORMATION


On February 23, 1999, the Company entered into three-year  employment agreements
with  three  individuals  to  manage  the  Company's  entry  into  the  Internet
business-to-business e-commerce and on-line auction business. In connection with
such employment,  the three individuals will receive  nonqualified stock options
for the  purchase  of  1,800,000  shares  of the  Company's  Common  Stock at an
exercise price of $2.75 per share. The options vest in three equal  installments
over a period ending February 18, 2001.  During the three months ended March 31,
1999, the Company recognized  compensation  expense of $300,000 related to these
stock options.

ARTRA has fallen below certain of the New York Stock Exchange's quantitative and
other  continued  listing  criteria.  Pursuant to the New York Stock  Exchange's
request,  ARTRA has  provided a  definitive  action plan  demonstrating  ARTRA's
ability  to  achieve  compliance  with the New  York  Stock  Exchange's  listing
standards,  including  the  succession  of Entrade  common stock to such listing
after the merger.  Based upon a review of that plan, the New York Stock Exchange
is  continuing  the  listing  of ARTRA  common  stock.  ARTRA will be subject to
ongoing quarterly  monitoring for compliance with the plan.  Failure to meet any
of the quarterly plan  projections  could result in the suspension  from trading
and subsequent  delisting of ARTRA common stock.  ARTRA's plan is dependent upon
consummation  of the merger  during the third  quarter of 1999. If the merger is
not  consummated,  ARTRA may not be able to satisfy the listing  requirements of
the New York Stock Exchange, and ARTRA common stock may be delisted from the New
York Stock Exchange.


9.       SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


On April 19, 1999,  ARTRA entered into a letter of intent to purchase all of the
issued and outstanding  common stock of Public  Liquidations  Systems,  Inc. and
Asset  Liquidation  Group,  Inc., d/b/a as Nationwide  Auction Systems Corp. The
purchase  price  shall  consist  of  cash of  $10,800,000  payable  at  closing,
1,570,000  shares of ARTRA  common  stock and a  $14,000,000  note,  subject  to
adjustment,  payable  over a two year  period  subsequent  to the closing of the
transaction.  Consummation of the transaction is subject to certain  conditions,
including  performance of the buyer's and seller's due diligence and negotiation
of a definitive  asset purchase  agreement.  The letter of intent,  as extended,
expires  on  June 1,  1999.  This  potential  acquisition  is not as yet  deemed
probable as no assurance can be given that the parties will  complete  their due
diligence or enter into a definitive agreement by that date.


During April 1999,  warrants were  exercised to purchase  approximately  560,000
shares  of  ARTRA  common  stock,  resulting  in  proceeds  to  the  Company  of
approximately  $2,400,000.  These warrants were issued principally as additional
compensation for various  short-terms loans, all of which were repaid before the
end of 1998.

Notes to Consolidated Balance Sheet



1.   Formation of the Company and Acquisitions


Entrade  Inc.,   formerly  NA  Acquisition  Corp.,   ("Entrade"  or  "the
Company"), a Pennsylvania  corporation,  was  incorporated in February of
1999 as a 90% owned  subsidiary  of  WorldWide  Web  NetworX  Corporation
("WWWX"). Entrade, through its wholly owned subsidiary, entrade.com, Inc.
("entrade.com")  intends to operate  as a  business-to-business  internet
electronic commerce ("e-commerce") service provider.


Upon  incorporation,  Entrade  acquired  from  WWWX all of the  assets of
BarterOne  LLC. In addition,  the Company also  acquired  from WWWX a 25%
interest in asseTrade.com,  Inc. ("asseTrade"), a company that intends to
provide  business  to business  internet  e-commerce  services.  WWWX had
acquired all of the membership  interests in BarterOne LLC in January and
February of 1999, under separate agreements with Global Trade Group, Ltd.
and Energy  Trading  Company,  a subsidiary  of PECO Energy  Corporation.
Following those  acquisitions,  BarterOne LLC was dissolved and WWWX took
direct title to its assets.


BarterOne LLC had been formed in December 1996 by Energy Trading  Company
and Global Trade Group,  Ltd., to develop  software and related  products
and services that would enable  users,  primarily in the electric and gas
utility industry, to effect barter transactions via an e-commerce system.
Energy  Trading  Company  provided  the  initial  capital  and  executive
support, while Global Trade Group, Ltd. provided software development.


In October 1998, Positive Asset Remarketing, Inc. (an affiliate of Global
Trade Group) forged an alliance with a joint venture entity,  Butcher Fox
LLC,  formed by Henry  Butcher  USA,  Inc.  ("Butcher")  and  Michael Fox
International,   Inc.   ("Fox"),   to  provide  BarterOne  LLC's  on-line
technologies and business methodologies to the Butcher and Fox industrial
clients. In December 1998, these parties formed asseTrade. Positive Asset
Remarketing,  Inc. transferred a 25% voting interest in asseTrade to WWWX
in January 1999.


Entrade  purchased  BarterOne  LLC  and  the 25%  interest  in  asseTrade
(collectively the "acquired  assets") from WWWX in exchange for 2,000,000
shares of Entrade common stock,  of which 200,000 were received by Energy
Trading Company pursuant to a tri-party  agreement  between WWWX,  Energy
Trading Company and Entrade, $800,000 in cash and a note for $500,000. As
WWWX and Entrade are under common control,  Entrade recorded the value of
the net assets and  interest  acquired  in these  transactions  at WWWX's
carrying  value.  The amount of purchase price paid to WWWX by Entrade in
excess of WWWX's carrying value for the assets of entrade and interest in
asseTrade has been recorded by Entrade as a reduction in common stock.

Proposed Merger



Entrade, WWWX, and WWWX Merger Subsidiary, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary
of Entrade ("Merger Sub"),  have entered into an agreement to merge ("the
merger  agreement")  the  Merger  Sub into ARTRA  Group  Incorporated,  a
publicly  traded  Pennsylvania  corporation  ("ARTRA").  The agreement is
subject to ARTRA shareholder approval. Entrade and WWWX have provided for
certain  changes  in  capital  structure  of Entrade if the merger is not
consummated.  The  merger  agreement  provides  that all  shares of ARTRA
common stock shall be converted  into shares of Entrade common stock on a
one for one basis  and that  ARTRA  will  guarantee  funding  of at least
$4,000,000 for the working  capital needs of Entrade.  In addition,  each
share of the  outstanding  redeemable  preferred  stock of ARTRA shall be
exchanged for 329 shares of Entrade common stock.  Concurrently  with the
merger  closing,  Entrade is  required  to make a cash  payment to Energy
Trading  Company  ("ETCO") in the amount of $100,000.  If for any reason,
the merger is not  consummated  on or before  September  30,  1999,  then
Entrade is required to issue to ETCO sufficient  additional shares of its
common  stock so that  ETCO will  hold a 33 1/3%  interest  in all of the
issued and outstanding  capital stock of Entrade. In such event, WWWX and
Entrade will amend the articles of  incorporation  and by-laws of Entrade
so  that  ETCO  will  have  all of the  same  protections  as a  minority
shareholder of Entrade as were accorded to Global Trade Group, Ltd. under
the terms of a prior operating  agreement for BarterOne LLC. Any dilution
of ownership of Entrade shall be on a pari passu basis.


Upon the  completion  of the proposed  merger ARTRA will  continue as the
surviving  corporation.  ARTRA  will  be a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
Entrade.


2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Cash and Cash Equivalents



Cash  and  equivalents  represent  cash  and  short-term,  highly  liquid
investments with original maturities three months or less.



Principles of Consolidation



The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiary,  entrade.com  Intercompany  transactions
and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.



Use of Estimates



The  financial  statements  are  prepared in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts that are
based on management's best estimates and judgments.  Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

Intangible Assets



Intangible assets represent principally  intellectual property which will
be amortized  over a period of five years on a straight  line basis.  The
Company reviews intangibles for impairment by comparing future cash flows
(undiscounted  and without  interest)  expected to result from the use of
the assets and their eventual disposition,  to the carrying amount of the
assets.


Equity interest


The Company has a 25% interest in asseTrade.com. This investment has been
recorded  based  upon the fair  value of the  consideration  paid for the
investment by WWWX. The Company  periodically  reviews the carrying value
of this  investment for  impairment.  Upon  commencement of operations of
asseTrade,  Entrade will  reflect 25% of  asseTrade  results on an equity
basis.


3.   Loan Agreement


In February  1999 the Company  entered into a loan  agreement  with ARTRA
under  which the Company  may borrow up to a maximum of  $2,000,000.  The
proceeds  of the  loan  are to be used for the  following  purposes:  (a)
$800,000 to fund the cash  purchase  price for the assets  acquired  from
WWWX  and  (b)  the  balance  to  fund  the  working   capital  needs  of
entrade.com.  The initial  loan of  $1,400,000  can be increased by three
additional  $200,000  increments subject to certain conditions related to
timing of closing under the merger  agreement.  Advances under the merger
agreement  are  collateralized  by a perfected  first  priority  lien and
security  interest  in all of the assets of the  Company.  The loan bears
interest at the  applicable  Federal rate,  which accrues  monthly and is
added to the principal balance. The entire outstanding  principal balance
of the loan is due and  payable  in one lump sum on the date  that is the
earlier of the closing date, as defined in the merger  agreement,  or the
date on which the merger agreement is otherwise terminated and the merger
abandoned.  At  February  23,  1999  the  balance  due  on the  loan  was
$1,400,000.

RISK FACTORS



This Prospectus Supplement contains certain forward-looking  statements
that involve risks and  uncertainties.  These statements relate to future plans,
objectives,  expectations and intentions.  These statements may be identified by
the  use of  words  such as  "expects,"  "believes,"  "anticipates,"  "intends,"
"plans" and similar  expressions.  Actual results could differ  materially  from
those  discussed  in these  statements.  Factors that could  contribute  to such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere
in this Prospectus Supplement.


As discussed in Note 2 the Company's condensed  consolidated  financial
statements  for the quarter  ended March 31, 1999,  on February 23, 1999,  ARTRA
entered into an agreement with Entrade Inc. ("Entrade",  formerly NA Acquisition
Corp.) and WorldWide Web NetworX  Corporation  ("WWWX") providing for the merger
of a subsidiary of Entrade with ARTRA.  Entrade, a 90% owned subsidiary of WWWX,
owns all of the outstanding capital stock of entrade.com,  Inc.  ("entrade.com")
and 25% of the Class A Common Stock of asseTrade.com, Inc. ("asseTrade.com").


Risk Factors Relating to Entrade and Its entrade.com Operations.


The  following  risk factors  relate to the business and  operations of
Entrade and its entrade.com operations:


We have no operating history upon which you may evaluate us.


We formed  Entrade  in  February  1999 at which  time it  acquired  the
intellectual  property  of  entrade.com  and 25% of the voting  common  stock of
asseTrade.com.  These entities had virtually no operating  history prior to that
time. Accordingly,  we have no operating history upon which you may evaluate us.
In addition,  our revenue  model is evolving.  Initially,  our revenues  will be
primarily  generated from  technology  license fees,  transaction  fees from our
asset disposi tion business  community  sites,  transaction fees associated with
on-line auctions and other listing,  maintenance and service fees. Our principal
initial  targeted  markets will be the utilities  industry and large  industrial
manufacturing  sectors.  In the  future,  we expect  to  generate  revenue  from
multiple sources,  including e-commerce  transaction fees and business services.
We may not be able to successfully  create  industry-specific  on-line  business
communities that will generate  significant  license and transaction fees. If we
do not generate such revenue,  our business,  financial  condition and operating
results will be materially adversely affected.


We  anticipate  we will  incur  continued  losses  for the  foreseeable
future.


Our lack of any operating history makes predicting our future operating
results, including operating expenses,  difficult. Our revenues may not grow. To
date, we have not generated revenues and have not been profitable.  We may never
be  profitable  or,  if we  become  profitable,  we may  be  unable  to  sustain
profitability. We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.


Some of our  expenses  are or will be fixed,  including  non-cancelable
agreements,  equip ment leases and real estate  leases.  If our  revenues do not
increase,  we may not be able to  compensate  by  reducing  expenses in a timely
manner. In addition, we plan to increase our operating expenses to:


o    launch industry-specific on-line business communities;


o    increase our sales and marketing operations;


o    broaden our customer support and operating software  capabilities;
and


o    pursue strategic marketing and distribution alliances.


Expenses may also increase due to the potential  impact of goodwill and
other charges resulting from any future acquisitions.


We may need to seek future funding sources.


We believe that the license fee revenues and other  funding by Artra of
Entrade's  operations  after the merger  will  enable  Entrade to  maintain  its
planned  operations  through  1999.  No  assurance  exists  that we will  attain
profitability.   If  revenues  from  entrade.com's   operations  are  less  than
anticipated  in 1999 and  2000,  funds  may have to be  raised  from  additional
financings.  We have no commitments for any financing other than from Artra, and
any financing  commit ments may result in dilution to our existing  shareholders
after the merger. The terms of any future financings may impose  restrictions on
our  right to  declare  dividends  or on the  manner  in which  we  conduct  our
business.


Fluctuations  in our quarterly  results may adversely  affect our stock
price.


25





It is probable  that our  quarterly  operating  results will  fluctuate
significantly due to many factors, including:


o    the uncertain adoption of the Internet as a commercial medium;


o    potential dependence on the general development of the  e-commerce
market;


o    reluctance   of  corporate   information   technology   groups  to
transition from existing internal  corporate  computer networks to
Internet-based e-commerce systems;


o    the pace of deregulation in the utility industry;


o    uncertainties relating to the pace  of  consolidation  within  the
electric utility industry;


o    the  effect of  deregulation  and  industry  consolidation  on the
decision-making   processes  of  management   within  the  utility
industry relating to capital expenditures and client acquisition;


o    market competition;


o    management of our growth; and


o    risks associated with potential acquisitions.


Many of these factors are beyond our control.  If our operating results
in  one  or  more  quarters  do  not  meet  the  securities  analysts'  or  your
expectations,  the price of Entrade  common stock could be materially  adversely
affected.


We intend to rely  heavily on  revenues  from the  utilities  and large
industrial  manufac turing sectors,  and if these revenues  decline our
business would be adversely affected.


We intend to rely on revenues generated from technology  licenses fees,
transaction  fees  from  our  asset   disposition   business   community  sites,
transaction fees associated with on-line auctions and other listing, maintenance
and service fees.  Our principal  initial  targeted  markets will be the utility
industry and large industrial manufacturing sectors. Our ability to increase our
revenues may depend, among other things on many factors, including:


o    the  development  of a large base of global  buyers and sellers of
assets through our industry-specific on-line business communities;


o    the  acceptance  by utilities and large  industrial  manufacturing
sectors of the Internet as a legitimate medium for asset transfers
and distribution;


o    uncertain  acceptance of our e-commerce related  methodologies and
service applications by internal corporate information  technology
groups;


o    the  transition  of  traditional  methodologies  based on internal
corporate computer networks to Internet-based e-commerce systems;


o    the acceptance of our fee structures within the utility  industry;
and


o    current and future competitors offering similar services.


We may not develop additional revenue sources.


If  we  do  not  generate   increased  revenue  from  on-line  business
communities,  our business,  financial  condition and operating results could be
materially  adversely  affected.  We plan to generate  revenues  through revenue
sharing  relationships  with  strategic  marketing  partners  with  whom we form
industry-specific  business  communities.  To generate significant revenues from
Internet  business-to-business  e-commerce,  we will have to  continue  to build
these relationships.


26





Marketing  and  distribution  alliances  may not  generate the expected
number of new customers or may be terminated.


We intend to use  marketing,  distribution  and  strategic  trade-group
alliances  with  other  Internet  companies  to create  traffic  on our  on-line
business communities and,  consequently,  to generate revenues.  These marketing
and  distribution   alliances  will  allow  us  to  link  our  on-line  business
communities  to  Internet  search  engines  and web sites.  The success of these
relationships  depends on the amount of  increased  traffic we receive  from the
alliance  partners' web sites.  These arrangements may not generate the expected
number of new customers. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to renew
these marketing and distribution alliance agreements. If any of these agreements
are terminated,  the traffic on on-line business communities could decrease.  We
plan to enter into  partnerships  with  strategic  industry-related  partners to
build industry-specific  business communities in addition to our primary initial
focus on the utility and large manufacturing  sectors,  but we cannot assure you
that we will be able to enter into any new partnerships.


We may not be able to  compete  effectively  with  other  providers  of
e-commerce services.


We believe that the strongest potential  competition does not come from
traditional  service  groups but rather the  evolution  of the  Internet and the
types of  business-to-business  service providers that evolution will create. As
applications  for  business-to-business  e-commerce  begin  to  proliferate  and
mature, entrade.com will compete with other technology companies and traditional
service  providers that seek to integrate  on-line  business  technologies  with
their tradi tional service mix.


Competition for Internet products and services and electronic  business
commerce is intense.  We expect that  competition  will  continue to  intensify.
Barriers to entry are  minimal,  and  competitors  can launch new Web sites at a
relatively low cost. We expect that  additional  compa nies will offer competing
on-line business communities on a stand-alone or portfolio basis.


Currently,  a number of software  developers  specialize in transaction
software.  These software  developers,  however,  do not  specifically  focus on
either asset recovery applications or our target industrial and utility markets.
Other  companies  offer asset  recovery  services  and/or asset  evaluation  and
auction systems.  Most of these groups,  however,  either  specialize in certain
industries  that we currently  do not target or focus on our target  markets but
have neither  Internet- based  e-commerce  transaction  technologies nor on-line
auction  capabilities.  Other  competitors  operate  e-commerce  transaction and
auction  technologies  through  the  Internet,  but do not,  for the most  part,
concentrate on asset  recovery  services  and/or large  industrial  groups.  The
current focus of these groups is  principally  the  business-to-consumer  retail
market.


A few groups  provide  asset  recovery for the utility  industry.  Most
notably,  the  National  Materials  Logistic  Group,  a  membership  of  nuclear
generation  facilities,  contracts  to  provide  parts  and  equipment,  listing
available assets for sale by and on behalf of member utilities through a


27





listing  service  called RAPID.  That group  specializes  in nuclear  generation
equipment rather than the broad spectrum of energy generation assets. Similarly,
a  few  auction  groups  offer  a  strong  off-line   presence  and  fulfillment
capabilities with large industrial companies.


E-commerce  applications  are  in  the  early  stages  of  development.
Currently, the principal focus of e-commerce  business-to-business  groups is to
provide  information  and generate  revenues from  advertisement.  As e-commerce
evolves,  however, we expect that other entrepreneurs and large industry leaders
in  specific  industry  sectors  will create  other  niche  business-to-business
services that may compete with our services.


Other  competitors may develop  Internet  products or services that are
superior to, or have greater market  acceptance  than, our solutions.  If we are
unable to compete successfully against our competitors,  our business, financial
condition and operating results will be adversely affected.


Some of our  competitors  have greater  financial,  marketing and other
resources than ours. Also, other established  e-commerce  companies with greater
financial,  marketing and other  resources that currently do not provide on-line
business-to  business may decide to add this type of service and compete with us
in the  future.  This  may  place  us at a  disadvantage  in  responding  to our
competitors' pricing strategies,  technological advances, strategic partnerships
and other initiatives.


We may  not be  able  to  protect  our  proprietary  rights  and we may
infringe the propri etary rights of others.


Proprietary  rights are  important  to our success and our  competitive
position.  Our ORBIT System has been federally registered as a trademark for use
on  specified  software.  We have  also  applied  for  federal  registration  of
"utiliparts.com"  and  "entrade.com" as service marks for use in connection with
our electronic commerce services.


Although we seek to protect our proprietary  rights, our actions may be
inadequate to protect any trademarks and other proprietary  rights or to prevent
others  from  claiming  violations  of their  trademarks  and other  proprietary
rights. Generally, our domain names for our on-line  industry-specific  business
communities  may not be  protectible  as  trademarks  because those names may be
deemed  descriptive  or  generic.  If we are unable to protect  our  proprietary
rights in  trademarks,  service  marks,  trade  dress and other  indications  of
origin,  competitors  will be able to use names and marks that are  identical to
ours or  sufficiently  similar to ours to cause  potential  customers  to become
confused  between us and our services and our  competitors  and their  services.
This confusion may result in the diversion of business to our competitors. Also,
to the  extent  these  competitors  have  problems  with  the  quality  of their
services, our reputation for quality may be injured.


Litigation  against  infringers of our service  marks,  trademarks  and
similar rights may be expensive. Because of the difficulty in proving damages in
trademark  litigation,  it may be very difficult to recover damages. We have not
conducted searches to determine if our service marks,


28





trademarks  and similar  items may infringe on the rights of third  parties.  If
third parties  success  fully assert claims of trademark,  service mark or other
infringement,  we may be  required  to change  our  service  marks,  trademarks,
company  names,  the design of our sites and materials  and our Internet  domain
names,  as well as to pay  damages  for any  infringement.  A change in  service
marks,  trademarks,  company names and Internet domain names may cause customers
to be unable to locate us or not  connect our new names and marks with our prior
names and marks, resulting in loss of business.


While our software,  text,  designs and other works of  authorship  are
protected   by  copy  right,   it  is  not   possible  to  detect  all  possible
infringements. Also, copyright protection does not extend to functional features
of software,  and so will not be effective to prevent third parties from reverse
engineering the  functionality of our software.  Our business  strategy includes
granting  access to the  source  code for our  software  to  certain  licensees;
whenever  access to source  code is  granted,  the  difficulty  associated  with
improperly using and modifying software is lessened.


We have not conducted  searches to determine if our software  infringes
on any  patents of third  parties.  If our  software is found to infringe on the
copyrights or patents of third parties,  we may be required to pay royalties for
past use and for  continued  use, or to modify or replace the  software to avoid
infringement.  There  can be no  assurance  that we would be able to  modify  or
replace the software. In addition,  effective copyright and trademark protection
may be unenforce able or limited in certain countries,  and the global nature of
the Internet  makes it  impossible  to control the ultimate  destination  of our
work.  We also  license  content from third  parties and it is possible  that we
could become  subject to  infringement  actions based upon the content  licensed
from those third parties.  We generally obtain  representations as to the origin
and ownership of such licensed content; however, this may not adequately protect
us. Any of these  claims,  with or  without  merit,  could  subject us to costly
litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.


Our  technology  rights  constitute  ownership of copyrights  and trade
secrets  embodied in certain  unique  portions of the  software now known as the
ORBIT System software and a license,  substantially  exclusive, to certain other
components of that  software.  We are now  developing a new version of the ORBIT
System  software.  We have  entered  into a contract  with a software  developer
pursuant  to which we are to obtain  all rights in the  software  created by the
developer.   While  we  attempt  to  determine  that  the  developer  is  taking
appropriate steps to remain in compli ance with this agreement,  there can be no
assurance that the developer will do so.


We may not be able to acquire or maintain effective web addresses.


We  currently  hold  various  Internet  web  addresses  relating to our
services  and   products.   These  web   addresses   include   entrade.com   and
utiliparts.com  as well as asseTrade.com  through our interest in asseTrade.com.
We may not be able to prevent  third parties from  acquiring web addresses  that
are  similar to our  addresses,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect our
business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  The  acquisition  and
maintenance of web addresses generally is regulated by governmental agencies and
their designees. For example, in the United


29





States, the National Science Foundation has appointed Network Solutions, Inc. as
the exclusive  registrar  for the ".com,"  ".net" and ".org"  generic  top-level
addresses.  The  regulation of web addresses in the United States and in foreign
countries  is subject to change.  As a result,  we may not be able to acquire or
maintain  relevant web addresses in all countries where we conduct business that
are consistent  with our brand names and marketing  strategy.  Furthermore,  the
relationship  between  regulations  governing such addresses and laws protecting
trademarks is unclear.


Our business depends on the effective development of the Internet as an
effective e- commerce business and marketing forum.


The  Internet   poses  risks  that  are   applicable  to  many  on-line
businesses, including ours. The following present a description of such risks:


Our  success  depends  on our  ability  to use  an  effective  Internet
marketing strategy which depends on Internet  governance and regulation
which is uncertain.


The future  success of our  business is dependent on our ability to use
an effective  Internet  marketing  strategy.  Because the  original  role of the
Internet was to link the  government's  comput ers with  academic  institutions'
computers,  the Internet was  historically  administered  by organiza tions that
were involved in sponsoring research.  Private parties have assumed larger roles
in the enhancement and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. Therefore, it
is unclear what  organization,  if any,  will govern the  administration  of the
Internet in the future, including the authorization of domain names. The lack of
an  appropriate  organization  to govern  the  administra  tion of the  Internet
infrastructure and the legal  uncertainties  that may follow,  pose risks to the
commercial  Internet  industry and could have a material  adverse  effect on our
business,  financial condition and operating results. In addition, the effective
operation of the Internet  and our business is also  dependent on the  continued
mutual  cooperation  among  several  organizations  that have  widely  divergent
interests.  These  organizations  may find that achieving a consensus may become
difficult,  impossible,  time-consuming  and costly. As a result,  the following
risks would have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition
and operating results:


o    uncertainty as to the legality of any action we may  take,  making
business planning and operations difficult;


o    the taking of harmful or  disruptive  actions  with respect to the
Internet by other organi zations and individuals;


o    a disruption of Internet administration,  effective operations and
maintenance,  including the inability of users to communicate with
other users or otherwise use the Internet; and


o    a  delay  in   infrastructure   improvements   necessary   to  the
maintenance and expansion of the Internet.


30





Although we are not subject to direct  regulation  in the United States
other than  federal and state  business  regulations  generally,  changes in the
regulatory  environment  could  result in our business  being  subject to direct
regulation  by the Federal  Communications  Commission  or other  United  States
regulatory agencies.  Additionally, as Internet use becomes more internationally
widespread,  there is an increased  likelihood of international  regulation.  We
cannot  predict  whether or to what extent any such new  regulation  will occur;
however,  such regulation  could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial  condition  and operating  results.  For example,  costs  incurred and
decisions  rendered as a result of the  enactment of new laws or adoption of new
regulations,  or investigations  and lawsuits based upon new laws or regulations
could have a material  adverse effect on our business,  financial  condition and
operating results.


Our business depends on the growth of the Internet, which is uncertain.


Our market is new and rapidly evolving. Our business would be adversely
affected if Internet  usage does not  continue  to grow.  Internet  usage may be
inhibited by a number of reasons, such as:


o    infrastructure;


o    security concerns;


o    inconsistent quality of service; and


o    lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed service.


If Internet usage grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support  the  demands  placed  on  it by  this  growth  or  its  performance  or
reliability may decline. In addition, web sites may from time to time experience
interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring
throughout  the  Internet  network  infrastructure.  If these  outages or delays
frequently occur in the future,  Internet usage, as well as usage of our on-line
business communi ties, could be adversely affected.


Adoption  of  the  Internet  as  a  medium  for   utilities  and  large
manufacturing industry asset trading and distribution is uncertain.


The growth of the  Internet as a service  and  solutions  provider  for
trading and  distribution  of assets in the  utilities  and large  manufacturing
sectors  requires  validation  of the Internet as an  effective  medium for this
purpose.  This  validation  has yet to fully occur.  Acceptance  of the Internet
among utilities and large  manufacturing  industry  managers will also depend on
growth in the  virtual  business  use of the  Internet.  If  widespread  virtual
business  use of the Internet  for those  sectors  does not  develop,  or if the
Internet  does not  develop  as an  effective  and  measurable  medium  for such
services,  our business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results could be
materially  adversely affected.  For example,  critical issues concerning use of
the Internet including


31





security,  reliability,  cost,  ease  of  use  and  quality  of  service  remain
unresolved  and may affect the  growth of and the  degree to which  business  is
conducted over the Internet.


No standards have been widely accepted to measure the  effectiveness of
Internet business solutions. If such standards do not develop,  managers may not
use the  Internet  and or may be  reluctant  to do so. Our  business,  financial
condition  and operating  results would be adversely  affected if the market for
Internet  asset trading and  distribution  for these sectors fails to develop or
develops slower than expected.


Our  long-term  success  depends  on the  development  of  the  on-line
business market which is uncertain.


If Internet business-to-business  electronic business commerce does not
grow or grows slower than  expected,  our business  will suffer.  Our  long-term
success depends on widespread market acceptance of electronic  business commerce
within the utilities and large manufacturing sectors.


A number of  factors  could  prevent  such  acceptance,  including  the
following:


o    Internet business-to-business  e-commerce is at an early stage and
managers  may  be  unwilling  to  shift  their   purchasing   from
traditional vendors to online vendors;


o    the necessary network  infrastructure for  substantial  growth  in
usage of Internet may not be adequately developed;


o    increased  government  regulation or taxation may adversely affect
the viability of electronic business commerce;


o    insufficient availability of telecommunication services or changes
in  telecommunication  services  could  result in slower  response
times; and


o    adverse  publicity  and  industry  concern  about the  security of
electronic  commerce  transactions could discourage its acceptance
and growth.


Additionally,  leading web site,  browser  providers and other Internet
distribution  channels may begin to charge us to provide  access to our products
and  services.  If any of  these  expenses  are  not  accompanied  by  increased
revenues,  our business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results would be
materially adversely affected.


Concerns   regarding   security  of   transactions   and   transmitting
confidential  information  over the Internet may negatively  impact our
e-commerce business.


We  believe  that  concern   regarding  the  security  of  confidential
information   transmitted  over  the  Internet,  such  as  business  and  supply
requirements, credit card numbers and other forms of


32





payment  methods,  prevents  many  potential  customers  from engaging in online
transactions.  If we do not add sufficient  security  features to future product
releases, our services may not gain market acceptance or there may be additional
legal  exposure to us. We intend to include basic  security  features in some of
our products and services to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data,
such as password  requirements  for access to  portions of our on-line  business
communities.   We  currently  use  authentication  technology,   which  requires
passwords and other information to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing a
customer's  information,  or encryption,  which  transforms  information  into a
"code"  designed to be  unreadable  by third  parties,  to protect  confidential
information.


Despite the measures we have taken, our  infrastructure  is potentially
vulnerable to physical or electronic  break-ins,  computer  viruses,  hackers or
similar  problems  caused by employees,  customers or other Internet users. If a
person  circumvents  our security  measures,  that person  could  misappropriate
proprietary  information  or cause  interruptions  in our  operations.  Security
breaches  that result in access to  confidential  information  could  damage our
reputation  and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.  We may be required to
make  significant  investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security
breaches.  Additionally,  as electronic  commerce  becomes more  prevalent,  our
customers will become more concerned  about  security.  If we do not ade quately
address these concerns,  this could  materially  adversely  affect our business,
financial condition and operating results.


Our computers  and  telecommunications  equipment  are  maintained by a
third party server  hosting  company.  Any system  interruptions  that cause our
on-line business  communities to be unavailable to web browsers may reduce their
attractiveness  to  customers  and  potential  customers  and  could  materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If the
server  hosting  company  does  not  reasonably  maintain  these  computers  and
telecommunications  equipment in effective working order and reasonably  protect
these systems  against the  following  interruptions,  our  business,  financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected:


o    fire;


o    natural disaster;


o    sabotage;


o    power loss;


o    telecommunication failure; and


o    human error or other disruptive events.


We may be subject to legal  liability for  publishing  or  distributing
content over the Internet.


33





We  may  be  subject  to  legal  claims  relating  to  the  content  in
industry-specific   on-line  business   communities,   or  the  downloading  and
distribution  of  such  content.  Claims  could  also  involve  matters  such as
defamation,  invasion of privacy,  disclosure of  confidential  information  and
copyright  infringement.  Providers of Internet  products and services have been
sued in the past, sometimes  successfully,  based on the content of material. In
addition,  some of the content provided in our on-line  business  communities is
drawn from data compiled by other parties, including governmental and commercial
sources,  and we re-key the data.  This data may have errors.  If our content is
improperly  used or if we  supply  incorrect  information,  it could  result  in
unexpected  liability.  Our  insurance may not cover claims of this type, or may
not provide sufficient coverage. Our business, financial condition and operating
results could suffer a material  adverse  effect if costs  resulting  from these
claims are not covered by our insurance or exceed our coverage.


Capacity constraints on our technology,  transaction  processing system
and network hardware and software may be difficult to project.


As  traffic  in  our  industry-specific  on-line  business  communities
increases,  we must expand and upgrade our  technology,  transaction  processing
systems and network  hardware  and  software.  We may not be able to  accurately
project the rate of increase in our on-line business  communities.  In addition,
we may not be able to expand and upgrade our  systems and network  hardware  and
software  capabilities  to  accommodate  increased  use of our on-line  business
communities.  If we do not appropriately  upgrade our systems,  network hardware
and software,  our business,  financial  condition and operating results will be
materially adversely affected.


Our market is characterized by rapid technological change.


Our market is characterized by rapid technological  change and frequent
new  product  announcements.  To be  successful,  we must adapt to the  changing
market by continually  improv ing the  responsiveness,  services and features of
our  on-line,  industry-specific  business  communi ties and by  developing  new
features to meet customer needs. Our existing technology, transaction processing
systems and network  software  are  currently  being  upgraded  for  proprietary
reasons and to address the evolving needs of our clients. While we believe these
upgrades  will  be  effective,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  significant
technological  changes will not render our technology obsolete. If we are unable
to  successfully   respond  to  these  developments  or  do  not  respond  in  a
cost-effective way, our business, financial condition and operating results will
be materially adversely affected.


Effectively managing our growth may be difficult.


We expect to grow  rapidly  both by adding new  products and hiring new
employees.  This growth is likely to place a significant strain on our resources
and  systems.  To manage our  growth,  we must  implement  systems and train and
manage our employees.  Many of our senior  management  have only recently joined
us. We cannot  assure you that our  management  will be able to  effectively  or
successfully manage our growth.


34





Acquisitions  may disrupt or  otherwise  have a negative  impact on our
business.


We plan to make  investments in complementary  companies,  technologies
and assets. Future acquisitions are subject to the following risks:


o    acquisitions  may cause a  disruption  in our  ongoing  business,
distract our management and other resources and make it difficult
to maintain our standards, controls and procedures;


o    we may  acquire  companies  in  markets  in which we have  little
experience;


o    we may  not be  able  to  successfully  integrate  the  services,
products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations;


o    we may be  required  to incur  debt or issue  equity  securities,
which  may be  dilutive  to  existing  shareholders,  to pay  for
acquisitions; and


o    our  acquisitions  may not result in any return on our investment
and we may lose our entire investment.


We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions.


Regardless   of  whether  we  can   identify   acceptable   acquisition
candidates,  we may not be able to  consummate  future  acquisitions  for  other
reasons  such as the  availability  of capital.  If we are unable to  consummate
future  acquisitions,  our business,  financial  condition and operating results
could be adversely affected.


Our success is dependent on our key personnel.


We believe that our success will depend on continued  employment of our
senior manage ment team and key technical  personnel.  If one or more members of
our senior management team were unable or unwilling to continue in their present
positions,  our business,  financial  condition  and operating  results could be
materially  adversely  affected.  Most of our senior  management have employment
agreements with Artra, which will be assumed by Entrade upon consummation of the
merger,  and there can be no assurance of continued  employment  of such persons
after the terms of these agreements expire.


Our success  also  depends on having a highly  trained  sales force and
telesales group.  Our telesales group is being formed.  We will need to continue
to hire additional  personnel as our business grows. A shortage in the number of
trained  salespeople  could limit our  ability to increase  sales in our on-line
business  communities  and to sell services as we launch these on-line  business
communities.


35





We plan to expand our employee base to manage our  anticipated  growth.
Competition for personnel,  particularly for employees with technical expertise,
is intense.  Our business,  financial  condition  and operating  results will be
materially adversely affected if we cannot hire and retain suitable personnel.


Our systems may not be Year 2000 compliant.


We believe that our ORBIT System  technology and our internal  computer
systems are Year 2000 compliant.  We may realize exposure and risk,  however, if
the systems on which we are  dependent  to conduct our  operations  are not Year
2000 compliant.  We are in the process of confirming Year 2000 compliance by our
third party service providers.  Our potential areas of exposure include products
purchased from third parties, computers,  software,  telephone systems and other
equipment used internally. Also, if clients,  distributors,  suppliers and other
third parties with which we conduct  business do not  successfully  address such
issues,  our  business,  operating  results  and  financial  position  could  be
materially and adversely affected.


In the event that our web-hosting  facilities provided by a third party
are not Year 2000  compliant,  our production web sites would be unavailable and
we would not be able to deliver  services  to our  users.  In the event that the
production and  operational  facilities  that support our web sites are not Year
2000 compliant, some portions of our web sites may become unavailable.


The  interests  of our  controlling  shareholders  after the merger may
conflict   with  our   interests   and  the   interests  of  our  other
shareholders.


As a result of its stock ownership, WWWX may be in a position to affect
significantly  our corporate  actions such as mergers or takeover  attempts in a
manner that could conflict with the interests of our public  shareholders.  WWWX
will own 1,800,000  shares or approximately  14.8% of the outstanding  shares of
Entrade  common  stock  after the  merger.  Principals  of WWWX also hold  stock
options to purchase an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of Artra common stock.


Our minority  interest in asseTrade.com  and the potential for deadlock
in stockholder  and board actions may impede the growth and development
of asseTrade.com's operations.


We  currently  hold 25% of the voting  common  stock of  asseTrade.com.
Positive Asset Remarketing,  Inc. holds a 25% voting interest, and the remaining
50% is held by Butcher Fox LLC. Our minority  interest  could reduce our ability
to direct the management and operations of  asseTrade.com.  Furthermore,  voting
interests by the  stockholders  and board members could become  deadlocked.  Any
deadlock would impede or prevent the growth and  development of  asseTrade.com's
operations, which would adversely affect our financial position and operations.


36





Shares  eligible  for  future  sales by our  current  shareholders  may
adversely affect our stock price.


If our shareholders  sell substantial  amounts of Entrade common stock,
including  shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding  options and warrants,
in the public market  following the merger,  then the market price of our common
stock  could  fall.  We also  may file one or more  registration  statements  to
register  all shares of Entrade  common  stock under our stock  option plans and
warrants  that we  will  be  assuming  from  Artra  in the  merger.  After  such
registration  state ments are  effective,  shares  issued upon exercise of stock
options and the warrants will be eligible for sale in the public market  without
restriction,  except that  affiliates of Entrade will be required to comply with
the registration  requirements under the Securities Act or an exemption from the
registration requirements, such as Rule 144.


Anti-takeover  provisions and our right to issue  preferred stock could
make a third party acquisition of us difficult.


Entrade is a  Pennsylvania  corporation.  Anti-takeover  provisions  of
Pennsylvania  law could  make it more  difficult  for a third  party to  acquire
control  of  us,  even  if  such  change  in  control  would  be  beneficial  to
shareholders.  Our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors
may  issue  preferred  stock  without  shareholder  approval.  The  issuance  of
preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.


The Entrade common stock price is likely to be highly volatile.


The  market  price of  Entrade  common  stock is  likely  to be  highly
volatile as the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related and
technology companies in particular,  has been highly volatile.  Our shareholders
may not be able to resell their shares of Entrade common stock following periods
of volatility  because of the market's adverse reaction to such volatility.  The
trading prices of many technology and  Internet-related  companies'  stocks have
reached  historical  highs within the last 52 weeks and have reflected  relative
valuations  substantially above historical levels.  During the same period, such
companies'  stocks have also been highly  volatile and have  recorded  lows well
below such  historical  highs. We cannot assure you that our stock will trade at
the same levels of other Internet stocks or that Internet stocks in general will
sustain their current market prices.


Factors  that could  cause such  volatility  may  include,  among other
things:


o    actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;


o    announcements of technological innovations;


o    new sales formats or new products or services;


o    changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;


37





o    conditions  or trends  in the  utilities  and large  manufacturing
industry sectors;


o    conditions or trends in the Internet industry;


o    changes in the market valuations of other Internet companies;


o    announcements   by   us  or   our   competitors   of   significant
acquisitions, strategic partner ships or joint ventures;


o    changes in capital commitments;


o    additions or departures of key personnel; and


o    sales of Entrade common stock.


Many of these  factors  are  beyond  our  control.  These  factors  may
materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock,  regardless of
our operating performance.






Risk Factors Relating to Artra



Lack of compliance  with New York Stock Exchange  listing  criteria may
result in delisting of Artra common stock or, after the merger, Entrade
common stock.


Artra  has  fallen  below  certain  of the New  York  Stock  Exchange's
quantitative  and other  continued  listing  criteria.  Pursuant to the New York
Stock  Exchange's   request,   Artra  has  provided  a  definitive  action  plan
demonstrating  Artra's  ability  to achieve  compliance  with the New York Stock
Exchange's listing  standards,  including the succession of Entrade common stock
to such listing after the merger. Based upon a review of that plan, the New York
Stock Exchange is continuing the listing of Artra common stock. Artra and, after
the  merger,  Entrade  will be  subject  to  ongoing  quarterly  monitoring  for
compliance with the plan.  Failure to meet any of the quarterly plan projections
could result in the suspension  from trading and  subsequent  delisting of Artra
common  stock and,  after the merger,  Entrade  common  stock.  Artra's  plan is
dependent upon  consummation  of the merger during the third quarter of 1999. If
the  merger is not  consummated,  Artra may not be able to satisfy  the  listing
requirements  of the New York  Stock  Exchange,  and Artra  common  stock may be
delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.


Artra's  potential   environmental   liabilities  and  other  potential
liabilities  from other claims may result in future costs to Artra that
are difficult to estimate.


Certain of the former  operations  of Artra and its  subsidiaries  have
been subject to require ments imposed  under  certain  federal,  state and local
environmental  and health and safety laws and  regulations,  including the Clean
Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource  Conservation  and Recovery  Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability act ("CERCLA")
and the Occupational  Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws,  relating
to


38





waste water  discharges,  air  emissions,  solid waste  management  and disposal
practices,  work place  safety and real  property use and  ownership.  Liability
under CERCLA is, in most  instances,  strict,  joint and  several,  meaning that
Artra  could be liable for all  response  costs  incurred.  As a result of these
environmental  matters, Artra and its subsidiaries have, from time to time, been
and  currently  are  involved in  administrative  and judicial  proceedings  and
inquiries.  The currently  pending  proceedings  relate  primarily to claims for
damages with  respect to sites and  facilities  of Baltimore  Paint and Chemical
Company,  Harvel Industries,  Inc., Dutch Boy Paints and Bagcraft Corporation of
America.  Artra has  provided  accruals  for  certain of these  claims.  Various
uncertainties,  however,  with  respect to these and other sites and  facilities
make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or
remediation  activities  or to estimate the future costs of such  activities  if
undertaken. See "Information About Artra -- Legal Proceedings" on page __.


In recent years,  Artra has been a party to certain  product  liability
claims relating to the former The Synkoloid Company subsidiary.  Artra's product
liability  insurance has covered all such claims settled or adjudicated to date.
Artra currently  anticipates that its product liability insurance is adequate to
cover any additional  pending claims.  If claims exceed the insurance  coverage,
however, Artra's financial position could be materially and adversely affected.


Artra preferred  stock may impact Artra's ability to obtain  additional
financing in the future.


Artra has significant indebtedness, liabilities and obligations arising
from certain  outstand ing issues of redeemable  Artra  preferred stock of Artra
and its subsidiaries. The Artra preferred stock, however, will be converted into
Entrade common stock upon consummation of the merger.  The degree to which Artra
is  encumbered   could  have  important   consequences  if  the  merger  is  not
consummated,  including  Artra's ability to obtain  additional  financing in the
future  for  working  capital,   capital   expenditures,   product  development,
acquisitions and general corporate purposes.






Merger-Related Risk Factors



Difficulties of integrating the new holding company structure after the
merger could  direct  management's  attention  from  operating  the new
business.


The anticipated  benefits of the proposed merger will depend in part on
the  integration  of the new operating  business of Entrade into the new holding
company  structure  in which  Entrade  will be the  holding  company  for Artra,
entrade.com and 25% of the outstanding voting common stock of asseTrade.com.  If
serious  difficulties are encountered during this integration,  manage ment will
have to divert  its  attention  to address  these  issues,  which  could have an
adverse effect on Entrade's  consolidated  operations  and financial  condition.
Also,  because  Entrade  currently  has a minority  interest  in  asseTrade.com,
Entrade will not have the power to direct the management of asseTrade.com  which
could  adversely  impact the ability of Entrade to integrate  the new  operating
business into the holding company structure.


Substantial  expenses  resulting  from the merger may affect  quarterly
results for the quarter in which the merger is consummated.


Artra and Entrade estimate that they will incur aggregate pre-tax costs
of approximately  $600,000 associated with the merger and related  transactions.
These costs and expenses  will affect  results of  operations  in the quarter in
which the merger is consummated.

Asbestos Exposure
Asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a rare, aggressive and incurable cancer. 
Asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present: At home, a public building such as a school or government office, a war fought on foreign soil or on the job.

In fact, occupational exposure is the No. 1 cause of asbestos disease. That means roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, firefighters, auto mechanics, insulators, factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure.
Those who worked in construction, shipyards, power plants, oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job.
U.S. military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products, especially on Navy ships.
For much of the 20th century, until its long-term toxicity became well known, thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance, versatility and tensile strength.

How Exposure Happens
Asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers. While no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe, most problems arise after repeated and long-term exposures to the carcinogen. 
Environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer, but it still happens regularly. Most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos, but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems.







"Asbestos-related disease is 100 percent preventable. That fact motivates me. It should motivate all of us. If we stopped using asbestos, by definition, we could stop asbestos disease." — Dr. Ken Takahashi, director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute


Harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings. Home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos. When asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut, sanded, drilled or disturbed in any way, microscopic fibers enter the air.
For example, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) took issue with the sandblasting practices of Alaska-based shipbuilding and repair facility Seward Ship's Drydock. The ADEC issued Seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled "fugitive particulate emissions" at its sandblasting operations.
If workers sandblasted asbestos-containing materials, such as paint, insulation or joint compounds, off of a vessel, the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area, and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them.
Fibers can remain airborne for hours, placing anyone nearby in danger. Once inhaled, they can become trapped in the respiratory tract, where they may stay for life.
Health Risks of Exposure
Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation, making breathing increasingly difficult.
They eventually will cause scarring, which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. In the early stages, symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until 20 to 50 years after the initial exposure.
Each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure. An estimated 10,000 Americans die annually from an asbestos-related disease. 
Currently, an estimated 200,000 people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestos-related illness.

Pleural plaques: These are the most common indication of asbestos exposure. They are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs.
Asbestosis: Asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally.
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not directly caused by asbestos, but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease.
Mesothelioma: This is a rare, aggressive and incurable asbestos-caused cancer.
Lung Cancer: Asbestos-related lung cancer accounts for approximately 4 percent of all lung cancer cases. Asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer. 

Where Exposure Occurs
Exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments, using asbestos-containing products or working in certain occupations, including the U.S. military. Exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters.


Military
Every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces incorporated asbestos. People on U.S. Navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early 1900s to the 1970s were most at risk. Since that time, thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service.

Battleships
Aircraft Carriers
Cruisers
Auxiliary Vessels
Submarines
Destroyers
Frigates

Products
Thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers. Asbestos may be found in insulation, drywall, ceiling and floor tiles, cements, paint and more. Most homes and commercial buildings built before 1980 contain asbestos products.

Occupations
Workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job. Drywall tapers, electricians, firefighters, auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk. While asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past, today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other job-related health risks.

Environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining, the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
In 2016, the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years, but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas. 
The study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising.
Researchers at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center conducted a similar study in 2015 that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in Nevada.
Northern California is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos. 
9/11 Attack on the World Trade Center
The terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, released more than 2,000 tons of asbestos into the air, causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months.
According to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, about 70 percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems. It found that 28 percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests. Researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble, along with nearby residents, for long-term health consequences related to asbestos and other toxic building materials.

A 2009 study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant. The study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and other asbestos-related conditions in Shubra El-Kheima, Egypt, an industrial city containing the Sigwart Company asbestos plant. It compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant, those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure. In total, the study had more than 4,000 participants.
The rate of MPM was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure, with 2.8 percent of this group having the cancer. The group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only 0.8 percent. As expected, the control group had the fewest incidences, with a rate of 0.1 percent.
These rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening. Overall, the study found a slightly higher, but still comparable, rate of asbestos-related illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents.
Improper Abatement
If asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure, there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed. It is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks.
Secondhand Exposure
People can get an asbestos-related disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral. Secondhand exposure, or indirect exposure, can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure.
While any kind of exposure is much less common today than even 20 years ago, women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the mid-20th century.
At that time, men comprised the majority of the industrial working class. The occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestos-containing products. Workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair, skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them.
Occurrences of Secondhand Exposure
Secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children. If children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age, they may develop an asbestos-related disease in their adult years. There are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure.



Laundry
The clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure. Because of the jagged structure of the fibers, the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing. Anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure.





Furniture
If a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home, fibers could have become embedded in the couch, chairs, carpet, bed and other pieces of furniture.





Hugs
If a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair, skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse, family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen. Some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work.
While family members didn't have any direct contact with asbestos-containing products, the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life.
Between 1941 and 1954, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City studied the health of 679 family members from the 1,664 workers employed at a factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers' family members. Sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former Patterson factory workers 20 years after the factory shut down.

Legal Claims for Secondhand Exposure 
Like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos, claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation. In order to bring a successful legal claim, they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers. This usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job.


John Panza Jr., diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012.

For example, John Panza Jr., a 40-year-old English professor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012. For more than 30 years, his father worked at a brake plant where National Friction Products Corp. products were drilled and abraded. As a child, Panza helped his father wash his work clothes. In 2012, Panza filed a lawsuit against National Friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the company's products that contaminated his father's clothes.
In 2013, an Ohio jury found National Friction liable for Panza's illness. It ordered the company to pay Panza and his wife $27.5 million. The award included $515,000 in economic damages, $12 million in noneconomic damages and $15 million for the wife's loss of consortium claim. 
Protecting Yourself and Loved Ones
Despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life, people can protect themselves by being vigilant. 
Workers should use protective equipment provided by employers. It is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices. Approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers.
It also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family. Any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site. Showers should be taken before returning home.
Safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems.
If you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t adequately protecting you from asbestos, file an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Asbestos Products Manufacturers
Even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world, the industry continues to thrive. Concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than 50 nations — including the entire European Union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use. Strict U.S. regulations took hold in the 1970s. Yet countries like Russia, China, Brazil and Kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale.

At the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life. Since the late 1800s, American companies like the Johns Manville Corporation amassed great wealth by mining, manufacturing and selling asbestos-containing products. Centuries later, medical evidence revealed Johns Manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers.
In decades past, asbestos use was far more pervasive in the United States. Contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding, construction, power generation and heavy manufacturing. Since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the 1970s, asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy. In many cases, companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits.

While medical evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause life-threatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, the consumption of contaminated products in the United States and many other countries continues. According to a 2011 inventory of more than 60,000 asbestos-laden products, approximately 600 companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year.

Fast Fact: In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal acquired Mundet Cork, inheriting more than $700 million current and future asbestos liabilities.

History of Manufacturing

Although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years, it was only during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s that the industry flourished. A natural resistance to heat, chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications. Soon enough, manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines, piping and locomotives. Thousands of other uses later emerged, and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers, gaskets, cement, roofing materials and automotive brake pads.


By the early 20th century, some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers. But rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards, some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation. Internal documents indicate that Johns Manville executives were aware of the risks as early as 1934. The company conducted private medical studies around this time, and the negative results remained confidential for decades.


Asbestos use increased throughout World War II, largely because of military shipbuilding contracts. The U.S. government required asbestos insulation be used in U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. For several decades after the war, hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products.

In addition to Johns Manville, other leading asbestos manufacturers include:

Owens Corning/Fibreboard Corp.
Raybestos-Manhattan Co.
National Gypsum Corporation
W.R. Grace & Co.
Celotex Corp.


By the 1960s, scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestos's harmful effects. One landmark occupational study conducted by Dr. Irving Selikoff in 1964 showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers. Results indicated that between 1943 and 1962, an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Selikoff's findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use. The result was a significant downturn for America's asbestos industry.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dealt another blow to the industry with the Clean Air Act of 1970. It established the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants. Several new regulations directly affected the industry, specifically companies that milled, sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials. By the late 1970s, many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products.


Although the U.S. Geological Survey asserts that U.S. asbestos use has fallen 99.9 percent since 1973, it is not yet banned in the United States. Limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials, building materials like cement and in various textiles.

Fast Fact: A C & S stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in 1974, but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade.

Products

During the peak era of asbestos consumption, it was incorporated into approximately 3,000 types of products. One of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products, a use that spanned industries including construction, shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing.


Countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos, including ceiling tiles, joint compounds, cement, drywall and roofing materials. These products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions, as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air.


The toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope, cloth and garments. Shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient.


Another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry. Many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction, such as gaskets and brake pads, contained some percentage of asbestos.

Industries & Occupations

According to the World Health Organization, about 125 million people experience workplace exposure worldwide. By far, the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral. These activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air.


Another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction. While drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks, many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project.


Shipyard workers, especially during the World War II era, experienced heavy exposure as well. Tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels, and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous. Also at risk were pipefitters, boiler workers and electricians who serviced U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships.


Litigation & Specific Lawsuits


A staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades, jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos. According to one litigation report from 2002, an estimated 730,000 people filed related claims against at least 8,400 corporations.


Some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimillion-dollar verdicts or out-of-court settlements. When courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death, they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and loss of consortium. Many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings.


In one standout 2005 case, U.S. Steel was ordered to pay $250 million to Roby Whittington, the wife of a former U.S. Steel employee who died of mesothelioma. Several other manufacturers defended the case, but U.S. Steel was found 100 percent liable for Whittington’s death. Georgia-Pacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the jury awarded Mrs. Whittington $50 million in damages and $200 million in punitive damages.


A San Francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to Alfred Todak, holding more than 25 firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis. A former electrician, Todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard Navy vessels from 1960 to 1976. Eighteen firms settled with Todak out of court for a total of $4.2 million, and Foster Wheeler Ltd. contributed 30 percent of the jury’s $22.7 million verdict. Todak’s wife also received $11 million for related losses.


More recently, a 2011 lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of $22 million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets. The gasket manufacturers, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Goodyear Canada, were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of Walter Koczur and Eugene McCarthy, despite both being longtime smokers.

Fast Fact: Pittsburgh Corning announced in 2009 that it would pay out $825 million in cash over the next 15 years to cover asbestos-related claims.


Trust Funds


With multibillion-dollar liabilities looming, many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain, yet steadily rising, costs of legal compensation. The U.S. government estimates that more than 100 companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation, including industry giants like National Gypsum, Dana Corporation and EaglePicher Industries.


As part of their reorganization plans, companies often create personal injury trusts. Forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court, designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation. Bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities.


Since Johns Manville created the first trust in 1987, nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust. By 2011, these trusts had awarded a total of $17.5 billion. Some of the largest trusts include:
