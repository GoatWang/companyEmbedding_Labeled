The company culture and team is unlike anything you'll experience anywhere else. It is truly a team effort and you'll enjoy going to work every day. Having a great work culture is half the battle and Ebiquity is where you want to be.2. Ebiquity is constantly evolving thanks to the leadership. This wasn't always the case but in the last two to three years the strives and changes the company has made have only been for the better. They are open to new ideas and creative thinking. This is encouraged on levels.3. They are always open to hearing new ideas and innovative thinking for their clients.4. The clientele you will work with is a highly impressive fortune 500 list. I guarantee you won't find a client list like this anywhere else.5. You will always be "in the know" about the advertising and marketing industry. Your job requires you to be up-to-date always and I can't tell you how much you'll appreciate this.6. There are basic guidelines you have to follow for each client, but you have the room to shape and craft your reports that you send to your clients. You are allowed to manage your accounts without someone hovering over you.7. Every week is different - can't express how much this is appreciated8. The global blog is so insightful and has something for everyone in the industry. If you can, contribute to it. It's a widely respected blog9. Working in a global firm obviously comes with challenges but there are challenges everywhere, being able to work with teams across the world for clients across the world is an opportunity that doesn't come along often. The insight you are able to learn from a global perspective is worth any stress that you might endure.10. Ebiquity encourages its employees to learn and be better. The company goes out of their way to help you reach new career strives and better your work.ConsIn such a big company sometimes messages and news gets lost in translation but management was doing a much better job at streamlining.Advice to ManagementContinue to keep the great culture you have. Any sight of someone derailing that, needs to be addressed in the upfront not when it's too late.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Ebiquity Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ebiquity 2015-12-03 06:29 PST Aug 10, 2015 Helpful (1)"I want to provide more but...."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookI worked at Ebiquity full-time (More than 3 years)ProsThe people are hardworking and brightConsToo many management changes.

Lots of assistance and you never have to feel embarrassed about asking questions or admitting you don't know how to do something. Good work/life balance; unless you're slaving on a major project you aren't expected to work long hours. Free coffee, occasional happy hours/team outings.Good sense of autonomy; it's up to you to get your work done on your own time, management isn't standing over your shoulder constantly. Lots of opportunity to be proactive and prove yourself and take on extra work. Though don't expect to be compensated or even thanked.ConsPay is an absolute joke, laughable, and well below industry standards. Management tries to squeeze as much work out of you for as little compensation as possible and hopes you won't notice. Virtually zero opportunity for advancement. No bonuses or commissions for Chicago sales team. Zero training/onboarding for new employees or career development for existing employees.Lots of ambiguity around deadlines and lots of failed initiatives. You are expected to make certain projects your number one priority then they are never mentioned again or pushed to the back burner, with little or no explanation, essentially rendering all your hard work useless.Lots of data entry and repetitiveness.People in London are overprotective/territorial of the work they do and don't know how to share, except when they need you to do your their work for them."HR" is nonexistent in Chicago. Don't count on any discretion or privacy when talking to "HR" as your personal info will be blabbed around the office in a matter of minutes.Advice to ManagementMaybe take some money out of the bloated travel budget for senior management and give it to your employees? Do you really need to be sending mid-level people to London on a monthly basis?Invest in the product. When you think you've invested enough, invest more and more until the product is perfect and actually works the way it should. Then, invest in your employees. Make sure they are happy and productive, not just cogs in a machine. A once-yearly "survey" does not count. Follow through on initiatives, don't just let them peter out and hope people will forget. They don't. They wonder why they spent so much time working on a project that makes senior management look good only to have it fall by the wayside.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Ebiquity Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ebiquity 2014-01-27 13:09 PST Sep 24, 2013 Helpful (2)"No room for growth, management can be highly clique-oriented, lacking professionalism..."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Ebiquity full-time (More than 5 years)ProsVery comfortableCasual work environmentExperience working with top-notch clientsConsThere are no opportunities for growth - there are not clearly defined career paths nor are there opportunities to learn additional skills, like working with software like ExcelAdvice to ManagementValue employees: Keep their long term career paths in mind, train them on a skill set that can be used both inside and outside of the Ebiquity world.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Ebiquity Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ebiquity 2013-09-24 11:28 PDT Showing 36 of 37 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious1234NextReviews > Ebiquity RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleAdvertising Monitor (4) Media Consultant (2) CloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreEbiquity PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedStratigent ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 11 ReviewsChelsea Apps Factory ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 11 ReviewsMedia Audits International ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 18 Reviews no.logo.altClarion Research ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 3 ReviewsSIS International Research ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 14 ReviewsProbe Information Services ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 23 ReviewsIBM ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 31,290 ReviewsIpsos ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 981 ReviewsiCrossing ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 146 ReviewsMindshare ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 506 ReviewsBNP Paribas ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 2,064 ReviewsAlliedBarton ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,697 Reviews Related Job SearchMedia Analyst jobsMedia Analyst salaries ($49k)Data Analyst jobsData Analyst salaries ($60k)Media Consultant jobsMedia Consultant salaries ($37k)Account Executive jobsAccount Executive salaries ($47k)Account Manager jobsAccount Manager salaries ($52k)Customer Service Representative jobsCustomer Service Representative salaries ($25k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Assistant Account Executive jobsAssistant Account Executive salaries ($39k)Sales Representative jobsSales Representative salaries ($39k)Project Manager jobsProject Manager salaries ($90k)Associate jobsAssociate salaries ($92k)Software Engineer jobsSoftware Engineer salaries ($84k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

Our Vision
Our long term strategic ambition is for Ebiquity to be known as the leading, independent, technology-enabled marketing and media analytics consultancy globally.
Strategy
Our corporate purpose of “creating clarity” shapes everything we do. This includes the clear and straightforward strategy we have adopted to deliver our Growth Acceleration Plan. We call this the 5Ps, and it covers: People, Product, Process, Profile, and Performance.
We believe that by having the right people and products in place, developed and delivered using the right processes, we will deliver the strong performance that our current and future stakeholders demand. 
By raising the profile of our cutting‑edge approaches to creating clarity of marketing performance for our advertiser clients, we will further enhance our performance.
Indeed, performance – in terms of revenue, profit and underlying operating profit – will be a consequence of our focus on the first 4Ps.
Our 5P's strategy provides the framework for our five-year objectives: 

People
Attract, retain and develop high calibre talent from the media, data science and consultancy sectors.




Product
Launch proprietary products and services that harness our data and insights and enable us to be trusted advisers for our clients.




Process
Shape the organization and its processes to support broader and deeper client relationships.




Profile

Trading Statement

RNS Number : 3058F Ebiquity PLC 27 July 2016  

Ebiquity Plc                                           
("the Company")
 
 
Trading Update
 
Ebiquity plc, the leading independent marketing analytics specialists, today announces a trading statement for the half year ended 30 June 2016.
 
Ebiquity continues to grow revenue and profit ahead of the equivalent period last year with overall performance broadly in line with market expectations. 
 
The Media Value Measurement practice (MVM) continued to grow in the first half of the year, although we experienced a slow-down in the rate of growth as some contract renewals and new business awards were delayed - particularly in the US - as advertisers awaited the publication of the US Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) Media Transparency reports.  We anticipate faster year on year revenue growth over the remainder of the year as advertisers action the ANA's recommendations, prepared in partnership with Ebiquity and FirmDecisions, which were released on 18 July.
 
The Marketing Performance Optimization practice (MPO) has generated significant growth across all markets and achieved record growth overall. We expect strong performance from this practice over the remainder of the year. 
 
The Market Intelligence practice (MI), as previously reported, operates in a highly competitive environment with revenues for this business anticipated to decline.  Revenue from our platform business (Portfolio) was broadly flat year on year outside the US where revenue reflected pressure on client budgets. Our project based business further contracted as expected although at a faster rate than planned. We are continuing to progress our product development and previews of our upcoming product launches have been well received by clients.  These product enhancements should be available for the 2017 renewal season.
 
With approximately two-thirds of Group revenue denominated in non-Sterling currencies, we have received some revenue benefit from Sterling's weakness in the first half of the year. Should this continue, there will be further revenue benefit in the second half of the year, accompanied by a proportionate increase in costs and an overall neutral impact on operating margins.
 
The Company is confident of achieving Board expectations for the full year to 31 December 2016 with improved growth in MVM and a strong performance in MPO offsetting the weaker than initially anticipated performance from MI.  
 
On 28 September 2016 the Company will release its interim report for the six month period ended 30 June 2016.
