Acquisitions  Emantras  McKinney Rogers  Maverick Solutions  Jencal Training  Operating Highlights  Three Months ended June 30, 2017 Compared to the Three Months ended June 30, 2016  Our revenue increased $5.6 million or 4.5% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The net increase is due to a $4.3 million increase in our Performance Readiness Solutions segment, a $1.0 million increase in our Sandy Training & Marketing segment and a $0.7 million increase in our Learning Solutions segment, partially offset by a $0.4 million  decline in our Professional & Technical Services segment. Foreign currency exchange rate declines resulted in a total $3.2 million decrease in U.S. dollar reported revenue during the second quarter of 2017. The changes in revenue and gross profit are discussed in further detail below by segment.  Operating income, the components of which are discussed below, increased $0.9 million or 11.6% to $9.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $8.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. The net increase in operating income is primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in gross profit, offset by a $1.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $0.2 million decrease in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the second quarter of 2017.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, we had income before income tax expense of $8.5 million compared to $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Net income was $5.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.

The revenue increase is due to the following:   A $0.5 million revenue increase attributable to the Emantras acquisition completed on April 1, 2017; partially offset by   A $2.4 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Professional & Technical Services revenue decreased $0.4 million or 1.4% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The revenue decrease is due to the following:   A $0.6 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and   A $0.4 million net decrease in training services for energy clients; partially offset by   A $1.3 million increase in alternative fuels design and build projects.  Sandy Training & Marketing revenue increased $1.0 million or 3.6% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The net increase is primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in training services for automotive clients and a $0.4 million increase in magazine publications.  Performance Readiness Solutions revenue increased $4.3 million or 22.1% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The revenue increase is due to the following:   A $1.7 million increase attributable to the McKinney Rogers acquisition completed on February 1, 2017;   A $0.5 million increase in technical training services largely due to a new contract with an aerospace client;   A $0.6 million increase in platform adoption training services; partially offset by   A $0.2 million decrease in performance consulting services; and   A $0.2 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the revenue increase. In addition, the increase in gross profit was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in gross profit due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Professional & Technical Services gross profit of $4.1 million or 16.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was consistent with second quarter 2016 gross profit of $4.1 million or 15.8% of revenue.  Sandy Training & Marketing gross profit of $4.1 million or 14.4% of revenue for the second quarter of 2017 increased by $0.2 million or 6.4% when compared to gross profit of $3.8 million or 14.0% of revenue for the second quarter of 2016 due to the organic revenue increases noted above.  Performance Readiness Solutions gross profit of $4.1 million or 17.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2017 increased by $1.3 million or 45.1% when compared to gross profit of $2.8 million or 14.6% of revenue for the second quarter of 2016. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to a $0.6 million increase attributable to acquisitions and the remaining $0.7 million increase is primarily due to the organic revenue growth noted above and a decrease in costs due to cost cutting measures.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million or 7.8% from $12.3 million for the second quarter of 2016 to $13.2 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in costs relating to our new financial system implementation which we anticipate will go live in 2018.  Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration  We recognized a $0.1 million net loss on the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions during the second quarter of 2017 compared to a net gain of $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations result from changes in discount periods and rates and changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings projections.  Interest Expense  Interest expense increased to $0.5 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $0.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase in interest expense is due to both an increase in interest rates and higher borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  Other (Expense) Income  Other expense was $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to other income of $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2016, and consists primarily of income from a joint venture offset by foreign currency gains and losses in both periods. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we had a $0.2 million net foreign currency loss compared to a $0.1 million net foreign currency gain during the same period in 2016, and a $0.1 million decrease in income from a joint venture compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily relate to the effect of exchange rates on intercompany receivables and payables and third party receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense was $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2016. The effective income tax rate was 30.7% and 38.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to a change in the mix of taxable income from higher taxing jurisdictions to lower taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense for the quarterly periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate which includes the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. statutory rates, permanent differences, and other items that may have an impact on income tax expense.  Six Months ended June 30, 2017 Compared to the Six Months ended June 30, 2016  Our revenue increased $12.3 million or 5.1% and our gross profit increased $3.6 million or 9.3% during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to six months ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in revenue is due to a $8.9 million increase in our Performance Readiness Solutions segment, a $3.8 million increase in our Sandy Training & Marketing segment and a $0.5 million increase in our Learning Solutions segment, partially offset by a $0.9 million decline in our Professional & Technical Services segment. Foreign currency exchange rate declines resulted in a total $6.9 million decrease in U.S. dollar reported revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2017 across all segments. The changes in revenue and gross profit are discussed in further detail below by segment.  Operating income, the components of which are discussed in detail below, increased $1.7 million or 12.5% to $15.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $14.0 million for the same period in 2016. The net increase in operating income is primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in SG&A expenses.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we had income before income tax expense of $14.5 million compared to $14.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Net income was $9.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $8.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 16.8 million for both the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

The revenue increase is due to the following:   A $0.8 million revenue increase attributable to the Jencal Training acquisition completed on March 1, 2016; and   A $0.5 million revenue increase attributable to the Emantras acquisition completed on April 1, 2017; partially offset by   A $5.1 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Professional & Technical Services revenue decreased $0.9 million or 1.7% during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The net decrease in revenue is due to the following:   A $0.4 million net decrease in training services for energy clients;   A $0.4 million net decrease in training and technical services for oil and gas clients; and   A $1.3 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; partially offset by   A $1.9 million increase in alternative fuels design and build projects.  Sandy Training & Marketing revenue increased $3.8 million or 7.7% during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The net increase is primarily due to the following:   A $0.7 million increase in training services for in-dealership and other training programs for automotive customers;   A $0.2 million increase in magazine publications revenue due to an increase in the volume of publications delivered; and   A $0.2 million increase in glovebox portfolio revenue.  Performance Readiness Solutions revenue increased $8.9 million or 23.6% during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The net decrease is primarily due to the following:   A $3.5 million increase attributable to the Maverick acquisition completed on October 1, 2016;   A $3.4 million increase attributable to the McKinney Rogers acquisition completed on February 1, 2017;   A $1.6 million increase in technical training services largely due to a new contract with an aerospace client; and   A $1.1 million increase in platform adoption training services; partially offset by   A $0.2 million decrease in performance consulting services; and   A $0.5 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to a one-time cost reduction related to a UK government funded skills training contract during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, there was a $1.2 million decrease in gross profit due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These gross profit decreases were offset by an increase in gross profit due to the revenue increases in this segment during the first half of 2017.  Professional & Technical Services gross profit of $8.7 million or 17.1% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased by $0.7 million or 9.3% when compared to gross profit of $8.0 million or 15.4% of revenue for the same period in 2016. Despite the net decline in revenue, gross profit increased primarily due to a decrease in indirect labor expense during the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  Sandy Training and Marketing gross profit of $7.0 million or 13.1% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased by $0.7 million or 10.7% when compared to gross profit of $6.3 million or 12.8% of revenue for the same period in 2016 due to the organic revenue increases noted above.

The increase in gross profit is primarily due to a $1.2 million increase attributable to acquisitions and the remaining $1.3 million increase is primarily due to the organic revenue growth noted above and a decrease in costs due to cost cutting measures.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.0 million or 8.2% from $24.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $26.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in costs relating to our new financial system implementation which we anticipate will go live in 2018, a $0.2 million increase in bad debt expense, and a $0.2 million increase in legal costs primarily related to acquisitions.  Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration  We recognized a net gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of $0.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

 Updated: November 29, 2016Applies To: Dynamics 365 (online), Dynamics 365 (on-premises), Dynamics CRM 2016, Dynamics CRM OnlineMicrosoft Dynamics 365 uses the ProductPriceLevel.PricingMethodCode attribute to determine prices. The value of this attribute affects: How the price for the product is determined for each unit of measure that is defined for that product.What attributes are required when you create or update a product price level and its associated product.You can also use custom pricing for products instead of using the Dynamics 365 system pricing. More information:  Use custom pricing for productsThe following table lists the formulas that are used for each value and the attributes that are required by each value.Drop-down list value and equivalent pricing method valueDescription and required attributesCurrency Amount CurrencyAmount = 1The price is specified for each unit of measure for each product. price = amountFor each unit of measure for each product, use the ProductPriceLevel.Amount attribute.Note The ProductPriceLevel.Amount attribute isn’t platform required if you’re not using the pricing methods provided by Microsoft Dynamics 365. However, if you use the Currency Amount pricing method to determine a price, this attribute is platform required and you must specify a value for this attribute. Percent of ListPercentListPrice = 2The price is calculated based on the manufacturer's or distributor's list price. calculated price = list price x percentageFor each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes:Product.Price attribute. This is the List Price in the Product form.ProductPriceLevel.Percentage attribute. This is the desired percentage of the list price.ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode attribute. This is the policy for rounding the price list.Percent Markup - Current CostMarkupCurrentCost = 3The price is calculated as a percentage of your current cost for the item. calculated price = current cost x 100% + percentageFor each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes:Product.CurrentCost attribute. You must update this cost every time that you receive a shipment of the item. ProductPriceLevel.Percentage attribute. This is the percent markup.ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode attribute. Percent Margin - Current CostMarginCurrentCost =4The price is based on the profit percentage you want to achieve and your current cost for the item. calculated price = current cost + [(current cost x percentage)/ (100% - percentage)]For each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes:Product.StandardCost attribute. You must update this cost every time when you receive a shipment of the item. ProductPriceLevel.Percentage attribute. This is the profit percentage you want to achieve.ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode attribute. Percent Markup - Standard CostMarkupStandardCost = 5The price is calculated as a percentage of the standard cost of the item. calculated price = standard cost x 100% + percentage Because the standard cost is updated periodically, the standard cost amount in this equation is an average and will not always be the same as the amount you paid most recently for the item.For each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes:Product.StandardCost attribute. Every time that you update the standard cost, the price changes.ProductPriceLevel.Percentage attribute. This is the percent markup.ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode attribute. Percent Margin - Standard CostMarginStandardCost = 6The price is based on the profit percentage you want to achieve and the standard cost of the item. calculated price = standard cost + [(standard cost x percentage)/(100% - percentage)]Because the standard cost is updated periodically, the standard cost amount in this equation is an average and will not always be the same as the amount you paid most recently for the item. For each unit of measure for each product, you must enter data for the following attributes: Product.StandardCost attribute. Every time that you update the standard cost, the price changes.ProductPriceLevel.Percentage attribute. This is the profit percentage you want to achieve.ProductPriceLevel.RoundingPolicyCode attribute. To set the values for the ProductPriceLevel.PricingMethodCode attribute and the other product price level entity attributes, use the IOrganizationService.Update method, passing an instance of the ProductPriceLevel class. To set the values for the product attributes, use the methods in the Product class.See AlsoProductPriceLevel (price list item) entity messages and methodsProduct entity messages and methodsProduct catalog entitiesMicrosoft Dynamics 365
