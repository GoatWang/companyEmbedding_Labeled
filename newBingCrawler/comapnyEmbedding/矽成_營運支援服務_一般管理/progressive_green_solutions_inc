YAPHANK, N.Y., Nov. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Progressive Green Solutions, Inc. (OTC: PGSC) (the "Company"), today announced an update of its recent accomplishments.
Conversion of Insider Debt to Common Stock








"We are excited to announce that two members of the Board of Directors of the Company agreed to convert loans previously extended by them to the Company into common stock of the Company," said Eugene Fernandez, President and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. "Not only does this improve our balance sheet and reduce the amount of interest accrued on a quarterly basis, but this also sends a strong message that the Board of Directors believes in the future of the Company." The conversions were accomplished as follows:

On July 8, 2016, Stonehenge Holdings, LLC ("Stonehenge"), an entity controlled by Anthony Williams, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, agreed to retire $128,348 of previously advanced debt to the Company plus accrued interest into 1,426,089 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. Additionally, on September 26, 2016, Stonehenge agreed to convert $94,399 of previously advanced debt to the Company which includes accrued interest to the Company into 1,887,980 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 
On September 26, 2016, DGS Group LLC, an entity controlled by Eugene Fernandez, the Company's President and a member of the Board of Directors, agreed to convert $600,000 of debt into 12,000,000 shares of the Common Stock of the Company.

Acquisition of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc.
On October 12, 2016, Speyside Holdings LLC ("Speyside") completed the acquisition of the assets of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc., a crushed aggregate quarry located in Highland Mills, New York. Since April 2015, Speyside has managed Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc.'s quarry pursuant to a management agreement. 
"The acquisition of the assets of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc. is directly aligned with our strategic objectives to expand into the crushed aggregates market," said Eugene Fernandez, President and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. "The Highland Mills quarry is one of those rare gems as the quarry has a long useful life and it is near the robust New York Metropolitan markets." The acquisition of the assets of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc. and its related operations were accomplished as follows:

On October 6, 2016, CEM III LLC ("CEM") an entity that the Company indirectly owns twenty-six percent of acquired approximately 30 acres of real property in Highland Mills, New York to be used in conjunction with Speyside's operation of the Highland Mills quarry. 
On October 12, 2016, Speyside, Speyside Holdings II LLC, and BCM Speyside, LLC acquired the assets of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc. 
On October 12, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the assets of Highland Sand & Gravel, Inc., the Company's direct interest in Speyside and indirect interest in CEM was reduced to fifty-one percent and twenty-six percent respectively.

Reconditioning Services Agreement
On October 13, 2016, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Green Remanufacturing Solutions LLC ("GRS"), entered a return center services agreement with Fagor America, Inc. ("Fagor"), Spain's largest consumer appliance company and the fifth largest electrical appliance company in Europe. "The addition of the service agreement with Fagor is directly aligned with our strategic objectives to pivot GRS' business model," said Eugene Fernandez, President and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. "This is another step forward for GRS as we continue to expand into the consumer returns reconditioning industry."

It uses a zippered top which can be unzipped from the perimeter wall. With an effective R Value of 13, you can use the whole house fan cover to effectively seal and insulate your whole house fan. Want more R Value, just add insulation over and around the FanZip Insulator during seasonal downtime.  The FanZip® insulator prevents radiant heat from entering your home in the summer and leaving your heated areas in the winter. The Seal N Shield® FanZip® Insulator provides an effective seal against drafts, heat/air conditioning loss.  FanZip® comes in various standard sizes and custom sizes (call for quote)are available. 1 YEAR WARRANTY MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP

Unless your water heater's storage tank already has a high R-value of insulation (at least R-24), adding insulation to it can reduce standby heat losses by 25%–45%. This can save you up to 9% in water heating costs. Adding additional insulation to your water heater can substantially reduce your energy costs.

Seal N Shield®  Attic Stair Insulator --Our Best Seller--Tens of Thousands Sold!!
The Seal N Shield® Attic Stair Insulator is a zippered green building insulation cover manufactured in 
  the U.S.  The cover has a foam core with radiant barrier on both 
  sides to reflect radiant heat. The cover keeps the heat in your attic and out of your home in the 
  summer.  The cover keeps the heat in your home during the winter.  This deluxe insulation cover seals and 
  insulates your pull down stairs while eliminating potential trip hazards.  
  Its' low profile opening located at the attic entrance virtually eliminates trip hazards. The Seal N Shield® Attic Stair Insulator mounts 
  on the inside of the opening framework. This unique method of 
  installation seals and insulates the entire opening.  This ensures 
  a complete seal around the stairway frame which typically has up to a 
  one inch crack around the stairway frame.  During installation the 
  installer of the stairway has to use spacers around the stairway frame 
  to attach it to the structural framework leaving an opening for air 
  leaks around the sides and ends of the stairway frame.  This unique method of 
  installation eliminates the need for wood decking around the top of the 
  access opening.  The Seal N Shield® Stair  insulated cover is versatile and can be opened to 
  the side or rear to allow unobstructed access to your attic space.  
  Installation is easy and fast.  View our two minute       installation video at the top of this page.
