MMRGlobal, Inc. (MMR), incorporated on January 21, 2000, is engaged in offering a suite of online products, which enable consumers and professionals to manage medical records and various other documents in their life and business, whether paper-based or digital. The Company's online products include MyMedicalRecords.com, which an online personal health record (PHR) system for the entire family, including pets; MyEsafeDepositBox, which is an online secure document storage system; MyMedicalRecordsMD (MMRPro), which is an integrated scanning and Web-based document management solution for healthcare professionals, and private-label PHR and MyEsafeDepositBox storage solutions.MyMedicalRecordsThe Company's consumer product, MyMedicalRecords, is a Web-based PHR system, which allows documents, images and voice mail messages to be transmitted in and out of MMR's system using a range of methods, including fax, voice and file upload. MMR's consumer's MyMedicalRecords PHR can store and maintain medical records that are sent from any of the consumer's healthcare providers. A MyMedicalRecords PHR can receive and store medical records in a range of formats, including image, voice, and discrete data in Health Level-7 (HL7), extensible markup language (XML) or other formats, which are exported or communicated from electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical record (EMR) or telemedicine systems. The account holder receives a notification at the same time new information is received in the Company's system from their healthcare provider. This notification can be sent to over three different user e-mail addresses (including text-enabled cell phones and smartphones).The Company's PHR is secured not only by a unique user identity document (ID), but also by multiple passwords. Consumers can access their files through the Internet or a Web-enabled phone, and using a customized filing system can categorize, annotate and file their records. It enables a consumer to print, download, e-mail or fax records from PHR, sharing this information with healthcare providers and others. The Company's mobile application provides access to the MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service, allowing patients to access their PHR in a mobile optimized environment. MMR is engaged in selling its MyMedicalRecords PHR product directly to consumers, corporations, physicians, small hospitals, surgery centers, other healthcare professionals, including nursing associations, retail pharmacies, veterinarians, and to affinity organizations as a value-added service for their members or clients. It also introduced a Prepaid Personal Health Record Kit, which is marketed through pharmacy retailers, healthcare professionals, home healthcare agencies and facilities, and patient advocates. Its PHR is also offered both through the MyMedicalRecords Website and as a private-labeled product.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product is bilingual in English and Spanish and allows users to store and segregate information for over 10 family members in a single account. It provides portability for the user, which means MyMedicalRecords PHR can stay with the individual through changes in doctors, jobs and insurers. Healthcare providers can transmit documents to a patient's MyMedicalRecords PHR mailbox without making any changes to existing patient or practice management software.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product can be used to provide storage for a range of records, including patient charts, notes and medical histories; vaccination and immunization records; lab reports and test results, including any images (or, if offered by a laboratory, links that the user can use to access the laboratory's stored images); copies of prescription orders; x-ray results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by a radiology provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); electrocardiogram (EKG) results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by an imaging provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); birth certificates, living wills, healthcare powers of attorney and advance directives; lab report and pharmacy records through 4medica, and telemedicine data through Alcatel-Lucent ng Connect. In addition, users can store legal, insurance and financial documents, as well as copies of identification documents, such as passports and driver's license in their MyMedicalRecords PHR account. It also offers a value-added service to MyMedicalRecords PHR, which the Company refers to as Personal Touch. When a user enrolls in Personal Touch, their records are collected on their behalf and organized and placed into their PHR. Personal Touch is included in certain of the Company's subscription services and is also sold separately as an additional service from the basic MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product offers users multiple ways to enter and maintain their personal medical information, including by fax, voice, digital file upload and online annotations, as well as through customized Web service links. In addition to the core document conversion, storage and retrieval capabilities, the Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product provides a layer of tools to help users manage their personal and/or their families' medical records. These tools include integration with electronic medical record systems and laboratory reporting services, forms management and electronic signature, ability to attach received faxes to e-mail notifications, health history, appointment calendar feature, prescription history and refill reminder feature, drug information and interaction database, voice reminders and messaging, secondary passwords on selected file folders, emergency login for physicians and other emergency response personnel, and telemedicine. Its mobile applications are also available for the MyMedicalRecords PHR for Android tablets, smartphones and on the iPhone/iPad Operating System (iOS) platform.MyEsafeDepositBoxThe Company's MyEsafeDepositBox service is geared towards small businesses, the financial, insurance and legal services industries. MyEsafeDepositBox is based on the same technology and architecture as the MyMedicalRecords PHR product. MyEsafeDepositBox provides online storage for medical records and other financial, legal and insurance documents, such as wills and advance directives. MyEsafeDepositBox.com is used as an online safe and serves various household or businesses by storing legal, insurance and financial documents, such as copies of insurance policies, deeds of trust, passport, birth certificate, photos of property and other documents, in addition to medical records that are retrieved in the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood or fire.The Company's MyEsafeDepositBox product offers online storage due to the Company's telecommunications platform, which enables users to fax records directly into their MyEsafeDepositBox account. It also permits service providers, such as insurance agents or lenders, to fax documents directly into a user's online account. It also enables sorting, storing and managing records, while also uses a form text search to find records stored in their account with specific annotations. It provides private label branding of this product to banks, insurance companies, escrow services and other financial and legal businesses. The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product are marketed through various channels. MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product focuses primarily on channels, including corporate accounts; insurance companies; affinity groups (such as alumni organizations and other membership organizations) and discount health benefit membership groups; charitable and critical illness organizations; legal, accounting, mortgage and other organizations, and direct to consumers.MyMedicalRecordsMDThe Company's MMRPro product provides physician offices with a solution of digitizing paper-based medical records, as well as providing doctors the access to those records through a private portal at MyMedicalRecordsMD.com. In addition, MMRPro features an integrated e-Prescribe automated drug order entry system and automatically deploys a patient's records to a free patient portal, MMRPatientView.com, where patients can view and print out their records. MMRPro also includes its own Stimulus Program, which allows physicians the opportunity to earn administrative reimbursements when their patients upgrade from the free MMRPatientView.com portal to a paid MyMedicalRecords PHR account. MMRPro includes all hardware, software and system management.The Company has introduced a new version of MMRPro, MMRPro Plus, which allows the solution to work with virtually any scanner. MMRPro Plus installs as a client on an office computer instead of being built into the intelligence of the scanner. It offers the same features and functionality as the original MMRPro and therefore is ideal for officers where scanners already have been installed. MMR's MMRPro is marketed to physicians, particularly small group and sole practitioners; other healthcare professionals, such as dentists, veterinarians and chiropractors; community hospitals and other clinics; surgery centers and specialty clinics, and EMR and EHR vendors. MMRPro features include Integration with EMR systems, integrated e-Prescribe module, integrated fax messaging, voice messaging, practice-specific branding and content, practice-specific forms management, dynamic communication with doctor's practice management system and patient view.The Company competes with NoMoreClipboard.com, Dossia, WebMD Health Manager, Zweena Health and MiVIA.

MMRGlobal, Inc. (MMR), incorporated on January 21, 2000, is engaged in offering a suite of online products, which enable consumers and professionals to manage medical records and various other documents in their life and business, whether paper-based or digital. The Company's online products include MyMedicalRecords.com, which an online personal health record (PHR) system for the entire family, including pets; MyEsafeDepositBox, which is an online secure document storage system; MyMedicalRecordsMD (MMRPro), which is an integrated scanning and Web-based document management solution for healthcare professionals, and private-label PHR and MyEsafeDepositBox storage solutions.MyMedicalRecordsThe Company's consumer product, MyMedicalRecords, is a Web-based PHR system, which allows documents, images and voice mail messages to be transmitted in and out of MMR's system using a range of methods, including fax, voice and file upload. MMR's consumer's MyMedicalRecords PHR can store and maintain medical records that are sent from any of the consumer's healthcare providers. A MyMedicalRecords PHR can receive and store medical records in a range of formats, including image, voice, and discrete data in Health Level-7 (HL7), extensible markup language (XML) or other formats, which are exported or communicated from electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical record (EMR) or telemedicine systems. The account holder receives a notification at the same time new information is received in the Company's system from their healthcare provider. This notification can be sent to over three different user e-mail addresses (including text-enabled cell phones and smartphones).The Company's PHR is secured not only by a unique user identity document (ID), but also by multiple passwords. Consumers can access their files through the Internet or a Web-enabled phone, and using a customized filing system can categorize, annotate and file their records. It enables a consumer to print, download, e-mail or fax records from PHR, sharing this information with healthcare providers and others. The Company's mobile application provides access to the MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service, allowing patients to access their PHR in a mobile optimized environment. MMR is engaged in selling its MyMedicalRecords PHR product directly to consumers, corporations, physicians, small hospitals, surgery centers, other healthcare professionals, including nursing associations, retail pharmacies, veterinarians, and to affinity organizations as a value-added service for their members or clients. It also introduced a Prepaid Personal Health Record Kit, which is marketed through pharmacy retailers, healthcare professionals, home healthcare agencies and facilities, and patient advocates. Its PHR is also offered both through the MyMedicalRecords Website and as a private-labeled product.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product is bilingual in English and Spanish and allows users to store and segregate information for over 10 family members in a single account. It provides portability for the user, which means MyMedicalRecords PHR can stay with the individual through changes in doctors, jobs and insurers. Healthcare providers can transmit documents to a patient's MyMedicalRecords PHR mailbox without making any changes to existing patient or practice management software.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product can be used to provide storage for a range of records, including patient charts, notes and medical histories; vaccination and immunization records; lab reports and test results, including any images (or, if offered by a laboratory, links that the user can use to access the laboratory's stored images); copies of prescription orders; x-ray results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by a radiology provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); electrocardiogram (EKG) results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by an imaging provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); birth certificates, living wills, healthcare powers of attorney and advance directives; lab report and pharmacy records through 4medica, and telemedicine data through Alcatel-Lucent ng Connect. In addition, users can store legal, insurance and financial documents, as well as copies of identification documents, such as passports and driver's license in their MyMedicalRecords PHR account. It also offers a value-added service to MyMedicalRecords PHR, which the Company refers to as Personal Touch. When a user enrolls in Personal Touch, their records are collected on their behalf and organized and placed into their PHR. Personal Touch is included in certain of the Company's subscription services and is also sold separately as an additional service from the basic MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product offers users multiple ways to enter and maintain their personal medical information, including by fax, voice, digital file upload and online annotations, as well as through customized Web service links. In addition to the core document conversion, storage and retrieval capabilities, the Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product provides a layer of tools to help users manage their personal and/or their families' medical records. These tools include integration with electronic medical record systems and laboratory reporting services, forms management and electronic signature, ability to attach received faxes to e-mail notifications, health history, appointment calendar feature, prescription history and refill reminder feature, drug information and interaction database, voice reminders and messaging, secondary passwords on selected file folders, emergency login for physicians and other emergency response personnel, and telemedicine. Its mobile applications are also available for the MyMedicalRecords PHR for Android tablets, smartphones and on the iPhone/iPad Operating System (iOS) platform.MyEsafeDepositBoxThe Company's MyEsafeDepositBox service is geared towards small businesses, the financial, insurance and legal services industries. MyEsafeDepositBox is based on the same technology and architecture as the MyMedicalRecords PHR product. MyEsafeDepositBox provides online storage for medical records and other financial, legal and insurance documents, such as wills and advance directives. MyEsafeDepositBox.com is used as an online safe and serves various household or businesses by storing legal, insurance and financial documents, such as copies of insurance policies, deeds of trust, passport, birth certificate, photos of property and other documents, in addition to medical records that are retrieved in the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood or fire.The Company's MyEsafeDepositBox product offers online storage due to the Company's telecommunications platform, which enables users to fax records directly into their MyEsafeDepositBox account. It also permits service providers, such as insurance agents or lenders, to fax documents directly into a user's online account. It also enables sorting, storing and managing records, while also uses a form text search to find records stored in their account with specific annotations. It provides private label branding of this product to banks, insurance companies, escrow services and other financial and legal businesses. The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product are marketed through various channels. MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product focuses primarily on channels, including corporate accounts; insurance companies; affinity groups (such as alumni organizations and other membership organizations) and discount health benefit membership groups; charitable and critical illness organizations; legal, accounting, mortgage and other organizations, and direct to consumers.MyMedicalRecordsMDThe Company's MMRPro product provides physician offices with a solution of digitizing paper-based medical records, as well as providing doctors the access to those records through a private portal at MyMedicalRecordsMD.com. In addition, MMRPro features an integrated e-Prescribe automated drug order entry system and automatically deploys a patient's records to a free patient portal, MMRPatientView.com, where patients can view and print out their records. MMRPro also includes its own Stimulus Program, which allows physicians the opportunity to earn administrative reimbursements when their patients upgrade from the free MMRPatientView.com portal to a paid MyMedicalRecords PHR account. MMRPro includes all hardware, software and system management.The Company has introduced a new version of MMRPro, MMRPro Plus, which allows the solution to work with virtually any scanner. MMRPro Plus installs as a client on an office computer instead of being built into the intelligence of the scanner. It offers the same features and functionality as the original MMRPro and therefore is ideal for officers where scanners already have been installed. MMR's MMRPro is marketed to physicians, particularly small group and sole practitioners; other healthcare professionals, such as dentists, veterinarians and chiropractors; community hospitals and other clinics; surgery centers and specialty clinics, and EMR and EHR vendors. MMRPro features include Integration with EMR systems, integrated e-Prescribe module, integrated fax messaging, voice messaging, practice-specific branding and content, practice-specific forms management, dynamic communication with doctor's practice management system and patient view.The Company competes with NoMoreClipboard.com, Dossia, WebMD Health Manager, Zweena Health and MiVIA.

 Educational Background



Undergraduate Degree 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.                




 


Vanderbilt University Law School

                  Located on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee, the law school combines the advantages of a stimulating university community, a top-tier faculty, a small, carefully selected student body, and a vibrant, livable city.

Known for offering a rigorous academic program in a collegial, supportive atmosphere, Vanderbilt Law School attracts law students and faculty seeking a first-rate academic institution that also affords an excellent quality of life.

In 2002, the law school completed an extensive renovation and expansion project, and Vanderbilt now offers its students a state-of-the-art facility with wireless internet access throughout, situated on a park-like campus that is a national arboretum.

MMR is a real product. The "kit" is a great tool. Emergency card, Dr. authorisation letter, Dr. release form, sticker on D.L., secure site with $1M insurance coverage, individual cards for each member of family up to 10, etc.  All can purchase it on drugstore.com right now. I suggest everyone interested get one and go thru the system.... You'll find it a real product.  It's not a scam but something of great value.  Traveling overseas ? or if you have an auto accident and ambulance takes you to a hospital.... Drs. will have immediate access to your medical conditions, meds you're taking and records. You'll thank me after reviewing what MMR offers.  Ther is NO other company offer similar service/product. Go MMR.
