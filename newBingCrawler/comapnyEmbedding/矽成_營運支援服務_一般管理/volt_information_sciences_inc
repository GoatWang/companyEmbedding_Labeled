Corporate Profile

Volt Information Sciences, Inc. is an international provider of staffing services, outsourcing solutions, and information technology infrastructure services. 


Our staffing services include providing contingent workers and personnel recruitment services, supporting primarily professional administration, technical, information technology, and engineering positions. Our managed services oversee the recruitment and management of contingent workers of all types from multiple service providers.

Our outsourcing solutions consist of project-based IT and technology services including development, quality assurance, localization, and technical support, provided in our testing and call center facilities and onsite at client locations.

Our information technology infrastructure services provide server, storage, network, and desktop IT hardware maintenance, data center and network monitoring, and operations support.

History

What makes a company great? It’s a question our founders asked over sixty years ago when Volt began as a small technical writing business. In its earliest days, Volt played a key role in American innovation, including providing technical documentation for the Atlas Missile Project. As the company grew, we saw an opportunity to fill a critical need for our clients by providing contingent personnel services and this part of the business quickly developed into the core of Volt’s service offerings.


Volt continued to expand in the 1960s, adding offices on both coasts and building relationships with some of the earliest and best known technology companies in the 1970s and 1980s, many of which continue today. The world has changed so much since our company began in 1950, and these changes have driven opportunity at Volt: We’ve established a global footprint as one of the industry’s top staffing and talent management providers and created one of the world’s leading mobile and game testing businesses with VMC.

While our awards, diverse history, and long-standing client relationships with some of the world’s most respected companies demonstrate our growth, the key to our success is our continual focus on our clients and employees. We look forward to further strategic innovation while respecting the roots of our company, because we still believe what our two founders, brothers William and Jerry Shaw, realized long ago: Business runs on talent, today and always.

Working at Volt
Every day at Volt, we see firsthand how one employee can make a difference for a business, so we’re always looking for skilled people who want to make a difference for Volt and our clients. We are committed to providing better service than our competitors, so we are regularly seeking motivated professionals with experience in either staffing or one of the industries we serve. If that sounds like you, please contact us.

We know you have a choice of where you work, so we do everything we can to make Volt a first choice for talented specialists. We offer a diverse workplace that encourages collaboration, long-term career paths, and the chance to work with an array of great companies and inspired people. We encourage you to search our open positions and see if Volt is the right fit for you.
