PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:
    


      Teleperformance (Paris:RCF), the worldwide leader in outsourced 
      omnichannel customer experience management, today announced that it has 
      entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire LanguageLine 
      Solutions LLC from ABRY Partners and minority equity owners.
    

      LanguageLine Solutions is the US market leader in over-the-phone and 
      video interpretation solutions to a wide range of organizations in the 
      healthcare, insurance, financial services, communications and government 
      sectors. Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Monterey, California, 
      LanguageLine Solutions had revenue of US$388 million and adjusted EBITDA 
      of US$147 million in 2015.
    

Daniel Julien, Executive Chairman of Teleperformance, and Paulo César 
      Vasques, Teleperformance Chief Executive Officer, commented: “LanguageLine 
      Solutions delivers mission critical services to a large array of clients 
      in verticals that we already service in customer service and technical 
      support. It is a superb organization that supports 25,000 clients 
      across the US, Canada and the UK in more than 240 languages with a 
      sophisticated growing network of approximately 8,000 interpreters. This 
      acquisition will reinforce and boost Teleperformance’s global leadership 
      as a provider of high end value-added services, and will positively 
      impact Teleperformance’s profitability profile. We intend, 
      together with LanguageLine Solutions’ seasoned leadership team, to 
      gradually expand these lines of service across Teleperformance’s 
      geographic footprint.”


“When completed, the deal will create immediate value for 
      Teleperformance shareholders as it is expected to be accretive to 
      earnings per share by around 10% on a pro forma basis for 2016”, 
      they added.


Peggy Koenig, Managing Partner and Co-CEO at ABRY Partners, said: “LanguageLine 
      has been a long-held and important investment for ABRY. Management 
      has grown revenue, diversified the product lines and increased 
      profitability meaningfully over the course of our investment, and we are 
      thrilled that the Company has found a perfect home within 
      Teleperformance. We wish the management team and Teleperformance 
      continued success going forward.”


“I would like to heartily thank ABRY Partners for having been such 
      great shareholders, supporting LanguageLine’s mission of enabling 
      communications in order to empower relationships as well as our 
      aggressive growth strategy. We know that Teleperformance, with 
      its global culture and footprint, is the perfect partner to help us 
      write a great new chapter in the history of the language access 
      solutions industry. The LanguageLine leadership team is excited 
      to join the Teleperformance group in order to expand the reach of our 
      business and to help us to continue to provide total and complete client 
      satisfaction”, added Scott W. Klein, LanguageLine Solutions Chief 
      Executive Officer.


      The consideration for the transaction will be US$1,522 million at 
      closing. The acquisition will be fully financed through a debt financing 
      provided by Crédit Agricole, HSBC and Société Générale. Paul Hastings 
      LLP and Linklaters LLP acted as legal advisors to Teleperformance in 
      conjunction respectively with the acquisition and the financing.
    

      Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisors to 
      LanguageLine Solutions on the transaction and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted 
      as legal advisor.
    

      The transaction is expected to close before year end, subject to receipt 
      of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
