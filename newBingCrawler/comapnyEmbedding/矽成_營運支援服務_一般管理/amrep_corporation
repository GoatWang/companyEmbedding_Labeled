            AMREP SELLS ITS NEWSSTAND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES BUSINESS AND ITS PRODUCT PACKAGING AND FULFILLMENT SERVICES BUSINESS
          

            Princeton, New Jersey, February 9, 2015 - AMREP Corporation (NYSE:AXR) today reported that it 
			has sold its Newsstand Distribution Services business and its Product Packaging and Fulfillment 
			Services business pursuant to the sale of capital stock to entities controlled by Michael P. Duloc. 
			The closing of the sale occurred on February 9, 2015.  
          

            The buyers paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million, which consisted of $400,000 of cash paid
			on the closing and $1.6 million paid by execution of a secured promissory note. The Newsstand Distribution
			Services business and the Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business will retain all of their
			third party pre-closing assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including the negative working
			capital of the Newsstand Distribution Services business, which totaled $12,672,000 at October 31, 2014.
		    AMREP expects to recognize a pre-tax gain on its financial statements as a result of the transaction
			in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 which it estimates will range from approximately $8 million
			to $10 million.   
          

            Revenues from land sales at AMREP Southwest were $2,513,000 and $2,897,000 for the second 
            quarter and first six months of 2015 compared to $1,196,000 and $1,424,000 for the same 
            periods of 2014. The average gross profit percentage on land sales was 12.9% and 16.8% for 
            the second quarter and first six months of 2015 compared to 16.5% for each of the same two 
            periods of 2014. Revenues, average selling prices and related gross profits from land sales 
            can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors, including the nature 
            and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land being sold.
          

            Prior to the closing, Mr. Duloc was the chief executive officer and president of AMREP's Newsstand
			Distribution Services business and Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business and certain
			other subsidiaries of AMREP.  
          

            "After many years in the magazine distribution and product fulfillment businesses, we are pleased
			that this transaction will allow AMREP to focus primarily on its real estate and subscription fulfillment
			services businesses to drive shareholder value," said Edward B. Cloues, II, Chairman of AMREP. "This
			disposition will sharpen our focus and strengthen AMREP's balance sheet by eliminating the negative working
		    capital overhang."
          

            Additional details on the sale transaction are provided in AMREP's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the 
			Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2015. 
          

About AMREP - AMREP Corporation's Palm Coast Data subsidiary provides subscription related services to
			publishers, membership organizations and others, its Kable Staffing subsidiary provides temporary staffing 
			services and its AMREP Southwest subsidiary is a major holder of real estate in New Mexico.
          

Forward-Looking Statements - This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements, including 
			statements with regard to the expected gain, if any, to be recognized as a result of the transaction and the 
			expected focus of AMREP in the future. Words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," and "future" or similar 
			expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject 
			to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors could cause actual 
			results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, and some of these factors 
			are discussed in the filings AMREP makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMREP undertakes no 
			obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
