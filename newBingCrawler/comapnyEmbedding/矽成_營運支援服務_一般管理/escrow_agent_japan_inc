Why Software Escrow?


Verification Services








What is a software escrow?
A software escrow is a contract that requires an escrow agent to keep physical possession of source code for a software product and release it to a licensed user, reseller or investor under specific circumstances specified in the escrow agreement.


Who needs a software escrow?
If you are a licensed user of a software product that requires maintenance, ongoing development, or customization, then keeping the product’s source code in escrow can protect you and the ability to perform any required maintenance.


Escrow for Developers and Investors
Software developers can require a source code escrow when working on software owned by someone else to assure continued access to the product’s source code. Financers of software products can use a software escrow to improve the quality of their collateral security.







Escrow Plans




Single User Plan
Ideal for:
Licensed users of highly customized software.
Signed by:
The licensor, licensed user and escrow agent.
How it works:
A copy of source code is held exclusively for that particular user.
Learn More >




Multi User Plan
Ideal for:
Developers and distributors of packaged software.
Signed by:
The licensor and escrow agent only.
How it works:
The licensor designates users, and each of them enrolls under the agreement.
Learn More >




Multi Supplier Plan
Ideal for:
Businesses with licenses from multiple software suppliers.
Signed by:
The licensed user and escrow agent.
How it works:
Each supplier adopts the master terms when they deliver the product.
Learn More >




Investor Security Plan
Ideal for:
Investors who are funding new software development.
Signed by:
The investor, developer and escrow agent.
How it works:
It gives investors collateral security in case of a default under the lending agreement.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
