IRVINE, Calif., May 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Content syndication and monetization company, Adaptive Medias, Inc. (OTC-QB: ADTM), a leader in programmatic advertising across mobile, video and online display, announced today that it has entered into a purchase agreement to close three separate private placements, totaling up to $4.5 million, from a private investor.
In the first round of funding, the Company has agreed to sell an aggregate of 1,183,432 million shares of its common stock at $1.69 per share, for total gross proceeds of $2.0 million. The company is expected to close two additional private placement capital raises from the same investor for $1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which would take place at later dates. The additional placements are contingent on closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement.
Adaptive Medias intends to use the funds to continue to grow its leadership, sales, and engineering teams to deliver innovative product enhancements to its all-in-one digital monetization platform Media Graph.
"We view Media Graph as the nexus of digital advertising and content monetization for the video and mobile sectors," said Jim Waltz, Acting COO of Adaptive Medias, Inc. "This, combined with our advanced video player, which we have optimized for an enhanced mobile experience, will enable us to continue to capitalize on the accelerating trend we see for increased video viewership by users on their smartphones and tablets."
Waltz continued, "Adaptive Medias, Inc. is fortunate enough to have a group of key, strategic investors that firmly believe in our technology. These funds will enable us to continue to invest in maintaining our best-in-class solution in a highly fragmented digital video and mobile space."

IRVINE, Calif., May 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Content syndication and monetization company, Adaptive Medias, Inc. (OTCQB: ADTM), a leader in programmatic advertising across mobile, video and online display, today announced results for its first quarter, ended March 31, 2015.
First Quarter Revenues Increase 60%
First quarter revenues totaled a record $1.17 million, an increase of 60% from $730,000 in the first quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase reflects revenues from the July 2014 acquisition of Media Graph in addition to early results following the launch of the Company's technology platform. In addition, online advertising spend tends to be lowest in the first quarter of any year, leading to the sequential decline in revenues from fourth quarter 2014. 
In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA equaled ($6.3 million) compared with ($2.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and ($3.1 million) in the third quarter of 2014.  EBITDA in the first quarter was increased due to a one-time settlement expense of $3.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the aforementioned settlement, and a one-time write-down of intangibles made during the fourth quarter of 2014, continued to improve on a sequential basis reflecting the Company's move from the development stage to commercialization along with its commitment to expense management.    
"Adaptive Medias' first quarter reflects our commitment to consistent execution.  Our focus on strong revenue growth and responsible spending allowed the company to improve its gross margins sequentially and reduce its losses in the seasonally soft first quarter for advertising spend," said Jim Waltz, Acting Chief Operating Officer.  "Additionally, we are seeing increased spending by existing customers and an increase in the number of active customers adopting our solution. We believe that these trends reflect growing appreciation for our technology's efficacy, simplicity and flexibility."
Company Raises Up to $4.5 Million in Private Placement
Waltz continued, "Adaptive Medias, Inc. is fortunate enough to have a group of key, strategic investors that firmly believe in our technology.  As a result, on May 5, 2015, we signed an agreement for up to $4.5 million in additional growth capital to be delivered in up to three rounds. These funds would enable us to continue to invest in maintaining our best-in-class solution in a highly fragmented digital video and mobile space."
In the first round of funding, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,183,432 shares of its common stock at $1.69 per share, for total gross proceeds of $2.0 million. The Company may close up to two additional private placement capital raises from the same investor for $1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which would take place at later dates. The additional placements are contingent on closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement.  Adaptive Media intends to use the funds to continue to grow its leadership, sales, and engineering teams to deliver innovative product enhancements to its all-in-one digital monetization platform Media Graph.
Gross profit for the first quarter amounted to $197,000, or 17% of revenues compared to $287,000, or 39% of revenues in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in gross profit margin in 2015 versus 2014 reflects the proportion of lower-margined advertising revenue as a result of the Media Graph acquisition compared with higher margined fee business expected from its recently launched technology platform.  Despite the sequential decrease in revenues and gross profit, gross profit margins increased on a sequential basis in the first quarter from 9% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
As a result of the expansion of business, operating expenses increased to $6,937,025 for the three months ended March 31, 2015, compared to $1,427,564 in the comparable period of 2014, an increase of $5,796,705 or 508%. This increase is due to a one time settlement expense of $3,768,485 as discussed in footnote 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements within the Form 10Q filed for the period ended March 31, 2015.
With the exception of the onetime settlement expense, general and administrative expenses remained largely stable on a sequential basis totaling $1.35 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared with $1.31 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
We report adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.
