CEO Message













Since the start of 2015, the Group has been keenly aware of the rapid changes taking place at an unprecedented rate in Japan’s capital markets. The key word that is taking center stage in the change is “shareholders.” We are faced with a surge in the power and borderless presence of shareholders, in concert with government-led reforms such as the introduction of the Corporate Governance Code, which is increasing the pressure on Japan’s core listed companies, our clients, to urgently conduct capital policy reforms. The Group, as a leading expert in responding to these changes, is achieving success in consulting services for new capital policies (SR [shareholder relations] Consulting), by fully utilizing its cutting-age intelligence functions unfettered by conventional ideas. Looking to the future, the Group will consistently provide consulting, investment banking, disclosure and stock transfer agency services based on its unique SR Consulting, the main pillar of its business. We deeply appreciate our shareholders for their support over the years and will endeavor to further enhance our rate of growth. We, therefore, ask our shareholders for their continued support in these endeavors.
