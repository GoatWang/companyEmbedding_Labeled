PA System Reviews from Our Customers



"I am an auctioneer in NC and I have used the Portable Buddy for 14 years with great success thru wind, snow and rain! My colleagues swear by the old stand by the half mile hailer, but I love my Buddy." 

Audio Portable Buddy
Linda Hoke - Auctioneer



"I have loved my new portable wireless sound system purchased from AmpliVox. The company has great products and the staff are really easy to work with!" 

Digital Audio Travel Partner
Gabriel Castillo, Belvidere Park District



"Just wanted you to know that the Amplivox system that we use for events (Parades, Public Gatherings, Party’s, etc…) is wonderful! It makes each event a better event! Thank you for your product!" 

Digital Audio Travel Partner
Jimmy Harris, Mayor of Brevard NC



"I just got my portable buddy today and must tell you guys at AmpliVox that this is by far the best PA I have ever used in the past 21 years of being an entertainer... This system has made my life so much easier." 

Audio Portable Buddy
Todd McKinney, Hewitt, TX - Magician



"I have been using AmpliVox portable PA systems for almost 15 years and wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the quality of your company’s products."

Half-Mile Hailer Kits
Larry Able, Master Level Starter - USA Track and Field



"We've tried others and now - with over 30 Beltblasters being used by our staff - it's the only small group amplifier that we trust... we can now accommodate larger groups on our walking tours *and* everyone can hear us."

BeltBlaster Pro
David Schargel, Portland Walking Tours, Oregon  



"The SW915 was much louder, much clearer, with much better fidelity! We filled up the Banquet room with just one SW915, and with power to spare."

Digital Audio Travel Partner
Roger Arendt All Points Sound



"Easy and quick to assemble, we were able to move and use it in several areas of our race with no difficulty. The sound quality was excellent with no distortion... definitely enhanced the day for us and our participants. "

Half Mile Hailer
Stacy Jargowsky - SBR Multisports



"Thanks for your patience and a fine product. (Ambassador)... We really do appreciate the quality of the multi-media lectern."

Ambassador Lectern
Todd M. Brosz - Lt. Colonel, 557 Flying Team



"Your model seemed to fit the bill of being much more 'commercial industrial' which in the end is what made the decision. We have been nothing but pleased with the results!"

Megaphones & Bullhorns
Ben Sowle - RW Troxell



"Our Rotary Club uses the AmpliVox Voice Carrier at the cemetery for our Veteran's Day Services. We like being able to use a CD in the amplifier to play taps. We can speak and the music quality is wonderful."

Voice Carrier
Rotary Club Member - Via Telephone



"I love the Audio Traveler. Without a doubt the best PA system out there and with the added portability which I need the purchase was a no brainer, much prefer the battery pack to piles of cords."
