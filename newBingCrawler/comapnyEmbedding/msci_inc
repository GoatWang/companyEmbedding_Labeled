History[edit]
In 1968, Capital International published indices covering the global stock market for non-U.S. markets. In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes.[6] By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank and Standard & Poor's.[7] After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed.[7] In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra.[8] In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI.[9] This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007.[10] The divestment was completed in 2009.[11] The company is headquartered in New York City.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
MSCI formally acquired both RiskMetrics Group, Inc.[13] and Measurisk[14] in 2010, as well as Investment Property Databank in 2012.[15] In 2013 MSCI acquired Investor Force from ICG Group (formerly Internet Capital Group) in 2013.[16] In August 2014, MSCI acquired GMI Ratings.[17]
Indices[edit]
The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969 and include MSCI World[18] and MSCI EAFE.[19] Initially, the company used eight factors in developing its indexes: momentum, volatility, value, size, growth, size nonlinearity, liquidity and financial leverage.[20]

History[edit]
In 1968, Capital International published indices covering the global stock market for non-U.S. markets. In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes.[6] By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank and Standard & Poor's.[7] After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed.[7] In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra.[8] In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI.[9] This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007.[10] The divestment was completed in 2009.[11] The company is headquartered in New York City.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
MSCI formally acquired both RiskMetrics Group, Inc.[13] and Measurisk[14] in 2010, as well as Investment Property Databank in 2012.[15] In 2013 MSCI acquired Investor Force from ICG Group (formerly Internet Capital Group) in 2013.[16] In August 2014, MSCI acquired GMI Ratings.[17]
Indices[edit]
The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969 and include MSCI World[18] and MSCI EAFE.[19] Initially, the company used eight factors in developing its indexes: momentum, volatility, value, size, growth, size nonlinearity, liquidity and financial leverage.[20]

MSCI is a proud signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.

We are proud that some of our largest offices, representing nearly 70% of our global headcount, have achieved LEED and BREEAM Certifications.  Our U.S. based data centers follow best in class power usage effectiveness (PUE) practices, resulting in PUE that exceeds the industry average by nearly 34%.             Our History  Our long history has allowed us to build extensive databases of proprietary index, risk and ESG data, as well as accumulate valuable historical market data, which is difficult to replicate and provides us with a substantial competitive advantage.     Timeline    1969   MSCI was a pioneer in developing the market for global equity indexes. We began licensing our first equity index products in 1969.          1998   We were incorporated in 1998 and until we became a public company in November 2007 our only two shareholders were Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International. We became a fully independent, stand-alone public company in May 2009.          2004   In June 2004, we acquired Barra, a provider of portfolio risk analytics tools that launched its first risk analytics products in 1975. This broadened our product range beyond index products. Barra also owned FEA.         2010   In June 2010, we acquired RiskMetrics Group, a leading provider of risk management and governance products and services. In addition to this core product line, RiskMetrics owned Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS), a pioneer in the development of policy-based proxy voting recommendations. We sold ISS in April 2014. RiskMetrics also owned the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA), Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. and KLD Research and Analytics. We sold the CFRA product line in March 2013. Innovest and KLD Research are now known as MSCI ESG Research. Through MSCI ESG Research, we provide our clients with research reports and analytical tools covering environmental, social and governance investment criteria.           In July 2010, we acquired Measurisk, a provider of risk transparency and risk measurement tools for hedge fund investors. With our clients demanding increasing levels of transparency from their hedge fund managers, this acquisition helped us develop a broad platform and set the standard for analyzing and reporting hedge fund risk. Measurisk’s products are now part of our hedge fund risk transparency offering.       2012   In November 2012, we acquired real estate performance measurement group IPD. The acquisition of IPD expanded MSCI’s multi-asset class offering by facilitating the integration of private real estate assets into our models, as well as adding a family of real estate indexes to MSCI’s suite of equity indexes.        2013   In January 2013, we acquired InvestorForce, a leading provider of performance reporting tools to the institutional investment community in the United States. The InvestorForce offering enables us to provide consultants with integrated, daily monitoring, analysis of and reporting on institutional assets.        2014   In August 2014, we acquired Governance Holdings Co. (GMI Ratings), a provider of corporate governance research and ratings to institutional investors, banks, insurers, auditors, regulators and corporations seeking to incorporate ESG factors into risk assessment and decision-making. This acquisition enhanced our existing platform of ESG research and tools, allowing us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of ESG products and services to our clients.     2015 In October 2015, we acquired all of the assets of Insignis, a leading provider of daily automated collection, aggregation and management of financial data. We believe this acquisition will help us further automate the collection and integration of data across our risk and performance management platforms.                  Valuing Diversity and Inclusion  We are a global organization but we work as one team. The Company recognizes and values the diverse backgrounds and unique skill sets of all of us. MSCI is committed to developing a diverse workforce and maintaining an inclusive environment for every individual.
