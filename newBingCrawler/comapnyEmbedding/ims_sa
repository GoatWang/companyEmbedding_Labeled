Features & Benefits



Components

The Integrated Measurement System R&S® IMS is a complete EMS test system for compliance tests in accordance with commercial, military and automotive standards from 9 kHz to 3 GHz. 



Signal generation

The analog modulation types AM, FM, φM and PM are available. The optional Generator Interlock Relay R&S® IMS-B3 makes it possible to insert a 50 Ω termination rather than the generator signal if an interlock loop is open.



Power measurement

The Power Sensor R&S® NRP-Z91 is used to measure forward and reflected power and to monitor, for example, injected current in the case of bulk current injection (BCI). A fast, wear-free PIN diode switch allows switching between forward power, reflected power and monitoring. It is also used for system calibration. Additional power sensors can also be implemented (option R&S® IMS-B7 required).



Spectrum analyzer module

If the optional Spectrum Analyzer Module R&S® IMS-B1 is added, frequencyselective power measurements can be performed. This makes it possible, for example, to take harmonic components of the amplifier into account at the 1 dB compression point. Another application is current monitoring with the BCI method in the automotive range (checking of the first five harmonics).



RF switching unit

The RF switching unit handles the switching of all R&S® IMS RF paths for up to three amplifiers. Two amplifier outputs can be switched to two different transducers (e.g. antennas, current probes) or connection points (e.g. in anechoic chambers and shielded enclosures) by means of the optional Transfer Relay R&S® IMS-B2.  



Internal amplifier module

Conducted measurements can be performed using an internal amplifier module (R&S® IMS model 14), which has a frequency range of 9 kHz to 250 MHz. The minimum amplifier power of 25 W (CW lin) permits measurements with coupling/decoupling networks (CDN) at a test voltage of 10 V in accordance with EN 61000-4-6.  



External amplifiers

Amplifiers with an authorized USB control (e.g. from BONN Elektronik GmbH) can be integrated into the system via plug & play. Up to three amplifiers can be controlled and connected.  



Interlock

The R&S® IMS operating system supports the control of an interlock loop for monitoring security functions during the EMS measurement, e.g. door contacts and amplifier status.  



EUT monitoring

To allow EUT monitoring during the EMC test, the R&S® IMS has four digital inputs. These inputs can be queried either individually or together. To allow EUT stimulation, the R&S® IMS provides four digital outputs (static values or pulse signals). 



IMS operating system


Complete EMC package

The R&S® IMS operating system supports measurements for determining conducted and radiated susceptibility and emission on terminal equipment, modules and integrated circuits. A complete EMS test system is obtained by adding just a few extra components. The intuitive graphical user interface makes learning and operating the system easy.  The measurement philosophy is designed for compliance and batch tests with high EUT throughput as well as for interactive tests supporting development. Applications range from development and conformance tests to production and quality assurance.  



Electromagnetic susceptibility – EMS

The factory-ready test sequences can be adapted to lab instruments either interactively or via the con. guration wizard. The online help provides step-by-step instructions for all tasks from configuring the setup to performing measurements.  During susceptibility tests, integrated control mechanisms limit the susceptibility level to protect both the EUT and the test system from being overloaded.  



EMS measurement features for automotive applications

The following list contains various measurement functions for generating interference that are implemented specifically for the automotive industry:



The test specifications for conducted susceptibility (BCI) call for the measurement of amplifier harmonics and the limiting of the current susceptibility level. To make this possible, the R&S® IMS operating system offers a function for monitoring harmonics via a spectrum analyzer or test receiver. This function can also be used to check an amplifier 
Parallel measurement of the forward and reflected power and the susceptibility level helps boost measurement speed and EUT throughput  
To ensure the reproducibility of test results, the R&S® IMS operating system supports the TEM cell attenuation measurement required in ISO 11452-3  
User-defined equations make it possible to calculate additional single quantities from the current measured values, for example the system impedance of a BCI test setup 




EUT monitoring and stimulation

In addition to generating interference, the EMS measurement software is responsible for monitoring, where the two main tasks are stimulation and monitoring of the EUT.  The following integrated stimulus functions make it possible to control the EUT at defined points in the test sequence: 



Changing the EUT to a defined state (e.g. switching it on or off) when a measurement is started or stopped  
Triggering an action of the EUT at specific frequencies or at each test frequency and using the monitoring functions to check the EUT's response to the effects of the interference  
Resetting the EUT to a defined state after a faulty EUT response has been detected 



The monitoring functions of the R&S® IMS operating system permit fully automatic monitoring of the EUT. The objective is to obtain a GO or NOGO (PASS / FAIL) result for the test frequency and the test level. Monitoring channels can be defined for this purpose. A GO / NOGO decision is reached by using a definable threshold or a decision window. The measured values are displayed in a result table or in a graph. In addition, a separate table is generated that contains only the NOGO frequencies.  
Physical quantities (voltage, current, frequency, temperature) can be monitored either acoustically (sound level) or visually (camera). In the case of tests in the automotive range, vehicular bus systems (CAN, LIN, MOST, FlexRay) can also be monitored.  



Monitoring with measuring instruments

If communication is via physical quantities, measuring instruments (oscilloscope, TTL converter or voltmeter) are used to monitor the EUT's output signals or inject a defined signal at its inputs. USB, RS-232-C, TTL inputs and outputs and software interfaces are possible.  



Automatic determination of immunity thresholds

It is important – particularly in development – to determine maximum susceptibility versus frequency. This fully automatic susceptibility measurement yields two susceptibility level characteristics (hysteresis) that show the susceptibility level at which the faulty EUT response disappears and then reappears. The extensive monitoring capabilities of the R&S IMS operating system allow this measurement task to be automated.  



Functional expansions

The option concept of the IMS OS allows functional expansions for specific customer requirements. By using the options of the R&S EMC32-S EMC measurement software, it is possible to perform measurements in reverberation chambers or measurements in line with mobile radio standards, for example. Automatic EMS test sequences are an important expansion option and allow further automation and thus a more efficient use of the test chambers. An automatically controlled EUT test can be performed using several parameters (loops) (sequential test, e.g. several types of modulation, several turntable positions or several polarizations).

A Scenic Marathon Route
Carmina Stremlau

In my previous blog, City Girl at Heart, I described the way in which San Francisco has shaped my life and instilled in me a love for the unique places and atmosphere that one finds in the hills and valleys along the Bay.  The sights and sounds of San Francisco, combined with the natural warmth and diversity of its people, leave a lasting impression on those who arrive for a brief visit as tourists, or the lucky ones who call this place 'home,' as I once did.  Whether by cable car or on foot, in an Uber or by bike in the green lane, an adventure around the City is typically an enriching, spontaneous experience.  Some of my most memorable (and oftentimes demanding) moments in San Francisco came during the annual marathon, a race that gives meaning to the term 'hill repeat' which describes the training required to make it, with a respectable time, to the finish line.  more
