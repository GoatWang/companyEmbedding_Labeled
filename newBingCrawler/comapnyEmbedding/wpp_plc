History[edit]
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake of just under 30% at a cost of $676,000.[5][6] Sorrell had been the financial director for the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi from 1977 to 1985, managing its takeovers of companies in the US and the UK. The holding company was renamed WPP Group and in 1987 Sorrell became its chief executive.[5]
During 1986 WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.[7]
In 1987 the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m.[5] The company listed on NASDAQ in 1988.[5] In 1989 it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m[5] and in 1998 formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.[5]
In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based advertising company Young & Rubicam for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector.[8] The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.[8] In 2006, WPP took over majority share of China's largest field marketing and brand activation agency, Always Marketing. Always has since been placed under the J. Walter Thompson group to provide breakthrough into the Chinese market and full on field marketing and brand activation support to JWT offices around Asia. In 2007, WPP Digital was created to develop the Group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion.[9][10]
During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.[11][12]
In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million.[13][14] In March 2014 WPP agreed to acquire a minority stake in Swedish broadcaster FlowNetwork. [15] In July 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in the digital healthcare agency ABS Creative.[16] Then in November 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. [17]
Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was hit hard by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. It was suggested that poor patch management and user access administration following IT staffing cuts may have contributed to the scale of the infection affecting WPP.[18]
Operations[edit]
WPP's advertising agency company holdings include the Grey Group, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam Brands, Landor Associates, and JWT (formerly known as J. Walter Thompson Co.).[19]
WPP's government lobbying and public relations company holdings including Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, and Cohn & Wolfe (the last two being part of Young & Rubicam Brands).[20]
WPP's media investment management company holdings are operated by GroupM and include Mindshare, MEC (formerly Mediaedge:cia), Maxus, MediaCom (originally part of Grey Group) and Essence.[21]
WPP's research insight and consulting companies, forming a separate umbrella group known as Kantar, comprise BMRB, Added Value, Kantar Video, Indian Market Research Bureau, Millward Brown, Management Ventures Inc., Research International (which no longer exist as an entity after the merger with TNS) and TNS.[22]
Delfinware Domestic Wireware, which was established in 1969 and manufactures kitchen and bathroom wire racks, is also a subsidiary of WPP Group.[23]
Controversies[edit]
2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration[edit]
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended £12.93m pay packet drew increasing public attention.[24][25] The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.[25][26]
Taxation[edit]
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper "might expect" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.[27]
Television Audience Measurement[edit]
In 2012 the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. NDTV's lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeking $1.4 billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty, cited a public conversation between Vikram Chandra, CEO of NDTV, and Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, in which Chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery; his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful.[28][29][30][31][32]
WPP responded that the lawsuit had not been served on WPP or any of its operating companies, the New York court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal, seeking legal costs, and that it was considering a lawsuit against NDTV for defamation, a threat which NDTV in turn called "baseless".[33] The motion to dismiss was filed a week later, with the statement in its memorandum of law that "This case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff, a television station in New Delhi, India, to drum up media coverage in India to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years ... New Delhi TV has crossed the globe and come to New York State Supreme Court to complain about an Indian company, TAM, and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in India."[34] The motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on 14 December 2012.[35] Nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal, writing that "NDTV attempts to transform a potential contract claim against TAM into tort and oral contract claims against the Nielsen defendants. Nothing in the law supports such a magic trick. Simply put, NDTV fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action."[36]

                Dove owner’s cost-cutting will lead to creation of fewer ads
            



                WPP falls as much as 4.4 percent, biggest decline in a month
            













Unilever CEO Turns to Overhaul to Protect Independence




WPP Plc fell the most in a month after one of the advertising company’s biggest clients, consumer-product giant Unilever, said it would cut back on its marketing spending, fueling concerns about a broader ad-industry slowdown.Unilever, which sells Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, will produce 30 percent fewer ads as part of a cost-cutting drive, Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said Thursday in a phone interview. WPP, whose Ogilvy & Mather agency makes ads for Dove, dropped as much as 4.4 percent, the most since March 3.

The blow came as WPP, the world’s largest advertising company, was already contending with a slow start to 2017 and a weaker-than-expected growth forecast. Auto sales are sagging and consumer-products companies, in response to slowing growth, are looking for ways to save money on advertising and simplify their commitments. Business with Unilever contributes about 3 percent of WPP’s revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.




“Big advertisers are cutting their marketing spend,” said Claire Barbaret, an analyst at Invest Securities in Paris. “All of them are trying to cut their costs because we’re in a world where there’s not much growth.”London-based WPP declined 1.8 percent to 1,707 pence at 11:59 a.m. in London, after dipping as low as 1,662 pence. French rival Publicis Groupe SA, which in February reported disappointing 2016 results, fell less than 1 percent to 64.34 euros in Paris. In December, WPP’s GroupM forecast a 4.4 percent increase in global advertising to $547 billion this year.Unilever didn’t give details on its spending plans. The company, which is also selling off its spreads business, aims to reduce the number of creative agencies it employs by about half, Pitkethly said on a call with investors -- a move which could benefit large agency owners like WPP. Unilever said it will reduce the number of consultants it employs by around 40 percent.The moves by Unilever mirror those of Procter & Gamble Co., the world’s biggest advertiser, which said on Wednesday that it’s halved the number of agencies it works with globally.“We fed the agency beast by hiring thousands of them,” P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said at an American Association of Advertising Agencies conference in Los Angeles.Auto Sales




This week Ford Motor Co., another large WPP client, reported a 7.2 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for March, as General Motors Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Toyota Motor Corp. missed estimates.Unilever, which is seeking to safeguard its independence after fighting off a takeover bid from Kraft Heinz Co. earlier this year, also said Thursday that it plans to sell its margarine spreads business, which includes Flora, Stork, Country Crock and other slow-growing brands.Advertisers’ decisions filter down to ad firms like WPP, Publicis and Interpublic Group of Cos. through the range of services they offer -- not just creating the marketing campaigns but also developing the media strategies and buying up advertising space across formats like television, newspapers and magazines, and the web.WPP’s relationship with Unilever became strained in February when public relations agency Finsbury, majority-owned by WPP, was hired by Kraft to handle its U.K. strategic communications for the $143 billion takeover bid -- effectively pitting WPP against one of its biggest clients.The conflict quickly ended after Unilever CEO Paul Polman complained and WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell ordered Finsbury to drop the Kraft mandate, people familiar with the matter said at the time.WPP had no immediate comment on the Unilever moves.— With assistance by William Canny

Media Company Research Reports


Companies in the Media (or ‘mass media’) industry are involved in multiple activities in the areas such as broadcast media (radio and TV), publishing (printing), recordings (audio cassettes, CDs, DVDs, etc.), movies, digital media (the Net and cellular phones), and others, aimed at reaching the majority of mass audience.
The Media world witnessed formidable growth throughout the former ten years thanks to the technology breakthroughs in the broadcasting and printing sectors, evoked by the elevated significance of modifying media usage patterns. By end-2017, the market is anticipated to crawl to a world value of nearly EUR 958 billion. North America, steered by the U.S., is the globe’s largest, though a slow-growing, marketplace. The global media space is chaired by such giants as Comcast Corporation, Time Warner, News Corporation, Google, and Walt Disney. 
This Catalogue embeds the research reports casting light on the opportunities and hardships facing Media Companies worldwide. The research reports discuss the companies’ geographical footprints; provide their competitive benchmarking, financial statements, SWOT analyses, products’ positioning, marketing tactics, and corporate strategies. Highlights of Media Companies’ income levels, ad spending, as well as of governmental incentives are featured in the research reports too.

                        What has always defined Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide is its ability to build brands.The difference is that building brands today requires a keen understanding of how new communications technology, new channels, and vibrant creativity combine. This is a world where the consumer is now in control, and consumer insight is paramount, and so the quality and diversity of our people are vital. A contemporary outlook and true cultural attunement are much more important in a world where there is a new mandate for our business. That mandate is integrated communications and our response, what we call 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® , means a willingness to use the broadest array of tools and techniques to understand, develop and enhance the relationship between a consumer and a brand.We do this on both a local and a global scale. Local 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® keeps the agency fully rooted in the marketplace, attracting top local clients and the best people to work on them. This keeps our understanding of the local consumer and marketplace intimate.Global 360 Degree Brand Stewardship® is a marriage of local know-how with a worldwide network capable of articulating brands as they cross borders - vital to the growing number of multinational clients seeking to leverage their powerful brands in new markets around the world.

WPP Digital acquires Deeplocal in the US

RNS Number : 4647D WPP PLC 27 April 2017  





FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


27 APRIL 2017




 
 
WPP PLC ("WPP")
 
 
WPP Digital acquires innovation studio Deeplocal in the US 
 
 
WPP Digital, the digital investment arm of WPP, announces that it has acquired Deeplocal, Inc., ("Deeplocal") an innovation studio focused on product invention, design, and engineering for clients' marketing campaigns in the US.
 
Deeplocal's gross revenues were approximately US$12 million for the period ended December 31, 2016. Clients include Google, Netflix, Airbnb, Inc., Lyft and American Eagle Outfitters. Deeplocal is based in Pittsburgh and was founded in 2006 as a spin-off of Carnegie Mellon University.  
 
Deeplocal employs over 50 people with diverse skill sets including robotics, hardware development, electrical engineering, software development, industrial design, strategy, and creative. The studio solves business challenges for clients with strategy-led creative inventions and marketing campaigns and the rapidly designs, engineers, and builds working prototypes and products. This work is all done in-house.
The acquisition continues WPP's strategy of focusing on three key areas that differentiate the Group's offering to clients: technology, data and content. WPP's digital assets include companies such as Acceleration (marketing technology consultancy), Cognifide (content management technology), Conexance (data cooperative), Salmon (e-commerce), and Hogarth (digital production technology). WPP also has investments in a number of innovative technology services companies such as Globant and Mutual Mobile, as well as ad technology companies such as AppNexus, comScore (data investment management), Domo, mySupermarket, Percolate and ScrollMotion.
The Group has invested in digital content companies like Russell Simmons' All Def Digital, Fullscreen, Indigenous Media, Imagina (a content rights and media company based in Spain), MRC, Mitú, Refinery29, VICE and Woven Digital. WPP's roster of wholly owned digital agencies include AKQA, Blue State Digital, F.biz, Mirum, POSSIBLE, VML and Wunderman. In 2015, the Group acquired a majority stake in Essence, the global digital agency and the largest independent buyer of digital media. In October WPP's wholly-owned operating company Xaxis acquired Triad Retail Media, a leading digital retail media specialist.
WPP's digital revenues were over US$7.5 billion in 2016, representing 39% of the Group's total revenues of US$19.4 billion. WPP has set a target of 40-45% of revenue to be derived from digital in the next four to five years. In North America, WPP companies (including associates) collectively generate revenues of US$7.3 billion and employ almost 28,000 people.

Fast read
A quick, pre-digested, highly-compressed version of the 2014 Annual Report



Who we are





WPP is the world leader in communications services. It comprises leading companies in all these disciplines:

 Advertising
 Media Investment Management
 Data Investment Management
 Public Relations & Public Affairs
 Branding & Identity
 Healthcare Communications
 Direct, Digital, Promotion  & Relationship Marketing
 Specialist Communications

There are more than 155 companies within the Group – and each is a distinctive brand in its own right. Each has its own identity, commands its own loyalty, and is committed to its own specialist expertise. That is their individual strength. Clients seek their talent and their experience on a brand-by-brand basis. Between them, our companies work with 355  of the Fortune Global 500, all 30 of the Dow Jones 30 and 71 of the NASDAQ 100. It is also of increasing value to clients that WPP companies and their people can work together, as increasingly they do: providing a tailor-made range of integrated communications services. Nearly 830 clients are now served in three distinct disciplines. Over 530 clients  are served in four disciplines, and these clients account for over 53% of Group revenues. Group companies also work with nearly 430 clients across six or more countries. 
Collectively, almost 179,000 people (including associates) work for WPP companies,  out of over 3,000 offices in 111 countries.

Why we exist





Our mission
To develop and manage talent;to apply that talent, throughout the world,  for the benefit of clients;  to do so in partnership;  to do so with profit.
Within WPP, our clients have access to companies with all the necessary marketing and communications skills; companies with strong and distinctive cultures of their own; famous names, many of them. WPP, the parent company, complements these companies in three distinct ways.

First, it relieves them of much administrative work. Financial matters (such as planning, budgeting, reporting, control, treasury, tax, mergers, acquisitions, investor relations,  legal affairs and internal audit) are co-ordinated centrally.
Second, the parent company encourages and enables operating companies of different disciplines to work together for the benefit of clients. It also plays an across-the-Group  role in the management of talent, property, procurement, IT, knowledge sharing, practice development and sustainability.
And, finally, WPP itself can function as the 21st-century equivalent of the full-service agency. For some clients, predominantly those with a vast geographical spread and a need for a wide range of marketing services, WPP can act as a portal to provide a single point  of contact and accountability.

What we think





In praise of the long view
by Sir Martin Sorrell 
Champions of the long view are becoming harder to find. Boardrooms (in the West at least) are more likely to be inhabited by the ghosts of Lehman than John Maynard Keynes’ animal spirits. Consequently, targets are often reached not by maximising revenues, but by minimising costs – including marketing spend.
Despite the challenges, our business performed well in 2014, which was another record year for the Group. We expect the pattern for 2015 to be much the same: a bit of a slog,  but a satisfactory result at the end of it, ahead of last year. Looking further into the future, corporate minds will eventually turn to investment and growth, and marketing services will be one of the principal beneficiaries.
Throughout our three decades of existence, taking the long view has worked well for WPP and its stakeholders.
We have the right strategy to take advantage of the fundamental shifts – both technological and geographical – shaping our industry. We continue to focus on: new markets, new media, data investment management and the application of technology, and ‘horizontality’.

You May Not Know Where You’re Going Until You’ve Got There 
(Which is why The Best Brief may be The Brand)
by Jeremy Bullmore
In business, particularly in marketing, we seem to be at least as reluctant as scientists to come clean about our processes of thought.

Four strategic priorities





Our goal remains to be the world’s most admired and respected communications services advisor to global, multinational, regional and local companies. To that end, we have four core strategic priorities: 

Increase the combined geographic share of revenues from the faster-growing markets of  Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe to 40-45% of revenues. 
Increase the share of revenues of new media to 40-45% of revenues.  
Maintain the share of more measurable marketing services – such as data investment management and direct, digital and interactive – at 50% of revenues, with a focus  on the application of new technology, big data and digital.  
Advance ‘horizontality’ by ensuring our people work together for the benefit of  clients, primarily through two horizontal integrators: Global Client Leaders and Regional, Sub-Regional and Country Managers.

The value of the Group’s non-controlled investments rose by almost £400 million to £669 million during the year, reflecting the increasing value of our investments in content businesses, primarily VICE, and  the technology partnerships formed during the year with AppNexus and Rentrak.
With a current equity market capitalisation of approximately £20.5 billion, the total enterprise value of your Company is approximately £23.6 billion, a multiple  of 12.4 times 2014 headline EBITDA. 
Free cash flow and net debt
Free cash flow amounted to almost  £1.2 billion in 2014, over £1 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Average net debt was £3.0 billion in 2014, the same level as  in 2013, at 2014 exchange rates, and net debt at 31 December 2014 was £2.3 billion, against £2.2 billion in 2013, reflecting significant incremental net acquisition  spend of £0.3 billion and incremental share re-purchases of £0.3 billion, more than offsetting the improvements in working capital at the year end. Average net debt remained around 1.6 times headline EBITDA in 2014, at the low end of the Group’s target range of 1.5-2.0 times. 
Revenue growth
Our reported revenue growth for the year was 4.6%, and on a constant currency  basis, which excludes the impact of currency movements, revenue was up 11.3%. This difference of 6.7% reflects strong foreign currency headwinds: chiefly due to the strength of the pound sterling against the  US dollar and euro in the first nine months, to some extent offset by the weakness of  the pound sterling against the US dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Indian rupee in the final quarter. 
On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions, revenue was up 8.2%, with net sales up 3.3%. In the fourth quarter, like-for-like revenue was up almost 8%, following like-for-like growth in the third quarter  of well over 7%, due to stronger growth in the fourth quarter in North America, the UK and Western Continental Europe, offset by lower growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and  Central & Eastern Europe. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second half was therefore well over 7% compared with  well over 8% in the first. 
Geographic performance 
North America, with constant currency revenue growth of well over 10% in the final quarter and like-for-like growth of over 9%, maintained the strong growth seen in the first nine months, an improvement over the third quarter year-to-date constant currency growth of almost 10%. 
In the UK, constant currency revenue was up 16%, with like-for-like up almost 13% on a full year basis. Net sales were  up over 7% in constant currency, with like-for-like up almost 5%.
Western Continental Europe revenue grew almost 4% like-for-like (almost 5%  in the second half), compared with 0.5%  in 2013.
In Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa  & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was fastest overall, as it was in quarter three, up 16% in constant currency and up over 6% like-for-like.

Sector performance
Advertising and Media Investment Management was the strongest performing sector, with constant currency revenue up almost 20% for the year and up over 16% like-for-like. Net sales were up almost 8% in constant currencies and up 5% like-for-like. 
Data Investment Management revenue grew by 1.5% in constant currency, with like-for-like revenue up 0.6%, and the second half weaker than the first, partly  due to stronger comparatives in the second half of 2013. More significantly, net sales were stronger, up almost 1% in constant currencies and up 0.6% like-for-like, reflecting an improvement in the custom research parts of the business. 
The Group’s Public Relations & Public Affairs businesses returned to top-line growth in 2014, with full year revenue up well over 2% on both a constant currency and like-for-like basis. 
At the Group’s Branding & Identity, Healthcare and Specialist Communications businesses (including direct, digital and interactive), full-year revenue was up over 9% in constant currency and up 4% like-for-like. In the fourth quarter, constant currency revenue grew strongly at over 11% with like-for-like revenue growth of over 4%, an improvement over the third quarter. Net sales margins for the sector as a whole fell 0.7 margin points to 14.7% and by 0.6 margin points in constant currency, as parts of the Group’s direct, digital and interactive businesses in Western Continental Europe, together with Branding & Identity and Healthcare Communications slowed.
In 2014, 36% of the Group’s revenue  and net sales came from direct, digital and interactive, up over one percentage point from the previous year, with revenue growing well over 11% like-for-like.

Sustainability
Sustainability issues increasingly impact the operations, strategies and communications of leading brands. As these brands – our clients – adapt to social and environmental challenges they look to our companies for the best advice and insight. By developing our sustainability expertise and by improving our own social and environmental performance, we can forge stronger relationships with our clients and generate value for our business and society.
Clients who engaged with us on sustainability were worth at least £1.35 billion to the Group in 2014, equivalent to 12% of revenues, a 7% increase on the previous year.
People
We invested £73.9 million on training and welfare programs in 2014. 
At year-end 2014, women comprised 24% of the WPP Board, 31% of directors and executive leaders of our companies  and 54% of total full-time employees.

Environment
We have cut our carbon footprint per employee to 2.26 tonnes of CO2e, a 33% reduction from 2006.
Our video conferencing network now comprises more than 700 units in over  160 cities.

Social contribution

In 2014, our social investment was worth £21.8 million, equivalent to 1.5% of reported profit before tax.
In addition, WPP media agencies negotiated free media space worth  £25.1 million on behalf of pro bono clients.
