Kingold Jewelry Inc, one of China's leading gold jewellery manufacturers, has been selected as a designer and manufacturer for a new line of 24-karat gold products to be offered by the World Gold Council (WGC). 
The agreement, which runs through 2012, was signed between Kingold and the WGC on May 14. The product line, named "Youth Millennial," targets China’s affluent jewellery consumers.
Kingold was selected after a thorough testing process, and is one of only a few select jewellery designers designated to design and promote the "Youth Millennial" product line. The pricing of these products will be based upon its specific design quality and unique attributes. 
Traditionally, jewellery sold in China has been largely tied to the weight of the product. The WGC will serve as the primary marketers and promoters of the product line and intends to host certain retail fairs and trade conferences and focus initially on the three major markets of Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Kingold will design, manufacture, and deliver the products to the WGC's designated retailers and also will help to promote the product line.
"We are delighted to continue our close working relationship with the WGC. This new sales model will use the piecework selling model instead of the by-weight model. We expect that these pieces will be received favourably by China's upper and rising middle classes, which have trended towards paying a premium for high-quality, branded products,” said Zhihong Jia, chairman and CEO of Kingold. “We feel that selection by the WGC is a testament to Kingold's quality and reputation within its industry, and that this agreement could help to both improve our sales during 2012 and also open the possibility of additional collaboration in the future."

2016 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL REVIEW
Net Sales Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $390.5 million, an increase of $126.7 million, or 48.1%, from net sales of $263.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net sales increased primarily as a result of increase in total sales volume in amount of $84.7 million, the increase in the average unit selling price for branded production in amount of $63.2 million, offset by approximately $17.1 million of foreign currency translation loss.
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,063 million, an increase of $343.6 million, or 47.8%, from net sales of $719.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by increase in total sales volume in amount of $308.9 million, the increase in the average unit selling price for branded production in amount of $91.5 million, partially offset the decreased sales in customized production, and offset by approximately a $45.9 million foreign currency translation loss.
Gross Profit  Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $50.4 million, an increase of $34.9 million from $15.6 million for the same period in 2015. 
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $125.0 million, an increase of $96.2 million from $28.8 million for the same period in 2015.
Gross Margin Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 12.9%, compared to 5.9% for the same period in 2015. The substantial increase in gross margin was because: 1) the unit price of branded production sales increased from RMB 206.7 per gram for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 257.1 per gram in the same period of 2016; 2) the percentage increase of the unit price is smaller than the increase in the sales as the unit cost of branded production increased from RMB 197.2 per gram for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 227.6 per gram in the same period in 2016; 3) the Company purchased a significant quantity of gold in prior periods at relatively low prices, making the production costs for three months ended September 30, 2016 much lower than normal.
Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 11.8%, compared to 4.0% for the same period in 2015. The substantial increase in gross margin was because: 1) the unit price of branded production sales increased from RMB 212.5 per gram for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 240.3 per gram in the same period of 2016; 2) the percentage increase of the unit price is smaller than the increase in the sales as the unit cost of branded production increased from RMB 209.2 per gram for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 215.3 per gram in the same period in 2016; 3) the Company purchased a significant quantity of gold in prior periods at relatively low prices, making the production costs for nine months ended September 30, 2016 much lower than normal.
Net Income For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income increased 79.3% to $15.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, based on 66.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2015, or $0.13 per diluted share, based on 66.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the prior-year period.
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 218.9% to $50.7 million, or $0.76 per diluted share based on 66.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $15.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, based on 66.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the same period of 2015.

Net cash used in operating activities was $726.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $34.0 million for the same period in 2015. The significant increase in net cash used in operating was mainly due to purchase of inventory of $817.8 million in anticipation of the increased production and sales demand when the Jewelry Park is completed which may stimulate Kingold's sales starting from the second half 2016. In addition, in connection with the Company's significant bank borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was required to pledge significant of gold with the banks as collateral, which also led the Company to increase the inventory purchases and stockpile. On the other hand, in connection with the Jewelry Park Transfer Contract, the Company received net proceeds of $151.4 million cash payment from Wuhan Lianfuda for the Jewelry Park transfer, such amount will be adjusted when the Company delivers the Jewelry Park to Wuhan Lianfuda in the near future. The overall increase in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflected in the above mentioned factors.  
Kingold's net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in inventories (principally gold).  Other factors that may vary significantly include the Company's purchases of gold and income taxes.  The Company expects that the net cash it generates from operating activities will continue to fluctuate as the Company's inventories, receivables, accounts payables, and other factors described above change with increased production and purchase of larger quantities of raw materials (principally gold).
OUTLOOK FOR 2016Based on 2016 first nine months results, its existing resources and capacity (which includes the Company's recent proceeds from its previously announced financing and gold lease agreements) along with strong demand for 24-karat gold products in China, the Company raised its guidance for gold processed during 2016 from between 50 metric tons and 60 metric tons to between 60 metric tons and 65 metric tons.

WUHAN CITY, China, April 7, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Kingold Jewelry, Inc  (NASDAQ: KGJI), one of China's leading manufacturers and designers of 24-karat  gold jewelry and ornaments, today announced that it has entered into an  agreement with Bank of Communications Co., Ltd. to design and manufacture  24-karat gold investment-oriented products for resale by the Bank to customers  in its retail banking network throughout Hubei Province, China. The deal will  serve as a pilot project which Kingold ultimately hopes will extend to the  Bank's other locations throughout China.
Under the agreement, Kingold will design and manufacture 24-karat gold  investment-oriented products, including coins, bars and ornaments, on behalf of  the Bank. Kingold's contract with the Bank extends for one year, and is  renewable at end of that term. While Kingold expects to hire additional labor to  assist in the production of 24-karat gold products for the Bank, Kingold does  not anticipate that it will incur incremental capital expenditures for either  manufacturing equipment or for facilities in connection with this agreement.  Kingold expects this relationship to begin contributing meaningfully to its  overall revenue in the second half of 2011.
The agreement with the Bank further advances Kingold's strategy to build a  new line of complimentary 24-karat gold investment-oriented products.  It is  expected that the new product line, which caters to the affinity of Chinese  consumers for gold as a store of wealth will, on average, generate higher gross  margin than that of its traditional gold jewelry and ornament lines.
"We are very pleased to announce this new relationship with Bank of  Communications Co., Ltd. on the heels of our recent agreement with China  Merchants Bank," said Mr. Zhihong Jia, Chairman and CEO of Kingold. "The Bank  has a strong presence in Hubei, one of China's largest provinces with a  population of roughly 60 million. We intend to provide the finest quality  24-karat gold products to customers located throughout the Bank's network of 79  retail branches across Hubei Province.  We will continue to pursue similar  arrangements with other world class financial institutions in China, aiming to  grow Kingold's revenues and enhance overall profitability."
