Why Rocket Fuel?
You can get to the future faster by using predictive marketing to anticipate consumer wants and needs. Rocket Fuel’s Predictive Marketing Platform, built on a foundation of AI, will enable you to:

Delight more people in more places: add predictive capabilities to your media across brand and direct response advertising
Transform complexity into performance: Rocket Fuel only gets better when faced with complex consumer journeys and large volumes of high-velocity data
Achieve real results: centralize and activate data from digital and real-life signals to create consumer experiences that drive business growth







How is Predictive Marketing Different?
Predictive marketing gives you the power to deliver personalized, always-on, always-relevant experience to the consumer. When you predict and create these magic moments, you’ll be rewarded with higher levels of engagement and higher ROI.

Talk to real people instead of devices
Predictive organizations are customer-centric, not product- or device-centric. All transactions and devices tie back to a single identity by person or household.





Upgrade from static segments to modeled moments
Traditional marketing segments are rooted in historical data. Predictive businesses build models that include transactional moments for real-time accuracy and the power to anticipate and exceed customer expectations.





Use owned data for competitive differentiation
More and more, predictive brands use their first-party data to drive better marketing outcomes. They're doing this by unlocking latent insights from this proprietary data, and using these insights to increase innovation and improve decision making.





Enable brand moments throughout the consumer journey
Consumer journeys are becoming extremely complex, and predictive brands anticipate brand moments so they can be there when consumers want and need them most.





Evolve from data to decisions
Data management platforms must evolve into decision management platforms, with syndicated intelligence replacing syndicated data, thereby enabling one system's AI to talk to another system's AI.

Why Rocket Fuel?













A huge market opportunity.
Rocket Fuel’s Artificial Intelligence and Big Data systems help marketing clients leverage unimaginable amounts of data in real time to increase the ROI of their marketing dollars. We’re players in a $15billion market with no company owning more than 3%.






An engineering infrastructure that blows away the competition.
Our Artificial Intelligence completes over 36,000,000,000 decisions per second. We process 77,000,000,000 bid requests per day. Our Big Data is over 68 petabytes (1 petabyte = 1 quadrillion bytes). We have 465 Terabytes of RAM – 18x the RAM of the IBM computer Watson. We have 25 PHDs on staff leading our AI programs.






A dream-team of Executive Leaders.
Executives come from some of the most innovative, successful companies in the world including Oracle, Walmart, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, IBM, Blue Martini, and Electronic Arts. Our founders remain active in driving our business and rolling up their sleeves alongside our employees and our Board of Director’s reads like a “Who’s Who in Silicon Valley.”






A company consistently considered a “Best Place to Work.”
We’ve been recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work”  in New York, the Bay Area, and Chicago. We have lunches, snacks, happy hours, ergonomic desks, lounges, an awesome game room, and more. …and Flexible Time Off (and more!).






An exciting and rewarding future.
We’re already leading the market with our DSP offering and are continuing to strengthen our lead. We have also partnered with half of the major trading desks, and focused on bringing more partnerships to help agencies gain an edge on their competition. New clients are added daily – effectively building an additional revenue stream while increasing our traditional base.
