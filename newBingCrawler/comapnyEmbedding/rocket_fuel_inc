Edit ArticlewikiHow to Make Rocket Fuel
Hobbyists launch scaled down models of real rockets. This simulates the experience of witnessing an actual full size rocket launch. Model rockets require fuel to be launched into the air. Fuel and fuel cartridges can be purchased at many hobby stores, but you also can make your own rocket fuel. Use these tips to learn how to make rocket fuel.








Steps






1

Preheat an oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).








2

Mix the ingredients. Combine 100 g (3.22 oz.) of potassium nitrate (KN03), 50 g (1.61 oz.) of sugar, 18 g (0.58 oz.) of karo syrup and 80mL (5 tbs. or 1/3 cup) of distilled water in a saucepan.








3

Place the saucepan on a medium-high burner flame.







4

Stir to combine the ingredients. The mixture will turn clear when the cooking process is complete, which should take about 5 minutes. Wear protective gloves while cooking and handling the ingredients.








5

Pour the mixture into two pie pans. Divide the mixture equally between the two pans. Form a pool of liquid in each pan, and avoid coating the inner sides of the pie pans.








6

Put the pie pans into the preheated oven. Wear gloves to protect your hands.








7

Bake the rocket fuel for 45 minutes.







8

Remove the pie pans from the oven. Allow the rocket fuel to cool to approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) so it can be safely handled.








9

Remove the rocket fuel from the pans. Use a wooden stirrer or spoon to remove the fuel from the pans.








10

Knead the finished product together while it is still warm. Be sure to wear gloves. The rocket fuel may not readily stick together, so you may need to apply strong pressure to it.








11

Form the rocket fuel into balls or cakes. While the fuel is still warm, use your gloved hands to form shapes that will allow you to fit it into plastic containers.








12

Place the rocket fuel into airtight plastic storage containers. Seal the containers.

I am in the process of creating a rocket.  Can anyone confirm that the recipe mentioned in the article works?

The rocket fuel works.  Just make a fuse, and it really burns.

Thanks!

How dangerous is this rocket fuel?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

It is very dangerous if not handled properly. Don't light it inside, and if it is in a rocket then point it skyward, light the fuse and get behind something.

Can I switch out the potassium nitrate for another material?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

No. KNO3 is your primary oxidizer and the most readily available one too.  Look up "stump remover" in a horticultural store.  Be sure it says that it contains 100% KNO3.


Thanks!

Tips


Storage containers should be airtight. The rocket fuel will quickly become unusable if exposed to humidity.
The rocket fuel cannot be reshaped. It's a good idea to pour directly into the casing immediately. If reheated the rocket fuel will likely ignite, and burn your house down and it'll be all your fault. If you want you can make a set diameter for cakes and stack them in a tube to make a rocket engine.
Potassium nitrate is widely used as stump remover, but it can be obtained from a pyrotechnical chemical supplier or at a hardware store.
Make sure no air bubbles form in the finished product. Doing so will create a bomb ready to go off.





Warnings


Watch closely while the mixture is cooking so that it does not boil over or overflow.
Some flakes of the finished product may fall while the fuel is being removed from the pie pans or formed into shapes. These flakes are flammable. Gather up the flakes and knead them back into the finished product. Do not throw them into the trash as they are combustible.
No one should interfere with the rocket fuel making process. Witnesses should stay clear and pets should not be allowed in the area.
The finished rocket fuel is unlikely to ignite due to shock or friction, but will readily ignite when exposed to open flame.
There should be no open flames anywhere near the mixture at any time during the process, except for the burner used to heat the saucepan.
Hot ingredients may splash during the cooking process and the transfer from the saucepan to pie pans. Avoid contact with exposed skin.
Never reheat the finished product.

Why Rocket Fuel?
You can get to the future faster by using predictive marketing to anticipate consumer wants and needs. Rocket Fuel’s Predictive Marketing Platform, built on a foundation of AI, will enable you to:

Delight more people in more places: add predictive capabilities to your media across brand and direct response advertising
Transform complexity into performance: Rocket Fuel only gets better when faced with complex consumer journeys and large volumes of high-velocity data
Achieve real results: centralize and activate data from digital and real-life signals to create consumer experiences that drive business growth







How is Predictive Marketing Different?
Predictive marketing gives you the power to deliver personalized, always-on, always-relevant experience to the consumer. When you predict and create these magic moments, you’ll be rewarded with higher levels of engagement and higher ROI.

Talk to real people instead of devices
Predictive organizations are customer-centric, not product- or device-centric. All transactions and devices tie back to a single identity by person or household.





Upgrade from static segments to modeled moments
Traditional marketing segments are rooted in historical data. Predictive businesses build models that include transactional moments for real-time accuracy and the power to anticipate and exceed customer expectations.





Use owned data for competitive differentiation
More and more, predictive brands use their first-party data to drive better marketing outcomes. They're doing this by unlocking latent insights from this proprietary data, and using these insights to increase innovation and improve decision making.





Enable brand moments throughout the consumer journey
Consumer journeys are becoming extremely complex, and predictive brands anticipate brand moments so they can be there when consumers want and need them most.





Evolve from data to decisions
Data management platforms must evolve into decision management platforms, with syndicated intelligence replacing syndicated data, thereby enabling one system's AI to talk to another system's AI.
