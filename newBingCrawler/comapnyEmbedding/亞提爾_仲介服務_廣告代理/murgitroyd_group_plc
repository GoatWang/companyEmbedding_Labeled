Innovation Journey
Innovation isn’t only about new ideas. It’s about an overall, ongoing approach that keeps your business – and your IP – ahead of the competition. Working in partnership with you, we’ll identify and act on every opportunity to create meaningful, valuable IP, as well as responding to further opportunities as they arise. The process is continuous, and we’ll take you through it, stage by stage.

That means looking at existing products as well as new ideas to obtain all the protection you need.  We’ll pair you with a specialist IP attorney with extensive experience in your field.

Freedom-to-operate searching
Patentability searching
Brand ideation
Product ideation
Invention spotting

We work with you right from the ideas stage. So we understand how you operate and what you want to achieve. Which helps us identify and protect everything that’s of value to your company. Our attorneys are diligent, creative and imaginative. Their highly-developed skills are augmented by the kind of lateral thinking that safeguards your rights at every turn.
We’ll help with worldwide IP drafting and filing in the areas of:

Patents
Trade marks
Designs
Utility models

We’ll also advise you on:

Copyright

Trade secrets
Database rights

Secure
Proper protection for your IP 
Like every other aspect of your business, your IP has to be properly protected. We’re here to make sure that happens. We’ll start by obtaining the best protection. Then we’ll help you uphold your rights.
With direct representation rights in 15 countries throughout Europe and a vetted global partner network for all other territories, we’re in the strongest possible position to represent you.
We’ll help with:

Prosecution
Opposition and appeal representation
European patent validation
Infringement and validity support
Anti-counterfeiting support

Managing your assets
IP is only valuable if it helps your business succeed. We work with you to put the right protection in place, and review this regularly to make sure it continues to benefit you. So you know your most valuable assets are protected, and you’re always investing in the right areas of your business. That helps leverage the maximum possible value, while cutting unnecessary costs.
If you prefer to manage your own portfolio, our client portal has all the tools and guidance you need. And we’re still there if you want us for advice, answers or reports.

Acquisition and Trading Update

RNS Number : 1329C Murgitroyd Group PLC 24 June 2016  

24 June 2016
 
Murgitroyd Group PLC 
Acquisition and trading update
 
Acquisition
 
The Board of Murgitroyd Group PLC ("the Group") announces that its principal operating subsidiary, Murgitroyd & Company Limited ("Murgitroyd"), yesterday, completed the acquisition of certain trade and assets from Dallas-based MDB Capital Group, LLC ("MDB") and Managua-registered Patentvest S.A. ("Patentvest"), including employee and client contracts of MDB's IP Software & Services Group.
 
The consideration of $2.43m, paid at completion, included the value of the tangible assets, IT systems and records, and will be part-funded through a new term loan facility with the balance funded from existing Group resources.  The transaction is anticipated to be broadly earnings neutral in its first year.  In the twelve months to 31 May 2016, MDB's IP Software & Services Group generated gross revenues of approximately $860,000.
 
US Patent Attorneys, Michael Chernoff and John Wootress, based in the USA and Nicaragua respectively, along with eighteen staff, including sixteen Managua-based Patent engineers predominantly engaged in US Patent searching, have transferred to Murgitroyd.
 
Commenting on the acquisition, Chairman of the Group, Ian Murgitroyd, said: "This acquisition reflects our strategy of offering a comprehensive suite of IP advisory and support services to global companies and international law firms in the Group's largest geographical market, the USA, with the objective of increasing Murgitroyd's market share of high value European Patent Attorney services purchased by them."
 
Mr Chernoff, MDB's Chief Intellectual Property Officer, who joins Murgitroyd as Director, IP Strategy and Portfolio Management, was previously Director of Legal Services, Patent Operations at Accenture, and also has experience as a Patent Examiner at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Mr Wootress, Director of Intellectual Property at MDB, joins Murgitroyd as Director, IP Research and Analysis.  Prior to joining MDB, he was Deputy General Counsel for Belkin International, Inc.
 
Commenting on the opportunities arising from the transaction, Group Deputy Chairman, and Murgitroyd CEO, Edward Murgitroyd, said: "I am delighted that Murgitroyd is extending its IP support services offering through the expansion of its IP strategy and Patent searching capabilities with the addition of Michael and John, and their team, and I believe this will augment existing sales channels used to win significant, higher-margin, European Patent Attorney work."
 
Trading update
 
The Group also today announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31 May 2016.  
 
Consistent with its Interim Results announced in February, the Group has continued to see revenue growth in the second half of the financial year.  The Board therefore expects to report revenue in excess of £42m for the financial year ended 31 May 2016, and profit before taxation broadly in line with market expectations.
 
Notwithstanding the acquisition announced above it is also expected that again an increased final dividend will be recommended. 
 
Chairman
 
The announcement of preliminary annual results in September 2015 included a statement to the effect that Group Chairman Ian Murgitroyd intended to move from Executive to non-Executive Chairman.  The Board now confirms that this transition will take place with effect from the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, in October 2016.
