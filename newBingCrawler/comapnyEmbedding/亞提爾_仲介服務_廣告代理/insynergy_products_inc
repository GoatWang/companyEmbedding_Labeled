All shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus are being 
registered for the account of the selling stockholders. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares.


There is significant competition in the Direct Response industry from both 
small and large companies since there are really no barriers to entry.  As 
a result, there are literally hundreds of direct response companies that 
operate in the US and off a wide variety of products across all categories 
of consumer goods. 

The Company will have to rely on the skills of its management to pick 
products which produce successful direct response marketing campaigns 
and ultimately profits to the Company.


Company Description
The Company is a development stage company that is in the process of 
implementing its business plan, but has had no revenues to date.  We are 
not a blank check Company and have no plans or intention to engage in a 
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company, companies, entity or 
person,


 nor do we nor any of our affiliates intend for the Company, once 
it is publicly traded, to be used as a vehicle for some other private 
company to become a publicly traded company. 

Insynergy Products, Inc. (formerly Insynergy, Inc.) (the "Company") was 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010 to engage in Direct 
Response retail marketing and sale of  consumer products through Television 
and the Internet, followed up for successful products with more traditional 
distribution and sale of such products through traditional retail outlets, 
once a brand for the product has been established. 

Our current headquarters are located at 4705 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Suite 205, 
Studio City, CA 91607. Our website is located at www.insynergyproducts.com. 
Our telephone number is (818)760-1644.
