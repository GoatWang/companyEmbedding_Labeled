We free marketers to think, not do

Data science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine-learning is revolutionising marketing. We’re entering the age of the machines, but this shouldn’t be something we fear. We bring you the data-driven marketing products marketers need to take back control.
Curious? 












Why we exist

Today’s world is complex. Marketers are constantly battling with hundreds of competitors, millions of customers, trillions of data points and a proliferation of marketing channels. Despite this, we only ever have finite budgets and just 24 hours in the day.
About Us
