History[edit]
iSIGN was founded in 2006 by Alex Romanov, who has served as president, chief executive officer and director for the company. iSIGN began as a digital signage company offering location-based proximity marketing from signs to handheld mobile devices. It went public in 2009 on the TSX Venture Exchange, then began trading on OTCQX under the symbol “ISDSF” in June 2012. Following an agreement with Mac’s Convenience Stores,[4] iSIGN reportedly became the world's largest interactive digital signage network with 6,000 digital signs in over 1,400 locations.[5] ISIGN reports identifying 1.5 million mobile devices per day.[6]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2013, the company's chief executive officer was Alex Romanov.[2]
Business Model[edit]
The company is acting to shift "traditional advertising to mobile" through "engaging an actionable audience and delivering measurement of that action".[3]
Technology[edit]
iSIGN’s Interactive Media Solutions (IMS) mobile messaging product consists of a proprietary IMS 2.0 platform as well as an IMS 3.1 version featuring dual porting for Linux or Windows, multi-lingual capabilities and 128-bit encryption software for security.[7]
The Smart Antenna, rolled out in 2012, uses the same Bluetooth technology as the IMS but also has WiFi capabilities to connect with iPhone users, broadening mobile messaging capabilities. Smart Antennas have a 300-foot (100m) Bluetooth message broadcasting and WiFi accessible content transmission radius. iSIGN’s patent-pending platform collects and organizes metrics and delivers customizable analytics[8] to merchants while protecting consumer privacy.[9][10]
iSIGN launched a Smart Player in August 2013, the first product of its kind that combines digital signage with mobile messaging capabilities via wireless connectivity. The Smart Player is designed to distribute marketing messages to mobile and stationary devices within range of its location.[11][12]
Customers and Partners[edit]
Canada[edit]
iSIGN Media customers include Mac's Convenience Stores and Couche-Tard outlets (from 2012),[2] and the BC Sports Hall of Fame in Vancouver, British Columbia.
United States[edit]
Smart Antennas have been installed in several Florida cities, including Safety Harbor, Dunedin,[13] Orlando and Clearwater. In 2012, Smart Antennas were installed in the New Orleans tourist attraction Mardi Gras World.[1]
Partnerships and Licensees[edit]
Partners include: AOpen America Inc., TELUS, Keyser, and IBM, with solution distribution by BlueStar Inc. iSIGN holds licensing and distribution agreements with GraphicMedia.

The Company will be presenting its new technology at the Customer Engagement Technology World (CETW) in New York on November 9-10, 2011.The Marriage of Digital and Mobile - Creating Customer EngagementWith multiple channels and platforms, new technologies are changing the way that businesses are engaging with consumers in every possible way. As over 91% of Americans will own a mobile device by the end of 2011 (including mobile phones, smartphones and tablets), and with the global digital signage market estimated to grow at 8.3 percent, or about $26.4 billion in 2011 alone, the transition of major brands from television to digital signage-mobile advertising represents a massive shift in how companies and advertisers are allocating their budgets.iSIGN's technology lies at the intersection of digital interactivity and customer engagement - enabling digital signs to interact and talk to nearby mobile devices, and offering a marketing solution that provides brands with the ability to connect and engage their core customers in a unique, effective and immediate way, and in very close proximity.Personal, Private and MeasurableiSIGN's latest development, the Smart Antenna (SA) is a connected technology platform that is helping brands and advertisers develop more effective and efficient engagement campaigns; deepening their connection with consumers, increasing brand interaction and encouraging more loyalty, while driving more measurable transactions.
