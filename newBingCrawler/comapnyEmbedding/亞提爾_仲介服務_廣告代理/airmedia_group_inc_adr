Gold deepens pullback from nearly 8-week highs as dollar index stabilizes
              
              Gold slipped Thursday but continued to hover near the more than seven-week highs struck to start the week. Though the economic docket is full Thursday, investors are largely digging in for Friday’s jobs report and any clues there for the likelihood of a follow-up U.S. interest-rate hike yet this year.

AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: AMCN) got some lift early Wednesday, on word the Beijing-based operator of out-of-home advertising platforms in China targeting mid-to-high-end consumers as well as a first-mover in the travel Wi-Fi market, entered into Amendment No. 3 transaction for going private.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, either the Company or its parent could terminate the pact if the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not been completed by Friday. The Merger Agreement Amendment No. 3 extends the Termination Date to July 31, so as to give the Special Committee sufficient time to consider the Revised Proposal. A special committee of the Board received a proposed amendment to the merger agreement from several directors on May 23 to: acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company not already owned by the Buyer Group for $4.00 per American Depositary Share or $2.00 per ordinary share in cash; and extend the termination date to December 31, 2017. The company said the Special Committee is evaluating the revised proposal with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors. AirMedia sells advertisements on the routes operated by several Chinese airlines and at Sinopec's service stations in China. AirMedia also has concession rights to operate the Wi-Fi systems on trains administered by eight railway administrative bureaus in China as well as on many long-haul buses in China. New York-based shares of the Chinese conglomerate mounted a charge mid-morning Wednesday, growing 21 cents or 9.2%, to $2.51.

Fourth Day in a Row of Gains for AirMedia Group Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:AMCN) 

 

0100AirMedia Group Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:AMCN)
Shares of China-based AirMedia Group Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:AMCN) are up for the fourth day in a row. Last Friday, AMCN shares established a new 52-week low and closed at $1.40 and, with 45 minutes left in today’s trading session, are hovering around $2.35. Today’s volumes have been this week’s heaviest so far. Over 3.1 million shares have traded hands and the listed 30-day, daily average volume for shares of AMCN is just 328,670.
AirMedia Group Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:AMCN) sells advertising on its air travel advertising network. AirMedia also holds concession rights to install and operate Wi-Fi systems on trains, administered by over eight regional railway administrative bureaus in China, and on various long-haul buses in China. AirMedia has access to 71,900 airplane digital television screens on over five airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines. It also holds concession rights to operate the advertising media platforms at Sinopec gas stations across China.
While AMCN shares have gained over 27% during the past week, they have lost over 22% YTD, and are down over 50% for the year. However, interestingly, AMCN shares have been trading at a discount to their cash per share figure for some time. Financial data providers have AMCN’s cash/share value listed at $3.90. A review of historical prices shows that AMCN shares have traded over $3.50 just three times since last July. However investors should be aware that AirMedia Group Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:AMCN) is based in China and some observers sometimes doubt the veracity of financial statements that lack a similar oversight structure as their American counterparts. Its also relevant to observe that sales have been steadily declining since 2012 when the company posted a figure over $286 million only to post a figure of $50.2 million in 2015. Similarly, earnings losses have widened over the years. In 2013, shareholders lost (-$0.48) per share and that loss expanded to (-$1.16) by 2015.
I have no positions in any of the stocks mentioned, and have no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. All information, including any data, is provided without any guarantees of accuracy.
