History[edit]
ReachLocal was founded in 2003 by Zorik Gordon, Nathan Hanks, Michael Kline, Robert Wright, and Robert “Rick” Spitz,[4] with headquarters in Woodland Hills, California and operations in four global regions.
ReachLocal has over 1,300 employees across 68 offices[6] located in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Austria, India, Belgium, and Japan.[7] As of February 2016, the company has more than 17,000 active clients.[8] ReachLocal operated in the United Kingdom until December 2015 when they entered Administration. Fat Media purchased the UK assets, customer contracts and goodwill from ReachLocal UK Ltd.[9]
ReachLocal’s first product was a search engine advertising service[10] called ReachSearch. This technology places businesses’ advertisements on multiple search engines, including Google, Yahoo! and Bing.[11] ReachLocal has since introduced a range of digital marketing products, including ReachEdge, its award-winning lead conversion software.[12]
In 2010, ReachLocal launched its initial public offering (IPO).[13] Before the company’s IPO, ReachLocal was venture-backed by VantagePoint Venture Partners, Rho Ventures and Galleon Special Opportunities Partners Fund LP.[14]
In April 2014, ReachLocal appointed B2B and information services veteran leader Sharon Rowlands as Chief Executive Officer and member of its board of directors, replacing interim CEO David Carlick.[15]
In June 2016, the company was acquired by Gannett Co. for about $156 million.[16]
Services[edit]
In addition to search engine marketing, ReachLocal provides other online marketing solutions for their clients. In 2005, the company launched ReachSearch, a search engine advertising product designed to attract more leads from consumers. The product achieves this by placing text advertisements on leading search engines and directories.[17]
In 2009, ReachLocal introduced ReachDisplay, an online display advertising service that places banner advertisements on premium websites. The following year, the company built ReachCast, a web marketing service, and launched a site retargeting product called ReachRemarketing in 2011.[18]
ReachRetargeting was launched in 2012 and combined the site retargeting technology of ReachRemarketing with a new feature set that also included search retargeting. This was followed by the launch of award-winning website and lead management system ReachEdge in 2013. Within six months, ReachEdge had launched over 1000 client websites.[19] In 2014, ReachLocal introduced a search engine optimization service, ReachSEO.[10] In 2015, ReachLocal launched ReachListings, a local listings management solution.[20] In 2016, ReachLocal launched ReachSocial Ads,[21] a Facebook advertising solution, and enhanced their SEO solution, ReachSEO.[22]
Technology[edit]
ReachLocal has developed a proprietary technology platform to serve their customers.[4][23] The company has also developed various technologies to assist their clients in publishing their campaigns and tracking, optimizing and reporting results for a variety of their services.[24] In September 2012, the company released the first ReachLocal mobile application, which provides real-time lead notifications and reports to their clients,[25] followed by the ReachEdge app in 2013. Both applications are available for Apple iOS and Android.[26][27]
ReachEdge, the company’s marketing automation platform released in 2013, provides clients with a list of leads, sources, actions needed, performance and reports. The platform consists of a website, lead management software and the aforementioned mobile application.[27]
In February 2014, ReachLocal released LigerMobile, an open source framework that assists in the development of hybrid apps.[27][28]
Awards[edit]
In 2009, Inc. Magazine ranked ReachLocal number 39 on its Inc. 500 list, and was named on the list for a second time in 2010.[29]
Search Engine Watch named ReachLocal as a finalist for “Best Search Engine Marketing Technology Platform for Small- to Medium-Sized Businesses” in 2009. paidContent also named the company in its “Most Successful Digital Media Companies in the United States” list in the same year.[29]
The American Business Awards selected the company as a “Most Innovative Company of the Year” finalist in 2009 and 2010.[29]
In 2009, ReachLocal was ranked number one on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 list.[30] The company also featured on the list in 2010,[31] 2011,[32] 2012[33] and 2013.[34]
In 2010, ReachLocal won a Mashable Award for “Best Social Media Service for Small Businesses.”[29]
