About Nesco 




Established in 1939 April as the New Standard Engineering Co. Ltd. (NSE), the company is known as a pioneer in the tool manufacturing segment, as it brought into the country, world class processes and designs for the manufacture of a number of engineering products. Equipment such as forging hammers and presses, blowroom lines and high production cards for the textile industry; and sucker rod pumps for on-shore oil recovery were some of the main product lines that emerged as market leaders. As the products manufactured were high in quality, the company soon saw an incremental rise in its exports, and not only are it products market leaders in India, but also have found a niche overseas.

                              Today, the Engineering Group of Nesco, continues to be a leading provider of this equipment to the Indian Railways, numerous Ordnance Factories, and Forging Plants.
