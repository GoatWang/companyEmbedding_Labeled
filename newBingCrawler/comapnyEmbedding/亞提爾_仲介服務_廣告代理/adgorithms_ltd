Press Release




Adgorithms Announces Amy Inlow as New Chief Marketing Officer
New York, NY, July 2016
Adgorithms Inc., (LSE: ADGO), a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) marketing and advertising solutions, today announced Amy Inlow as the company’s new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). As CMO, Inlow’s primary task will be raising awareness for Adgorithms’ “Albert” the first-ever autonomous marketing platform capable of executing highly targeted and effective marketing and advertising campaigns across channels – paid and nonpaid – and devices, at a pace and scale that is no longer humanly possible. Improving its performance through optimization and self-learning and providing full transparency every step of the way, Albert frees marketers to focus on higher value problem solving.
An award-winning marketer with 20 years of strategic marketing and communications experience in the technology industry, Inlow comes to Adgorithms from Tracx where, as CMO, she led the company’s go-to-market strategy. During her tenure at Tracx, the company won more than sixteen awards for their best-in-class product, and her team was recognized by B2BMarketer as a finalist for their account-based marketing strategy.
Prior to Tracx, Inlow spent several years at Experian Marketing Services leading the transformation of the CheetahMail organization and brand, to cross-channel marketing, and finally to the Marketing Suite. While at Experian, Inlow built and oversaw a marketing team and lead generation machine that influenced more than 70 percent of the company’s pipeline, quadrupling the amount of quality, inbound leads through aggressive content marketing, which consistently beat best-in-class funnel and pipeline contribution metrics. Inlow also established and ran Experian’s Client Advisory Board, which consisted of top marketers from several marquee brands. Before Experian, Inlow held global marketing leadership roles at Operative and LivePerson.
“There’s been an overabundance of noise in the adtech and martech worlds with the move to digital – and across numerous channels and devices. Having a great product is only half the battle. To stand out, you must have effective marketing,” said Adgorithms CEO and Founder Or Shani. “Amy has been at the helm for several breakthrough marketing initiatives over the course of her career, and she possesses a natural ability to make complex technologies easily understood. We’re thrilled, and lucky, to have her.”
Inlow holds a BA in Communications and English from Boston College and lives in Connecticut with her family.
About Adgorithms
Founded in 2010, Adgorithms liberates marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing.

Albert also offers proactive, ongoing insights and recommendations on information he has learned and uncovered along his journey. Leading brands such as Harley Davidson and Made.com are leveraging Albert’s artificial intelligence capabilities to increase and accelerate revenue, make more informed investment decisions and reduce operational costs – and do it at a pace and scale that has not previously been possible.

Adgorithms Ltd.


('Adgorithms' or 'the Company')


Company name change


Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to 'Albert Technologies Ltd.'.


The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.


From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.


The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/


Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, 'This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations.'

About Albert Technologies Ltd.

Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand.This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offersartificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.

The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.


About Albert


Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.


Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.


Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.

Adgorithms Ltd (ALB)



Adgorithms Ltd

Company name change

RNS Number : 8714K Adgorithms Limited 12 July 2017  

12 July 2017
 
 
Adgorithms Ltd.
("Adgorithms" or "the Company")
Company name change
 
 
Adgorithms (AIM: ADGO), the Artificial Intelligence marketing platform, today announces that it has been given permission by the Israeli Registrar of Companies to change its name to "Albert Technologies Ltd.".
The Directors believe the new name better reflects the Company's core business of developing and promoting the Albert technology behind its Software as a Service product. It also comes as a result of increasing recognition for Albert, both in terms of his growing client base and recent awards.
From 8.00 a.m. on Thursday 13 July 2017, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on AIM  under the new name of Albert Technologies Ltd. and the new TIDM of ALB.L (previously ADGO.L). The Company's ISIN (IL0011354904) and SEDOL (BX7RHQ9) will remain the same and existing share certificates will remain valid and will not be replaced. The resolution to change the name of the Company was conditionally approved at its AGM held on 22 June 2017.
The website address, at which the information required pursuant to AIM Rule 26 is available, will be changed at the same time as the change of name to https://albert.ai/
Or Shani, Founder & CEO at Albert Technologies Ltd. said, "This is a milestone moment as we continue to transition to a business more clearly focused on our leading product, Albert.  We listed to raise funds to invest in Albert's commercialisation and are delighted with his recent progress in the marketplace, where he has won new clients and exceeded their expectations."

About Albert Technologies Ltd.
Albert Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2010 by CEO Or Shani to liberate marketers from the pain and complexities of modern marketing. The Company operates an Indirect Sales Channel, where its technology is deployed in advertising exchanges to match undervalued inventory with suitable demand. This is managed to help support the continued promotion of the strategically significant Direct Sales Channel, which offers artificial intelligence-based software, Albert, to brands using a SaaS model. Albert Technologies Ltd. listed in 2015 to accelerate both investment into and commercialisation of Albert.
The Company and Albert have received many awards in its short existence, including two platinum MarCom awards and silver in the Best in Biz awards 2016 for best new product of the year. Albert was also named AI Application of the Year by The Global Annual Achievement Awards for Artificial Intelligence.
 
About Albert
Albert replaces the human campaign manager in managing a brand's online advertising campaigns. A brand, such as Cosabella or Harley Davidson, provides Albert with access to its Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter and other online marketing channels. When a brand manager wishes to launch a new online advertising campaign, she simply logs into Albert and deploys that new campaign, which is usually no more than a 15 minute task.
 
Albert autonomously creates hundreds of micro campaigns across all relevant online marketing channels (Google, Facebook, Bing, Twitter, Instagram, Display, Email, etc), then reviews these hundreds of micro campaigns every few minutes and optimises each of them as needed. Albert works in very much the same way that a human campaign manager would, making correlation and cost/benefit based decisions.
 
Where an experienced campaign manager could possibly make circa 100 decisions per day, Albert can make thousands per minute. Albert's ability to launch hundreds of micro strategies and review and amend them all every few minutes typically brings about a significant increase in ROI. In addition, all learnings from the decisions made remain in house, so the brand has full and instant transparency and can easy scale up marketing activity through larger budgets or application to new brands and new geographies without hiring new expert campaign managers.
