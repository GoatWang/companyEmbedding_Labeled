	Guangdong Guangzhou Daily Media Company Limited operates within the Advertising agencies sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Guangdong Guangzhou Daily Media Company Limited with three other
	
			companies in this sector in China:
		
	Beijing Tensyn Digital Marketing Technology Joint Stock Co
	
		(2016
	sales of 1.35 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$200.55  million]
		of which 100%
		was Internet Sale),
	
	Sinomedia Holding Limited
	
		(1.30 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$193.14  million]
		of which 100%
		was Advertising Services), and
	
	Shanghai Longyun Advertising & Media Co Ltd
	
		(966.61 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$143.69  million]
		of which 100%
		was Advertising Industry).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Guangdong Guangzhou Daily Media Company Limited were 1.02 billion Chinese Renmimbi (US$151.69 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
			a
			
			decrease of 20.9%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 1.29 billion Chinese Renmimbi.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 37.0% decline
		in Advertising, from 637.93 million Chinese Renmimbi to 401.85 million Chinese Renmimbi.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Publication (down 16.8% to 245.65 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Printing (down 7.8% to 209.57 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Network Services (down 13.1% to 21.58 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Logistics (up 39.2% to 57.80 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Others (up 37.6% to 51.64 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Merchandising (up 24.3% to 22.50 million Chinese Renmimbi)
				
					and
				Hotel Services (up 5.3% to 10.24 million Chinese Renmimbi)

More...Did you know ?On the Infinancials platform, there are two ways to identify the listed peers which most closely resemble a private firm:- with Peer Tracker if you already know a listed peer.Peer Tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications. The degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores.- with Market Screener if you have no listed peer in mind.Market Screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria, identifying peers, searching for comparable companies in a specific business sector.About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
