You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.  As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our" and "our company" mean Logicquest Technology, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.  General Overview  We were originally incorporated as Solis Communications, Inc. on July 23, 2001 and adopted a name change to Crescent Communications Inc. upon completion of a reverse acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc. In 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation. On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc.  We are a Nevada corporation that previously consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business, which provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 our board of directors authorized an orderly wind down of our company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.  Our Current Business  We were previously engaged in the networking service (carrier/circuit) business that provides internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 our board of directors authorized an orderly wind down our company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.  On March 31, 2016, our company entered a memorandum of understanding/letter of intent ("MOU)") with Logicquest Technology Limited pursuant to which we intended to effect a business combination (the "Transaction"). The Transaction was to be effected in one of several different ways, including by asset acquisition, by merger of our company and Logicquest Technology Limited, or by share purchase whereby we would purchase the shares of Logicquest from its shareholders for cash and/or for shares of our company.  The MOU provided that we would pay an aggregate of USD$3,000,000 to the shareholders of Logicquest Technology Limited for all issued and outstanding share of Logicquest Technology Limited, payable as follows:  (a)  $1,000,000 on closing of the Transaction;  (b)  $1,000,000 six months from closing of the Transaction; and  (c)  $1,000,000 on the first anniversary of the closing of the Transaction.  The MOU further provided that the parties would enter into a definitive agreement to complete the Transaction by June 30, 2016. The definitive agreement was to contain provisions that are customary for a transaction of this nature, including, but not be limited to,  (a)  approvals of the boards of directors of Logicquest and us and shareholders of Logicquest;  (b)  obtaining all required consents of third parties;  (c)  completion of all required audited and unaudited financial statements of Logicquest, prepared in accordance with US GAAP and audited and by a PCAOB registered audit firm;  (d)  no adverse material change in the business or financial condition of Logicquest or us since the execution of the Transaction Agreement; and  (e)  closing of Transaction by June 30, 2016.  On July 22, 2016 we entered into a letter of agreement with Logicquest Technology to extend the deadline for closing the Transaction from June 30, 2016 to October 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016 the Letter of Intent expired prior to the completion of a definitive agreement to complete the Transaction.  As at the date of this report, we have no additional plans to pursue a business combination with Logicquest Technology Limited. Our management intends to seek and evaluate opportunities to create value for our shareholders through merger or acquisition.  Results of Operations  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  We had a net loss of $362,358 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, which was $8,859 more than the net loss of $353,499 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The change in our results over the two periods is a result of an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.  The following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three Three Months Months Nine Months Nine Months Nine Months Ended Ended Ended Ended Increase September September September September 2016 from 30, 2016 30, 2015 30, 2016 30, 2015 2015 Revenue $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - Selling, general and administrative expenses 40,266 39,702 121,740 113,431 8,309 Loss from operations (40,266 ) (39,702 ) (121,740 ) (113,431 ) 8,309 Interest expense (80,573 ) (80,573 ) (240,618 ) (240,068 ) 550 Net loss $ (120,839 ) $ (120,275 ) $ (362,358 ) $ (353,499 ) $ 8,859  Revenue  We have not earned any revenues during the quarter of September 30, 2016 and we do not anticipate earning revenues in the upcoming quarter.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were nil; total current liabilities were $4,097,511 and total stockholders' deficit was $4,073,020.  Working Capital At At September 30, December 31, 2016 2015 Current assets $ 7,798 $ 29,032 Current liabilities 4,097,511 3,739,694 Working capital $ (4,089,713 ) $ (3,710,662 )  We anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations further in the future.  Financial Condition Increase Nine Months Ended (Decrease) September 30 2016 from 2016 2015 2015 Net cash (used in) operating activities $ - $ - $ - Net cash provided by financing activities - - - Net decrease in cash during period $ - $ - $ - Cash balance at end of period - -  Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was nil and nil during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Financing Activities  Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was nil and nil during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  To date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from officers and directors, related companies and an independent third party in order to sustain our basic, minimum operating expenses; however, we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our officers and directors, related companies or the independent third party will provide us with any future loans. We intend to use debt to cover the anticipated negative cash flows until we can operate at a break-even cash flow mode. We may seek additional capital to fund potential costs associated with possible expansion and/or acquisitions. We believe that future funding may be obtained from public or private offerings of equity securities, debt or convertible debt securities, or other sources. Stockholders should assume that any additional funding will likely be dilutive.  We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Future Financings  We anticipate continuing to rely on loans from a related company. We may obtain funding through equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.  We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material.  We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  Revenue Recognition  Our company's internet connectivity business ceased effective June 30, 2014. Our company has currently no business.  Stock-Based Compensation  Accounting Standard 718, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("ASC 718") established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. In January 2006, we implemented ASC 718, and accordingly, we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.  We account for share based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 "Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services".  Derivative Financial Instruments  We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments, we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  Going Concern  We remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated March 30, 2016 (included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015), which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from a related party.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we experienced negative financial results as follows:   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Net loss $ (362,358 ) $ (353,499 ) Negative working capital (4,089,713 ) (3,577,734 ) Stockholders' deficit (4,073,020 ) (3,577,734 )  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future.  Nov 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

 Educational Background



BBA in Accounting 


Pace University - New York

                  Since 1906, Pace University has produced thinking professionals by providing high-quality education for the professions with a firm base in liberal learning amid the advantages of the New York Metropolitan Area. A private university, Pace has campuses in New York City and Westchester County, enrolling almost 13,000 students in bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs in its College of Health Professions, Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, Lubin School of Business, School of Education, School of Law, and Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems. Pace is a University whose resources have played an essential role in the realization of individual dreams of achievement, and whose mission is voiced in the motto: Opportunitas.

Pace Institute began its transformation after World War II into a modern university with emphasis on the liberal arts and sciences. With dynamic leadership and fiscally sound management, Pace grew from rented facilities and few resources into one of the largest universities in New York State, with a multimillion dollar physical plant, an endowment of nearly $100 million and a reputation for excellent teaching and talented, ambitious graduates. 

At the heart of Pace’s academic values is a historic commitment to excellence in teaching, as manifested by small classes, an emphasis on skill development and critical thinking, special tutoring and support services, and academic advising. Academic experiences at Pace emphasize teaching from both a practical and theoretical perspective, drawing on the expertise of full-time and adjunct faculty members who balance academic preparation with professional experience to bring a unique dynamic to the classroom.

The University supports and encourages scholarly activity among its intellectually vital faculty. Much of the work has professional application, and Pace particularly invites scholarship that directly relates to the classroom experience and involves students in the research process. Additionally, Pace has recognized the importance of educating students with a global perspective; Pace is building an increasing array of study abroad options, a successful mentoring program that has produced 37 Fulbright scholars since 2002, and a focus on international recruitment.

Pace University in the 21st century is shaped by its enduring traditions of opportunity and innovation. More than 100 years after its founding, the University continues its commitment to providing access to a diverse population while innovating to meet the needs of the global economy.

	INTRODUCTION





	Logicquest Technology, Inc. (the Company) was originally incorporated as Solis Communications, Inc. on July 23, 2001 and adopted a name change to Crescent Communications Inc. upon completion of a reverse acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc. In 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation (Bluegate). On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc.





	Logicquest is a Nevada corporation that previously consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business, which provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 the Board of Directors authorized an orderly wind down of the Company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.





	In this Form 10-K, we refer to ourselves as "Logicquest," "We," Us," the Company, and "Our."





	Our executive offices are located at: Logicquest Technology, Inc., 5 Independence Way, Suite 300, Princeton, NJ, U.S.A.; tel. voice: 609-514-5136, fax: 609-514-5104. Our website is logq-inc.com





	Our growth is dependent on attaining profit from acquiring new operations and our raising capital through the sale of stock or debt. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit.





	Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated March 30, 2016, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.





	Our stock is traded on the OTCQ Over-The-Counter market and our trading symbol is LOGQ.





	CORPORATE HISTORY





	In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). Two of the many features of HIPAA were a mandate that the healthcare industry move toward using electronic communication technology to streamline and reduce the cost of healthcare, and a requirement that healthcare providers treat virtually all healthcare information as confidential, especially when electronically transmitted.





	In 2001, Mr. Manfred Sternberg acquired effective control of the company and during 2002 and 2003 under his leadership, the company commenced development and completion of the necessary systems to offer integrated HIPAA compliant Medical Grade Network® to the health care community to provide electronic systems required by increasing U.S. public policy mandates to accelerate the movement to secure electronic health records.





	In 2003, a minority amount of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2004, a majority of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2005, all of our revenues were related to our health care service model.





	In 2004, to accelerate our movement into the electronic health record business, we sold our Internet Service Provider ("ISP") customer base effective June 21, 2004 to concentrate on our health care IT solutions model and its Medical Grade Network®.





	In 2004, we contracted with the largest healthcare system in Texas to provide physicians with Internet bandwidth and managed security services using our Medical Grade Network®.





	In March 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of TEKMedia Communications, Inc., a company that provided traditional IT consulting services.





	In September 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of Trilliant Corporation, a company that provides assessment, design, vendor selection, procurement and project management for large technology initiatives, particularly in the healthcare arena.





	Effective May 31, 2009, Mr. Koehler resigned as President from the company.









	1







	 





	Effective July 29, 2009, Charles Leibold became a Director as a result of: (A) the June 12, 2009 written consent of a majority of our shareholders; (B) the June 22, 2009 filing of a Preliminary Information Statement; (C) the July 8, 2009 filing of a Definitive Information Statement; and, (D) the July 9, 2009 mailing of the Definitive Information Statement to our shareholders. The Definitive Information Statement had a record date of June 25, 2009.





	Effective July 30, 2009, the titles of CEO and President were combined, and Stephen Sperco was appointed President. Mr. Sperco is our former CEO/President/Director. Stephen Sperco was appointed Chairman of the Board. The executive officer position of Chief Strategy Officer was eliminated and Mr. Sternbergs employment was terminated.





	Effective November 7, 2009, the Company entered into the following transactions: 1) disposed of certain Medical Grade Network (MGN) assets and business and the elimination of certain liabilities (consisting primarily of: a) furniture, computers and related software and peripherals with a $17,889 book value; b) contracts, agreements, lists of telephone and fax numbers, licenses, permits, intellectual properties, registered mark for MGN, and business name of Bluegate with a $0 net book value; c) eliminated liabilities of $43,607 principally related to customer product prepays which were assumed by the purchaser) to Sperco, LLC (Sperco) (an entity controlled by Stephen Sperco (SS), our former CEO/President/Director) for $200,000, with payment made by a combination of $100,000 cash and $100,000 forgiveness of debt to SAI Corporation (SAIC) (an entity controlled by SS), plus a net adjustment of $7,100 due to the Company from Sperco resulting from the Companys collection of principally accounts receivable totaling $161,900 on behalf of Sperco for the period from November 8, 2009 through December 31, 2009, offset by Spercos payment of $169,000 to the Company for the personnel, facilities, tools, and resources necessary for the Company to support both the MGN and HIMS operations for Sperco for the same period; 2) entered into a Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with Manfred Sternberg (MS) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,369 to MS; and 3) entered into A Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with William Koehler (WK) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,374 with a direct payment to WKs American Express account and a $1 payment to WK; and 4) disposed of certain Trilliant Technology Group, Inc.s assets and business (consisting primarily of: a) Computers and related software and peripherals with a $0 net book value; b) lists of telephone and fax numbers and intellectual properties with a $0 net book value) to Trilliant Corporation (an entity controlled by WK) for a cash payment of $5,000; and 5) disposed of certain Bluegate Healthcare Information Management Systems (HIMS) assets and business (consisting primarily of: a) Contracts, agreements and intellectual properties with a $0 net book value) to SAIC in exchange for a Mutual Release in Full of certain claims and a $1 payment to SAIC; and 6) obtained a Fairness Opinion dated November 6, 2009 presented by Convergent Capital Appraisers.





	Pursuant to the State of Nevada Revised Statutes, which authorizes the taking of action by written consent of the shareholders without a meeting, a super majority of the voting power of the shareholders of the Company gave their consent to the above actions. In April 2010, the Company filed a Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC and mailed the notice to shareholders.





	As a result of these transactions, the Company received $105,000 cash; reduced the secured note payable to SAIC by $100,000; paid off unsecured notes payable and accrued interest of $88,743 to MS and WK; eliminated $56,998 of accrued liabilities to MS and WK; recorded $24,234 of expenses (principally legal and professional); removed the remaining book value of fixed assets of $17,889, eliminated $43,607 of customer liabilities assumed by Sperco and the net effect of $263,484 as an increase to additional paid-in capital since the effect was treated as related party forgiveness of debt.





	On December 27, 2010 our 100% owned subsidiary, Trilliant Technology Group, Inc. was dissolved.





	On September 11, 2014, SAIC, the Companys majority shareholder, sold to Mr. Ang Woon Han 24,070,250 shares of common stock (1,203,513 shares post reverse stock split), 48 shares of Series C Convertible preferred stock and 10 shares of Series D Convertible preferred stock. As a result, Mr. Ang owns 52% of our shares of common stock without taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred stock, and 78% when taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred Stock.





	On January 2, 2015, the Company had filed a 14C for restructuring the Company. Actions taken included:














	·




	To change the name of the Company from Bluegate Corporation to Logicquest Technology, Inc.






	·




	To increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 from fifty million (50,000,000) to two hundred million (200,000,000) (the Authorized Increase); and






	·




	To perform a reverse stock split of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one post-split share per twenty pre-split shares (the Reverse Stock Split).









	The above actions were effective on March 19, 2015.

	OUR BUSINESS SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOVEMBER 7, 2009 DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND BUSINESS





	For the first half of 2014, Logicquest consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business that provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 the Board of Directors authorized an orderly wind down of the Company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.





	LOGICQUEST STRATEGY





	Following the name change and reverse split, we are in active search of some businesses in the high tech industry that will provide good value to shareholders.





	EMPLOYEES

	EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS





	The Company had adopted the 2002 Stock and Stock Option Plan under which incentive stock options for up to 22,500 common shares may be awarded to officers, directors and key employees. The plan was designed to attract and reward key executive personnel. As of December 31, 2007, we had granted all 22,500 options and the 2002 stock plan is not active. Stock options granted pursuant to the 2002 plan expire as determined by the board of directors, and all options granted under the 2002 stock plan have expired prior hereto. All of the options granted were at an option price equal to the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant.

	In 2005 we adopted the 2005 Stock and Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Plan"). The purpose of the 2005 Plan is to further our interests, our subsidiaries and our stockholders by providing incentives in the form of stock options to key employees, consultants, directors and others who contribute materially to our success and profitability. The grants recognize and reward outstanding individual performances and contributions and will give such persons a proprietary interest in us, thus enhancing their personal interest in our continued success and progress. The 2005 Plan also assists us and our subsidiaries in attracting and retaining key employees and Directors. The 2005 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has the exclusive power to select the participants in the 2005 Plan, to establish the terms of the stock and options granted to each participant, provided that all options granted shall be granted at an exercise price equal to at least 85% of the fair market value of the common stock covered by the option on the grant date and to make all determinations necessary or advisable under the 2005 Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be granted or optioned and sold under the Plan is 150,000 shares. As of December 31, 2016, 56,635 shares of common stock have been granted pursuant to the 2005 Plan.

	The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the discussions under Application of Critical Accounting Policies, which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our financial statements.






	OVERVIEW






	Logicquest consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business that provides internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During 2014, our business volume was dropped sharply compared with 2013, and the management by then had decided to cease the business on June 30, 2014. Mr. Ang Woon Han took over the majority of Logicquest on September 11, 2014 through the purchase of shares from SAI Corporation, the then largest shareholder. Mr. Ang is exploring to acquire promising new businesses in 2017, either through the issuance of shares or through financing.






	OUR CURRENT BUSINESS






	We were previously engaged in the networking service (carrier/circuit) business that provides internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 our board of directors authorized an orderly wind down our companys internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.





	On March 31, 2016, our Company entered a


	memorandum of understanding/letter of intent (

	MOU

	)) with Logicquest Technology Limited pursuant to which we intended to effect a business combination (the 

	Transaction

	).  The Transaction was to be effected in one of several different ways, including by asset acquisition, by merger of our company and Logicquest Technology Limited, or by share purchase whereby we would purchase the shares of Logicquest from its shareholders for cash and/or for shares of our company.





	The MOU provided that we would pay an aggregate of USD$3,000,000 to the shareholders of Logicquest Technology Limited for all issued and outstanding share of Logicquest Technology Limited, payable as follows:





	(a)


	$1,000,000 on closing of the Transaction;


	(b)


	$1,000,000 six months from closing of the Transaction; and


	(c)


	$1,000,000 on the first anniversary of the closing of the Transaction.






	5







	 





	The MOU further provided that the parties would enter into a definitive agreement to complete the Transaction by June 30, 2016. The definitive agreement was to contain provisions that are customary for a transaction of this nature, including, but not be limited to,





	(a)


	approvals of the boards of directors of Logicquest and us and shareholders of Logicquest;


	(b)


	obtaining all required consents of third parties;


	(c)


	completion of all required audited and unaudited financial statements of Logicquest, prepared in accordance with US GAAP and audited and by a PCAOB registered audit firm;


	(d)


	no adverse material change in the business or financial condition of Logicquest or us since the execution of the Transaction Agreement; and


	(e)


	closing of Transaction by June 30, 2016.





	On July 22, 2016 we entered into a letter of agreement with Logicquest Technology to extend the deadline for closing the Transaction from June 30, 2016 to October 31, 2016.  On October 31, 2016 the Letter of Intent expired prior to the completion of a definitive agreement to complete the Transaction.  





	As at the date of this report, we have no additional plans to pursue a business combination with Logicquest Technology Limited.  Our management intends to seek and evaluate opportunities to create value for our shareholders through merger or acquisition.








	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	We had a net loss of $497,268 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was $10,841 more than the net loss of $486,427 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in our results over the two periods is mainly a result of an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.

	Operating Activities.






	Net cash used in operating activities was nil during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.






	Financing Activities.






	Cash provided by financing activities was nil during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.





	To date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from officers and directors, related companies and an independent third party in order to sustain our basic, minimum operating expenses; however, we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares or that our officers and directors, related companies or the independent third party will provide us with any future loans.  We intend to use debt to cover the anticipated negative cash flows until we can operate at a break-even cash flow mode. We may seek additional capital to fund potential costs associated with possible expansion and/or acquisitions. We believe that future funding may be obtained from public or private offerings of equity securities, debt or convertible debt securities, or other sources. Stockholders should assume that any additional funding will likely be dilutive.





	We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.






	FORECAST






	The internet connectivity business of our company ceased on June 30, 2014. The management is seeking potential merger or acquisition candidates.






	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES






	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. These estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and these differences may be material.





	We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.






	Stock-Based Compensation






	Accounting Standard 718, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("ASC 718") established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. In January 2006, we implemented ASC 718, and accordingly, we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.





	We account for share based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.

	GOING CONCERN






	We remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated March 30, 2017, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.





	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from related parties and independent third parties. We experienced negative financial results as follows:

	These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future.





	Our current operations are primarily funded by Logicquest Technology Limited, a company controlled by the Companys Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Cheng Yew Siong.





	These steps have provided us with the cash flows to continue our business, but have not resulted in significant improvement in our financial position. We are considering alternatives to address our cash flow situation that include:














	·




	Raising capital through additional sale of our common stock and/or debt securities.






	·




	Reducing cash operating expenses to levels that are in line with current revenues.









	These alternatives could result in substantial dilution of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that our current financial position can be improved, that we can raise additional working capital or that we can achieve positive cash flows from operations. Our long-term viability as a going concern is dependent upon the following:














	·




	Our ability to locate sources of debt or equity funding to meet current commitments and near-term future requirements.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM









	Board of Directors and Stockholders


	Logicquest Technology, Inc.





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Logicquest Technology, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Logicquest Technology, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	1.

	ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Logicquest Technology, Inc. (we, our, the Company") is a Nevada Corporation that previously consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business. It provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider until it ceased operations effective June 30, 2014.





	The Company was originally incorporated as Solis Communications, Inc. on July 23, 2001 and adopted a name change to Crescent Communications Inc. upon completion of a reverse acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc. In 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation (Bluegate). On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc. (Logicquest).





	Following is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies:






	SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods. Actual results could differ from estimates making it reasonably possible that a change in the estimates could occur in the near term.






	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	A related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Companys securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Companys management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.






	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS






	For certain of the Companys financial instruments, including prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities.





	Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.





	It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due to  related parties and lease and management arrangement with related parties, if any, due to their related party nature.






	INCOME TAXES






	The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial amounts at year-end. The Company provides a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value.









	F-7








	LOGICQUEST TECHNOLOGY, INC.




	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED



	 





	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.






	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION






	Accounting Standard 718, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (ASC 718) established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation. The Company accounts for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.





	The Company accounts for share based compensation to non-employees in accordance with Accounting Standard 505-50 Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.






	LOSS PER SHARE






	Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive options that were outstanding during 2016 and 2015 were not considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the Company's net loss rendered their impact anti-dilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted losses per share were identical for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.






	RECLASSIFICATIONS






	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings and financial position.






	RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	The Company does not expect any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact to its financial position or result of operations.










	2.

	GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS






	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support our operations and have been dependent on debt raised from a related party. We experienced negative financial results as follows:

	These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations or sufficient cash flows will occur in the future.

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.








	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation and as described below under Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)). These weaknesses involve our lack of experience with U.S. GAAP requirements, as described in more detail in the next section. Solely as a result of these material weaknesses, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016.





	Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.





	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.





	The Companys internal control over financial reporting included policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Logicquest Technology, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Logicquest Technology, Inc. assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.





	Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Management assessed the effectiveness of Logicquest Technology, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, due to the material weaknesses described below, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.





	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.





	Based on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2016, due to insufficiently qualified accounting and other finance personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience, and lack of segregation of duties. Management believes that our lack of experience with U.S. GAAP and lack of segregation of duties constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.





	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report.

	Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting





	There were no changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by the Annual Report on Form 10-K that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
