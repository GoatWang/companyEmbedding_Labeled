What is affiliate marketing?
Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a retailer rewards one or more publishers (referred to as “affiliates”) for each visitor or customer brought by the publisher’s own marketing efforts. The publisher is usually rewarded for a pre-defined action, such as a sale, a newsletter registration, a download or a click. Essentially, publishers act as an outsourced sales team for the advertiser, promoting their products and getting rewarded, most often, on a percentage of the basket value.

What’s in it for me?
There are many reasons to use the affiliate model, in favour of other monetisation routes:
Rewards
The payout to publishers is usually higher than you can get via other metrics. A cost-per-acquisition (CPA) model, where the advertiser pays out a percentage of the basket value, can deliver significant rewards to publishers and also reward them based on what is sold.
Transparency
Via tracking platforms, such as affiliate networks, publishers are able to see a range of metrics including what was bought from individual retailers, providing an unrivalled level of transparency.
Additional Revenue
Affiliate marketing is a great way to extend and complement your existing revenue streams.
Control
With affiliate marketing you get to choose which advertisers to promote, and control of the message as well as the creative. No other form of digital marketing allows this.
Flexibility
Anyone can promote an affiliate programme via their site, newsletter, app, social profile or other means. You have the flexibility to control the content that appears on your site.
Our client development teams will work with you to ensure that you are in touch with the advertiser programmes that will be the most effective for your website.

Tradedoubler is a digital marketing company based in Stockholm, Sweden. It was founded in 1999 by Felix Hagnö and Martin Lorentzon and was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2005.
Company[edit]
Tradedoubler has nine offices: Sweden, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Poland. It pioneered affiliate marketing and is the only company to offer both a network and technology solution. The Tradedoubler network includes over 180,000 website publishers and over 2,500 advertisers.
History[edit]
On 15 January 2007, Tradedoubler received a buyout offer from AOL for SEK 6,332 million. This offer was later withdrawn by AOL on 15 March 2007 because of reluctance from the shareholders to sell.
On 25 July 2007, Tradedoubler acquired Interactive Marketing Works Ltd and subsidiaries ('The IMW Group') for £56 million. The IMW Group consists of two trading entities, 'The Search Works', a well established search engine marketing agency and 'The Technology Works', a technology provider for search engine marketing which is in an investment phase, whose products include 'BidBuddy' - a search management technology.
On 20 October 2009, Tradedoubler rebranded The Search Works to td Search across its European markets. The Tradedoubler product portfolio now includes: affiliate network (td Affiliate), ad network (td Campaigns), PPC and SEO (td Search), online tracking and measurement technology (td Integral).
On 9 November 2011, Tradedoubler agreed to transfer all of their search assets (td Search) to NetBooster.[1]
Tradedoubler appointed Matthias Stadelmeyer as CEO in April 2014 in a move to improve on first-quarter results.[2]
On 17 July 2013, Monterro, a Nordic investment company with a focus on software, became principal owner of Tradedoubler after buying half of the respective holdings of SEB Investment Management, Alecta and the Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund (AP4); these 7.8 million shares represent just over 18% of the firm.[3]
On 26 January 2015 Tradedoubler acquired the independent German technology company, Adnologies. The purchase of the data-driven advertising specialist gave Tradedoubler access to technologies that complement and extend its current offering in line with its new corporate strategy.[4]
In September 2015 Tradedoubler launched Cookieless Tracking technology to allow online behaviour to be tracked, even when a cookie is not present, by creating a device fingerprint.[5] Later in the year it also launched User Journey insights, part of its business intelligence tool, ADAPT.[6]
