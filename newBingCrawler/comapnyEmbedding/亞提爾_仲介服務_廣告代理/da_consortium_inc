DLC Trademarks – Words and Logos Defined
The DesignLights Consortium (“DLC”) has three main registered logo trademarks (“DLC Logos”), which are:


          


DLC also uses and protects the following Trademarks:

“DesignLights Consortium” and
“DLC”

The DLC Logos (pictured above), as well as the Trademarks “DesignLights Consortium” and “DLC” are all either pending applications or registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office and other international trademark offices. These trademarks help make the DLC identity a valuable asset, and like any asset with appreciable value, the trademarks must be properly used and protected.
The DLC Logos and trademarks are not only a valuable asset to NEEP and the DLC, but equally valuable to all members and product manufacturers who qualify. In order to retain that value, all stakeholders must use the DLC Logos and trademarks consistently and in compliance with these Guidelines in all communication and outreach materials. Ensuring that the DLC Logos and Trademarks are properly used protects every DLC stakeholder’s investment in the program—and consumer confidence in the DLC brand.
Authorized Use of the DLC Logos and Trademarks
As a general rule, third parties (i.e., anyone other than NEEP and those granted explicit permission by NEEP) are not allowed to use the DLC Logos without permission. The purpose of the DLC Logo and Trademark Use Guidelines is to provide clarification about how the DLC Logos and Trademarks should be used by its stakeholders. The DLC Logos must always be used pursuant to the specifications in these Guidelines to identify the DLC or participation in the DLC program. Any use that falls outside of these specifications is strictly prohibited.
By participating in the DLC program, you agree to the DLC Logo and Trademark Use Guidelines and all DLC rules and policies, which may be updated from time to time.  You also acknowledge that NEEP is the sole owner of the DLC Logos and Trademark, promise not to interfere with NEEP’s rights in them, and acknowledge that goodwill derived from their use accrues only to NEEP.  NEEP may review use of the branding materials at any time and reserves the right to terminate or modify any use.
The DLC Logos and Trademarks and authorized participation are as follows:
I. The DLC Program Logo:

Used by DLC members: To indicate membership on web pages of their energy efficiency programs.
* DLC members are regional, state, utility, and energy efficiency programs throughout the U.S. and Canada
Lighting Testing Laboratories: To indicate available product testing services necessary for manufacturers to submit an application. NOTE: Laboratories must meet the DLC accreditation requirements to display the logo. The DesignLights Consortium name and marks may not be displayed in test reports or be used in a manner that implies NEEP or DLC endorsement of a laboratory or its services, only that those services are provided to manufacturers.
Other: Additional use of the DLC program logo will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact designlights@neep.

The DLC Program Logo may not be altered, cut apart, separated, or otherwise distorted in perspective or appearance.
The preferred color for the DesignLights Consortium mark is black for the text and yellow for the graphic. Alternate versions are available – such as colors being reversed out to white with yellow graphic are allowed. PLEASE refer to the style guide for information on the Standard and Alternative ways to use the DLC Program Logo.
The DLC Program Logo must be large enough so that the lettering inside the logo is clearly legible in all mediums.
The DLC Program Logo must be clear within “C” space of logo elements from all sides.

COMMON MISTAKES:

To gain access to the official DLC logo files, please contact designlights@neep.org. NOTE: Specific model numbers should be included in all requests for DLC Logo files.
Unauthorized/Improper Use:
Unauthorized and/or improper use of the DLC Logos and Trademarks causes confusion among consumers, which results in tarnishment of the brand and its reputation.  It may also constitute trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false advertising, fraud and/or other violations of law. The DesignLights Consortium actively monitors the use of the DLC Logos and Trademarks, but also requests the assistance of its stakeholders to help police its brand. To report a trademark violation or to ask for a review of materials, please contact designlights@neep.org.
Upon discovery of a DLC Logo or Trademark violation by a manufacturer or distributor, the DLC will take the necessary steps to have that violation corrected as quickly as possible in order to minimize the damage.  The DLC expects that all stakeholders will endeavor to be compliant with these Guidelines and will make all changes requested by the DLC in order to achieve compliance.
In case of DLC logo misuse, NEEP reserves the right to suspend the manufacturer’s program privileges for up to 18 months. This may include a suspension of all currently qualified products, as well as an inability to qualify additional products during the suspension. NEEP will notify the manufacturer of the violation and consequences.
By participating in the DLC program/being a stakeholder, you agree to the DLC Logo and Trademark Use Guidelines and all DLC rules and policies, which may be updated from time to time.  You also acknowledge that NEEP is the sole owner of the DLC Logos and Trademark, promise not to interfere with NEEP’s rights in them, and acknowledge that goodwill derived from their use accrues only to NEEP.  NEEP may review use of the branding materials at any time and reserves the right to terminate or modify any use.
