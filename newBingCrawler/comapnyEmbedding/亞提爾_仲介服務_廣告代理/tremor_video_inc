Mr. Zagorski oversaw the sale of eXelate to Nielsen in March 2015, and continued to manage the business following the acquisition. Prior to eXelate, Mr. Zagorski held leadership positions at WorldNow and MediaSpan, where he oversaw strategy, marketing and business development.

Mark's deep knowledge of the digital advertising industry, and his role in shaping industry data practices that empower premium publishers and enhance advertiser performance make him the right fit for Tremor Video,' said Paul Caine. 'Mark joins us following record results in 2016 for the company and a very strong first quarter. I have great confidence that Mark is the right leader for Tremor Video as we continue to build on our momentum, deliver strong results and drive shareholder value.'
      

        'As someone who has been engaged with the evolution of digital video for over two decades, I've long admired Tremor Video as the most innovative leader in the premium video marketplace. Tremor Video has a strong reputation for pioneering video technology and delivering value for premium publishers and leading brands at scale. These strengths are fundamental to building a world class company that is helping to drive transformative shifts in the advertising landscape,' said Mark Zagorski. 'I am honored and excited to join the company and help further its leadership position. Tremor Video has done a fantastic job growing its business and highlighting the value of video advertising, and I look forward to working with the Board and the executive team to continue to execute on that vision.'
