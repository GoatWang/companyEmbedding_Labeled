Hokkan Holdings and Toyota Tsusho to Enter Beverage Market in Indonesia-Establishing a joint venture for manufacture of PET bottles and OEM beverages-
2011-06-03

Hokkan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Hokkan HD"; President: Tsunefumi Kudo) and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "Toyota Tsusho", President: Jun Karube;) will enter into the beverage market in Indonesia and establish a joint venture, "PT. Hokkan Indonesia" (hereinafter referred to as the "new company"), in order to manufacture PET bottles intended for soft drinks, as well as contracted filling.
 
There has been a significant increase in consumption in Indonesia in recent years, due to the growing economy and increasing population. Consumer needs have diversified as the expansion of the middle class and urbanization of cities progress, and the beverage market has shown significant growth. In these circumstances, both companies aim to establish a new company and to make inroads into the PET bottle soft drink market, where expansion is anticipated in the future. The new company will be equipped with PET bottle manufacturing facilities through to aseptic filling facilities, with a manufacturing capacity reaching five million cases per year (120 million bottles). The aseptic filling facilities make it possible to manufacture high quality and light weight products.
 
Previously Hokkan HD promoted overseas business operations as a group, by establishing contracted filling companies in Malaysia and Vietnam, for the beverage market of Southeast Asia, which is growing significantly. Two of Hokkan HD's subsidiaries, Hokkai Can Co., Ltd., and Nihon Canpack Limited will pursue one of the group strategies, which is comprehensive contracting and manufacturing of PET bottles for the soft drink market, ranging from manufacturing to filling. The container manufacturing capacity of Hokkai Can, one of the foremost comprehensive canning companies in Japan, as well as the quality control organization and new product development capabilities of Nihon Canpack, a major contracted filler company in Japan will be utilized to perform contracted manufacturing of products intended for food and beverage manufacturers locally, as well as in Europe, the United States and Japan.
 
Toyota Tsusho has been making efforts in non-automotive fields, with a variety of business operations implemented in the food industry. Furthermore, Toyota Tsusho will be in charge of providing support for the procurement of raw materials and resources, as well as marketing and corporate management of the new company, utilizing the know-how and networks gained through ample business experience in Indonesia.

Toyo Seikan was established in 1917.
The first automatic can making facility in Japan was installed and commissioned in 1919.
Since then, we have devoted ourselves to the manufacturing of containers based on the fundamental importance of packaging.
We have continued supplying containers as an answer to the needs of our era.
This is how we maintain trust, and achieve excellent performance and strong management.

Packaging & Containers Company Research Reports


Packaging and Containers Companies provide lots of industries, mostly food and drinks, household goods, and pharma sectors, with offerings allowing for the dispensing and protecting of products. These include, among others, carton; aerosol valves; plastic and polyethylene tanks; metal cans; storing and trash bags; glass bottles; damping materials; gift wrappings; steel and plastics drums, or, those made of fiber.
Even with its key end use markets characterized by stability, the Packaging and Containers Industry is not proof against macroeconomic fluctuations. Diversified companies are usually best placed to weather economic down-cycles. To remain a success and reap tangible profits, most industry participants tend to sustain balanced cost structure. However, volatile oil-based product prices can pose a challenge to efficient cost management. Packaging and Container producers are serving customers from pole to pole, especially focusing on the emerging Chinese, Indian and Brazilian markets.
This Catalogue encompasses a batch of research reports giving a full picture of Packaging and Containers Companies along with in-depth reviews of the pertinent industry. The research reports examine companies’ strategic positioning in the marketplace, financial ratios, besides including SWOT analyses. The information on Packaging and Containers Companies’ history, leading products or services, major employees, and more is available in the research reports too.
