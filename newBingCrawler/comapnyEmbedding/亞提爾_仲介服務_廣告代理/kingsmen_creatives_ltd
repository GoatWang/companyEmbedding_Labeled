Kingsmen’s Smart Pop-up Concept – designed to drive retail innovation
 Kingsmen Projects Pte Ltd a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kingsmen Creatives Ltd, introduced a new generation of smart retail pop-up concepts, in collaboration with Robinsons & Co Ltd. at Robinsons the Heeren in Orchard Road, Singapore. The pop-up retail space is embedded with state-of-the-art in-store analytics hardware and software, and adopts a holistic approach driven by measurement of returns on experience through technology. Through media sensors, the footfall and kinetic map of a customer’s movement are captured daily and insightful data is generated, enabling brand merchants to effectively plan their store resource allocation, reformat visual merchandise displays and manage real-time product inventory. Brands within Robinsons are thus given a chance to engage their customers in a unique way beyond the traditional department store floor.
