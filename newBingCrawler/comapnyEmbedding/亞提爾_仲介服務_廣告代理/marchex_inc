SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Marchex, Inc. (NASDAQ:MCHX) today announced the enhancement of its 
      online reputation management product with key new features and new 
      content partnerships to help businesses engage and improve their online 
      reputations. This Marchex product focuses on customer reviews and 
      feedback and listings management, which have become crucial to the 
      health and success of businesses in today’s world where consumers are 
      sharing reviews and feedback in a wide variety of online and mobile 
      forums.
    


      Marchex is announcing four new partnerships with Avvo, CitySquares, 
      MeasuredUp and MojoPages to add their content feeds, enhancing the 
      breadth and depth of the Marchex Reputation Management product. These 
      new partners will bring important new feeds to the more than 30 unique

      customers currently engage with from one central interface. Adding these 
      popular websites to the Marchex Reputation Management product will 
      enhance the ability of businesses to monitor their presence in areas 
      such as customer reviews and social media sites, as well as take the 
      next step to engage directly with customers in order to improve their 
      online reputation.
    

      “Marchex is excited to partner with four leading local content providers 
      whose content supplies important customer feedback about local 
      businesses that can fundamentally impact their reputations and bottom 
      lines,” said Brooks McMahon, senior vice president of small business 
      marketing products at Marchex. “We believe that continually adding high 
      quality, locally- and vertically-focused content to our reputation 
      management product will deliver the best and most comprehensive solution 
      for small businesses to constructively engage with customers.”
    

      "Online reputation is critical to doctors and lawyers building a 
      practice; and Avvo recognizes the special responsibility we have to 
      provide a venue for consumers to rate these professionals," said Josh 
      King, Vice President, Business Development for Avvo. "Our partnership 
      with Marchex and its reputation management product empowers legal and 
      medical professionals to better understand and respond to this consumer 
      feedback."
    

      In addition to the new partnerships, Marchex is adding several features 
      that make it easier and more effective for customers to manage their 
      online presence and reputation. In response to feedback from businesses 
      using Marchex Reputation Management, Marchex is increasing its focus on 
      automation so that businesses can make the most impact with the least 
      amount of effort on their part. There are several new features such as:
    


        Personal Insights – improvement to the product dashboard so it’s 
        easier for businesses to view all new reviews, mentions and listings 
        activity – which include social media and blog mentions in real time.
      

        Listings Plus – a new listings submission service that submits a 
        business address to 100+ online local and mobile directories as well 
        as social media sites in order to ensure accurate listings everywhere 
        consumers are looking for business information.
      

        Customer Communications – a new tool that enables small businesses to 
        easily promote their social network profiles and encourages customers 
        to share their positive experiences across online review sites. This 
        tool offers an email template that can be customized and directs 
        customers to selected review sites.

Seattle (PRESS RELEASE – October 15, 2009) – Marchex  , Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHX), a leading local search and performance advertising company, today announced the beta version of Reputation Management, a simple-to-use, online marketing product designed for Small-to-Medium Size Businesses  (SMBs) looking to leverage customer insight to grow their business. The Marchex Reputation Management product is an extension of the award-winning Marchex Connect platform, which supports hundreds of thousands of marketing campaigns for local advertisers.
According to a new BIA/Kelsey local advertising forecast, the E-mail,
Reputation and Presence Management (ERPM) category is expected to grow from $460 million in 2008 to $3.1 billion in 2013. Additionally, the number of SMBs using ERPM will increase from approximately 500,000 to nearly 4 million during the forecast period. As user-generated reviews continue to become more prevalent with consumers, local businesses are seeking ways to leverage this opportunity to ensure their online reputations are kept intact and enhanced. Marchex Reputation Management is intended to give SMBs an information advantage, allowing them to manage their online reputations with a level of detail not previously available in the market.
“SMBs are the heart of local, yet these businesses have yet to find a
cost-effective solution that leverages technology to comprehensively manage their reputations,” said Matt Booth, senior vice president and program director, Interactive Local Media, BIA/Kelsey. “Marchex is well positioned in the ERPM market to help SMBs save valuable time and also improve their online marketing efforts.”
Online Business Intelligence
Marchex Reputation Management was built using proprietary local search technology from Marchex’s Open List local search network. Covering more than 8,000 sources and currently containing more than a quarter billion pieces of meta-data, Marchex Reputation Management monitors and reports on a specific business’ online footprint, including its user reviews and news, blog and social media mentions. In addition, Marchex Reputation Management ensures the accuracy of information in existing online business listings found on general search sites, local search sites and directories, such as consistent business name, address and phone numbers, as well as making recommendations as to where to add new listings for more coverage.  This information is
refreshed daily.
Marchex Reputation Management blends Marchex’s heritage in local search with its proven ability to partner and deliver local advertising solutions.
Specific features include:
–          Reviews: Charts break out the percentage of positive, neutral or negative reviews in an easy-to-read display.
–          Mentions: Charts demonstrate activity by reviews or mentions to tie the information back to particular changes in the business or marketing efforts by month.
–          Business listings: Ensure business listings are accurate and
visible on top online consumer destinations.
–          Keyword identification: Top keywords and phrases are highlighted to identify the terms that differentiate the business and act as an alert to any customer service issues.
–          Competitive marketing analysis: Compare a business to other local businesses to analyze how its reputation and marketing efforts stack up.
–          Ability to engage: Share positive news and reviews with customers and employees through email, Twitter, Facebook, Digg or other sources.
“Local search is a solved consumer problem but it’s not yet a solved SMB problem. By applying our local search technology in an innovative way, we can consistently deliver an aggregated, intelligent view to an SMB of how it is viewed by local consumers,” said Pete Christothoulou, COO, Marchex. “Our Reputation Management product is the most simple, comprehensive and effective way for SMBs to manage and take action on their reputation.  We are providing them a huge information advantage while saving them valuable time from searching multiple Web sites to see what consumers are saying about them or checking every search engine or directory to ensure that their business listings are in every appropriate place.”
Complement to Marchex Products
Marchex Reputation Management is the first major extension of the Marchex Connect suite of SMB marketing products, expanding the Marchex Connect footprint from full service search engine marketing (SEM) provider to full service SEM complemented by sentiment analytics.
Pricing and Availability
Marchex Reputation Management will be available to a limited number of local businesses during the beta period, which will conclude in Q1 2010. Businesses interested in learning more about Marchex Reputation Management, or trying out the product as part of the beta program can visit: www.marchex.com/repmanagement   .
Once the beta period has concluded, Marchex will offer this product through select Marchex Connect reseller partners who typically have large installed bases of SMB end customers.  Pricing to SMBs will be a subscription-based model and will vary depending on how the product is bundled with other offerings.

A down and dirty simple explanation could help us turn more clients onto the service. Recommendations to others considering the productThis is a great way to improve and understand what is happening with your marketing and sales team. You can not only evaluate what tactics are driving leads but how your sales team is closing the deal. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We use this service primarily to understand what leads are converting and how. We are able to see the full picture of how our marketing efforts are doing and what are the final costs per conversion.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernKevin S.Review SourceKevin S.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceUsage is key to ad sales and Marchex is key to showing usage!Updated On April 11, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?The flexibility, reporting and analytics all come together with Marchex Call Tracking!  I have employed the services of Marchex in the last three companies to track, measure and prove usage in various advertising formats.  We have also sued the Marchex Tracking Numbers to measure responses to our own advertising.  The reports are detailed, visual and simple to understand.What do you dislike?Many report options but no way I can see to template a report for quick access.Recommendations to others considering the productI tried many, always come back to Marchex!  Best value, reports, options and reliability!  The ability to show the DNA of every call to a customer not only elimiantes any question of performance of the ad, it sets us up as reliable and provable providers of advertising!  Providing analytics for a digital advertising placement is great, everyone can do that.  But providing the actual call DNA including a recording of the actual call knocks it out of the park!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Proving usage of both print and digital advertising with detail and third party credibility gives us an edge that dominates our competition!Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernAre you a current user of Marchex?YesNoWhat Inbound Call Tracking solution do you use?CallRailCallTrackingMetricsDialogTechInvocaNinjaCatCall BoxActiveDEMANDConvirza (formerly LogMyCalls)RetreaverCallFireRingDNATelmetricsI don't use Inbound Call Tracking softwareThanks for letting us know!Jordan F.Review SourceJordan F.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceSolid Services + Measurable Results = More Profit for My AgencyUpdated On April  5, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?The ability to clearly show a client what is working and provide them an ROI/cost of acquisition per channel. What do you dislike?Nothing. The customer service is stellar and easy to understand. Recommendations to others considering the productIf you need a simple, proven way to substantiate your marketing efforts are working on behalf of the service-oriented or direct response client, I can think of no better way than Marchex's phone tracking. We also use it to evaluate calls and do training to improve conversions. Many times a CEO or company manager is very surprised to listen to how his or her call center or call receivers are handling calls. Of course, if the call is answered in a great fashion, it gives him or her the opportunity to celebrate the employee!What business problems are you solving with the product?

Every time I have a question or concern, the representatives are always courteous and eager to help. I also like the ability to add clients as users.  I find the call recording feature to be particularly useful with my ecommerce clients to track offline conversion value.What do you dislike?The UI is a little clunky. Also, in the call logs, the setting time in the reports is a little tedious. I also find setting up rewrites to be less than intuitive. There are a lot of steps. Finally, setting business hours should have some cascading options.  Recommendations to others considering the productIf it's possible to make code implementation easier, that would help. I have found several times that the number changer doesn't play nice with Google Tag Manager. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We are a step closer to proving offline value to our clients. The benefits of call tracking through Marchex help me prove to clients the value our paid search efforts are having beyond tracking conversions.

They're respond to emails within a few hours and can always get someone on the phone right away, if needed, to answer a quick question about a feature, look into an issue, or get a phone number ordered. What do you dislike?I've occasionally have had a problem for a client (based around the connection time for a call to connect to their office phone) that has not been resolved. All arrows point to Marchex but a solution has yet to be found. They've checked multiple times for me and have seen nothing wrong. Recommendations to others considering the productGive Marchex a try! It's a great program with great customer service to help you out any way they can. The only thing I'd be weary of is using the whisper files as we've had multiple issues with them over several different clients.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?I'm able to give my clients tangible results with the exact number of calls coming in through specific tracking numbers. Marchex has great reporting features that show days of the week and times the calls are coming in. I can also show my clients the number of calls NOT being answered and the potential business they're losing. VERY helpful tool for our company.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernGerry G.Review SourceGerry G.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceTracking Lets Us Document Our ResultsUpdated On November 17, 2015Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?At Advice Company and AdviceCo Ventures Company we like to do more than just deliver the results we promise -- we like to be able to demonstrate that we do.  Marchex allows us to do just that and document how many phone calls a listing on our AttorneyPages.com and ExpertPages.com sites generate, and thus create irrefutable proof of effectiveness. What do you dislike?Nothing good comes free, and there is a cost to using Marchex. The only difficulty we sometimes run into is when a client changes his or her phone number on our system, without notifying us so that we can redirect the Marchex Toll Free Line to the client's new number.What business problems are you solving with the product?
