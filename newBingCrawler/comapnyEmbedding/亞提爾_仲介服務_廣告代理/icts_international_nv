Subsidiaries[edit]
The main subsidiaries of ICTS International include the I-SEC international Security Group, Huntleigh USA and AU10TIX.[6]
I-SEC specializes in the provision of advanced aviation security services worldwide, which include security consulting and security handling: security profiling, checkpoint screening, hold baggage screening ("HBS"), X-ray operator training and integrated services. I-SEC's management and key personnel are developers of pioneering aviation concepts, methods and technologies, focusing primarily on high-risk environments. I-SEC has operations in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Japan and Russia.[2][9] I-SEC was established in 2005 as the aviation security arm of the ICTS International.[10] PI (Procheck International) is a subsidiary of I-SEC.[11]
Huntleigh USA provides airport ground services in the USA. Such services include charter flight and cargo security screening, aircraft search, guard services, airlines' agents, queue monitors, aircraft cleaning, ramp and below-the-wing services, skycap, wheelchair attendants, baggage handling, etc.[8][9]
AU10TIX offers a front-end solution meeting the security and regulatory compliance requirements of the financial services sector, including Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act. AU10TIX's front-end solution incorporates unique features, such as dynamic questionnaire, developed on the basis of ICTS's experience in detection of suspicious signs and in advanced document checks.[7][12]
Products and services[edit]
ICTS has used the security system employed in Israel, whereby passengers are profiled to assess the degree to which they pose a potential threat on the basis of a number of indicators, including age, name, origin and behavior during questioning. In the late 1990s, the firm also developed a product system based on a computerized algorithm called APS (Advanced Passenger Screening) which analyzes passenger information procured by airline companies and determines the potential risks posed by a given passenger.[1][2] APS is used by most of the large airlines in the United States.[2]
Another ICTS International product is Integrated Passenger Processing Solutions or IP@SS, a system that accelerates passenger flow while enhancing security. Automated TravelDoc is a system which performs automatic scans of travel documents to verify their authenticity and ensure they meet the requirements of the destination country. Another product is APIS Solution, a scanner that extracts data required by U.S. Customs automatically. ICTS International also produces a computer-based training system for X-ray operators that simulates potential workday situations.[1]
Executive Officers[edit]
Executive Officers of ICTS International include Menachem J. Atzmon (Chairman of the Supervisory Board since 2004), Ran Langer (Managing Director since 2004), and Alon Raich (CFO since 2008).[9] Atzmon holds controlling shares, owning more than 60% of ICTS International through a family trust.[2][8]

Tata Consultancy Services Teams With I-SEC Technologies to Enable Star Alliance to Launch First Ever Automatic Document Checking Solution   Automatic document checking solution simplifies the complex task of verifying travel documentation requirements for airline passengers   MUMBAI, India, Sept 22, 2008 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), (BSE: TCS.BO, NSE: TCS.NS), a leading global IT services and business solutions firm, and I-SEC Technologies, a fully owned subsidiary of ICTS International N.V., a world leader in aviation security, today announced through their partnership with Star Alliance, a global airline alliance, the launch of its premier alliance product for automatic document checking, aimed at simplifying the complex task of verifying travel documentation requirements for travelers.  The development of this automatic document checking software is a Star Alliance joint initiative involving experts from eleven of its member carriers. TCS designed the overall solution and managed the prestigious program for Star Alliance, while I-SEC Technologies maintains the systems' rule engine database and assisted in designing its concept.   "The automatic document checking solution helps carriers to significantly expedite check-in processes," said Lee Hock Lye, Vice President, Products and Services, Star Alliance. "As airline costs continue to rise, carriers need solutions that reduce cost, improve travel efficiency and boost customer satisfaction; automatic document checking does just this."   Automatic document checking has already been implemented at one leading Star Alliance member carrier. Additional Star Alliance member carriers are presently working on future implementation schedules. This state-of-the-art solution will reduce the time for passenger check-in and help airlines avoid immigration fines.   S. Sukanya, Global Head, Travel, Transportation & Hospitality Industry Solution Unit, said, "We are proud to partner with Star Alliance in this initiative. In 2005, we helped Star become the first global alliance to allow inter-airline upgrades across its carriers. TCS is now continuing its pioneering partnership to deliver an innovative, cutting edge automatic document checking solution that reduces airline costs and improves traveler satisfaction."   The automatic document checking solution shortens airport check-in time, especially for international travelers. The automatic document checking software evaluates the passengers' travel documents and provides clear Yes, No or Conditional decisions on whether the passengers' travel documents will allow them to continue to their intended destination. The system also provides travel warnings and restrictions associated with the rules of the country they are traveling to, in a clear, easy to understand format. The system helps expand the scope of off-airport check-in initiatives, as it can be extended to airlines' check-in systems on the Internet and at self-service kiosks.   Menachem J. Atzmon, the chairman of ICTS stated, "The launch of the automatic document checking solution is an important milestone in the journey of I-SEC delivering world-class aviation security solutions. We are proud to partner with TCS to deliver this solution for Star Alliance which reduces carrier cost while improving travel and time efficiency and time for all."   About Star Alliance   The Star Alliance network was established in 1997 as the first truly global airline alliance to offer customers worldwide reach and a smooth travel experience. Star Alliance received the Air Transport World Market Leadership Award in 2008 and was voted Best Airline Alliance by Business Traveler Magazine in 2003, 2006 and 2007 and by Skytrax in 2003, 2005 and 2007.

Swissport and ICTS International unveil a new and more efficient airport security system: "Secure Check"
 Zurich/Vancouver, November 2, 2004   Swissport International and ICTS International N.V. have devised an innovative concept for a new ground services system, which will both enhance aviation security and substantially reduce waiting times at check-in and for document checks. Pilot trials will commence at Zurich Airport in December 2004. 
  
			Swissport, a world leader in the provision of ground handling services, has perceived an urgent need to accelerate specific passenger processing transactions, while enhancing the level of security, forming the basis of the new concept. "Secure Check" meets the above needs by incorporating and integrating advanced technological tools such as ICTSs proprietary APS (Advanced Passenger Screening), a sophisticated rule engine, utilized by major carriers since 1997. Swissport and ICTS International's subsidiary, ICTS Technologies, have jointly developed this new concept, which is based on ICTS's proven technological capabilities and on Swissport's broad expertise in efficient ground handling operations. 
			"Secure Check" utilizes an integrated security solution that extracts the passengers personal and travel details at the check-in, using a Smart Document Reader; takes the passenger's biometric reading in an improved, short process; and stores this information on a smart card for transfer between all security checkpoints, while protecting confidentiality throughout the process. The passenger will be required to present travel documents only once, and will undergo biometric identity verification at the gate before boarding. 
  
			The new approach will eliminate the time-consuming multiple checks of boarding cards and passports on the way to the gate, will render the security check process more efficient and smoothen the passenger's progress from check-in to gate.  "Secure Check", introduced at this years AVSEC international aviation security conference, will now be tested on selected Swiss International Air Lines flights departing from Zurich Airport from December 2004 onwards, in full cooperation with Swissport's subsidiary, Checkport. Following the pilot trial, Swissport intends to launch "Secure Check" globally. Checkport will also play a central role in the assimilation of "Secure Check" at Swissport's 170 stations around the world. This innovative and forward-looking system will also be offered to other interested airports and airlines.  
  
  
 Swissport (22000 personnel) provides ground handling services to over 70 million passengers and three million tonnes of cargo a year on behalf of some 600 corporate clients. Swissport is active at 170 airports in 34 countries. Checkport currently performs airport security duties for over 40 Airlines and employs some 400 specialist personnel. The company was acquired by Swissport International from Protectas Aviation Security in February 2004, with the aim of further developing global airline security practices/procedures in this growing security market.   
  
 ICTS Technologies, a fully owned subsidiary of ICTS International N.V., develops and markets unique integrated technological solutions and unique technological products for the homeland security market, including the transportation industry (aviation, maritime, railroads), border control, prisons smart access control and advanced documentation checks - including forgery detection. ICTS Technologies' products fully comply with regulator requirements, and are designed for mass-use environments. They have proven their effectiveness in the USA, Europe, South America and Africa.
