Vela Technologies plc
("Vela" or the "Company")
Update on investment in Revolve Performance Limited
 
The Board of Vela Technologies plc (AIM: VELA), the investing company focused on early-stage and pre-IPO disruptive technology investments, announces that Revolve Performance Limited ("Revolve"), one of Vela's portfolio companies, has provided the board of Vela with an update on Revolve's recent trading performance. In June 2015 Vela invested £50,000 in Revolve and holds a minority interest in the share capital of Revolve.
In the eight months to 30th August 2015, Revolve's trading was broadly in line with budget, with lower sales offset by higher gross margins and lower overheads. EBITDA was also above budget. The Mountune Performance US business showed strong growth in line with the forecast, whilst the Mountune Performance UK and Revolve product development divisions fell short of the budgeted revenues. The Board of Vela has been informed by Revolve that, for the full year to 31st December 2015, management expect EBITDA to be in line with the Revolve's forecasts, with the early outperformance offset by lower final quarter sales in the Revolve divisions.
Mountune Performance US sales have grown in line with their forecasts, with July's sales at a record level of £100,000. There has been a significant uplift in orders from Ford dealerships, helped by a marketing initiative from Ford Performance. Ford distributors in Asia and Australia have also recently ordered Mountune products for the first time. Discussions continue with Mazda and Honda in the US with regards to potential significant motor sport and road car projects. 
Mountune Performance UK is performing in line with the prior year. The expected growth did not occur due to a delay in the approval of a Mountune Focus ST upgrade by Ford, stock shortages for some products sourced from the Far East, and the delay of a limited edition Ford Focus programme to 2016. Management expect growth to resume in 2016, with the introduction of new product ranges for Ford RS and Mustang cars.
Gross margin was above Revolve's forecast due to a positive sales mix in the Revolve product development division as well as higher margin programmes in the Mountune Racing division. Overheads are lower than forecast due to lower employment costs in the US, which will increase to forecast levels as staff are recruited before the year end.
Mountune US will shortly be moving to larger premises, enabling it to cope with the planned increase in stock and a broader product range, which will also shortly include the new Ford Mustang and Ford RS ranges just as in the UK. Consideration is being given to opening a satellite office in Detroit in order to have resources near to the Ford headquarters.
Antony Laiker, Executive Director of Vela, made the following statement in respect of this update:
"Revolve was already a well-established business with experienced industry management prior to our investment. The excitement for Vela lies in the potential growth of the Mountune business over the coming years, particularly in the US. We wish the team all the best as they manage this exciting growth business."
The Board of Vela will announce further updates on the investment in Revolve at the appropriate time.

Update on investment in BTL Group Ltd.
The Board of Vela (AIM: VELA), the investing company focused on early-stage and pre-IPO disruptive technology investments, would like to update shareholders on progress at BTL Group Ltd. ("BTL"), a technology company based in Vancouver, Canada, focused on developing blockchain technologies to disrupt and transform existing industries. BTL announced on 16 February 2016 that it had, on that day, entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Xapcash Technologies Inc.. 
Vela currently holds 700,000 shares in BTL representing a c. 5% equity interest in the fully diluted issued share capital of BTL, which is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
Extracts from the BTL announcement are copied below.
'VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Feb. 16, 2016) - BTL GROUP LTD. (TSX VENTURE:BTL) ("BTL" or the "Corporation") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of intent dated effective February 16, 2016 ("LOI") with Xapcash Technologies Inc. ("Xapcash") to complete a business combination, whereby BTL has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Xapcash (the "Transaction"). BTL and Xapcash are working together on new blockchain based remittance products utilizing Xapcash's front-end remittance product and BTL's back-end remittance platform (Interbit) to transmit funds globally, efficiently and at significantly reduced costs to users. Of particular importance to the Transaction and the launch of BTL's blockchain remittance solution is the money service business (MSB) registration that Xapcash has obtained in Canada.
"This year is of strategic importance to BTL as we aim to penetrate the global remittance market with our blockchain solutions and start building revenues and margin," commented Guy Halford-Thompson, CEO of BTL. "The addition of Xapcash, and its management and blockchain expertise advances this strategy."
"This merger with BTL ensures a successful launch of a joint remittance solution and pave the way for more innovative Xapcash/BTL products in the future," said Jackson Warren, Xapcash founder and CEO. "Furthermore, the partnership significantly expands what is already considerable blockchain expertise among the management of BTL, and I am excited to become a shareholder of BTL."
BTL will issue additional press releases related to the Transaction, its blockchain remittance solution and related sales and marketing objectives and other material information, as it becomes available.
The Transaction
The LOI is to be superseded by a definitive agreement ("Definitive Agreement") to be signed on or before March 4, 2016 (or such other date as is agreed by the parties). BTL proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Xapcash pursuant to the terms of the Definitive Agreement, in exchange for 220,000 common shares of BTL. Given that the last closing price of the common shares of BTL prior to the issuance of this press release was $0.67 per share, aggregate consideration payable pursuant to the Transaction is deemed to be $147,400. 
The Transaction is not a non-arm's length transaction for the purposes of the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange ("Exchange").
The Transaction is conditional upon, among other things: (i) the parties entering into a Definitive Agreement in respect to the Transaction and any collateral issues or matters on or before March 4, 2016; and (ii) the parties receiving all requisite regulatory approval, including the approval of the Exchange, and any third party approvals and authorizations.'
About BTL

Technology is developed in-house and through BTL's incubator and accelerator programs, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. BTL's first technology platform is a remittance business called Interbit with a focus on leveraging blockchain technology to create rapid and cost effective "cash-in cash-out" settlement solutions from Canada and the United Kingdom to target countries

Antony Laiker, Executive Director of Vela, made the following statement:
"We are delighted that so soon after our investment, BTL is demonstrating once again how it is starting to put the pieces of the jigsaw together. This transaction brings together the front-end product offered by Xapcash and Interbit, BTL's back-end remittance platform. We hope to see more exciting news from this collaboration in the future."

  BTL Group Advances 2017 Blockchain Strategy Around Interbit Platform 

  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA and LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - May 2, 2017) - BTL GROUP LTD. (TSX VENTURE:BTL) ("BTL") is pleased to provide a progress update and strategic outline for the rollout of Interbit, its proprietary private blockchain technology platform, in a Beta version during the upcoming third quarter of this fiscal year. 

  "We are very proud of what we've achieved at BTL to date, which includes getting our Interbit platform to the Alpha state, along with funding in place to support development of the next phase. Having successfully completed pilot projects in the energy sector, and the finance space with Visa, we are more confident in our blockchain technology than we've ever been and have a more transparent roadmap for Interbit's route to market," said Guy Halford-Thompson, BTL's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. "We have built the Interbit platform specifically with enterprise in mind to help companies overcome many of the challenges they face today such as the high cost of maintaining legacy IT frameworks, speed of data transfer, data loss, reconciliation and cybersecurity," he continued. 

  Following on from the success of pilot projects in 2016, BTL has been able to set a clear strategy for the 2017 financial and calendar year. In Q3 2017, which starts in July, BTL plans to accelerate Interbit's go to market strategy by launching a Beta version of the platform, and shifting the focus onto enabling key clients to build their own applications on Interbit directly. 

  "We believe that enabling key clients to build on Interbit will create a growing pipeline of new business for BTL. Having successfully raised CAD$3,105,000 during our latest fundraise completed in April 2017, we have the ability to ramp up our technical resources and expand our teams in both Canada and the UK. By adding the right people to our highly experienced blockchain technology team, our aim is that BTL and our Interbit platform will become a leading technology solutions provider," added Guy Halford-Thompson. 

  During 2016, BTL's highlights have been the successful completion of pilot projects with major global enterprises in both the finance and energy spaces. In these pilot projects, BTL has used its Interbit platform to demonstrate how it can use innovative processes to vastly reduce the complexity of transactional IT infrastructure, thus reducing risk and costs for enterprises. 

  In January 2017, BTL successfully launched the Alpha version of Interbit to undertake a European energy pilot. With this pilot past the halfway mark, the focus is to develop the framework for a commercial product and operating model for the conclusion of the pilot. 

  Annual Financials 

  BTL also announces that it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year 31(st) December 2016, which can be found under BTL's profile on SEDAR (www.sedar.com), and which sets forth detailed operating and financial results for BTL.

This has continued into the current year, with more valuation events from within the portfolio.

In the meantime, based either on valuation events or the market value of portfolio investments, the board of Vela believes the value of the underlying portfolio is significantly higher than the value attributed by the market to Vela at this current time"

  chairman's statement 

  for the year ended 31 March 2015 

  It is with pleasure that I present the annual report to shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2015. 

  The year has been one of strong progress among most of Vela's investments notably, Portr Limited, StreamTV Networks Inc and Disruptive Tech Limited. It has also been a year of considering many potential investments that might fit with our policy of investing in businesses that, the directors believe, have the potential to disrupt the natural manner in which that business might have operated. As a result we have made two further investments recently, in 3Legs Resources towards the end of the financial year and, more recently, in Revolve Performance Limited ("Revolve Technologies"). 

  Towards the end of the financial year we raised additional funds to support further investments. As part of this Vela has a number of new shareholders who are supportive of what we are doing and understand the potential for a very significant uplift in the value of our investments in the future. 

  Since the update provided to the market in April we have invested in Revolve Perfomance. Revolve Performance is a profitable powertrain and performance engineering group that owns the leading performance parts brand, Mountune. The Mountune division, whose products are used by consumers and racing teams to enhance engine performance, has grown rapidly in the UK as well as in the US, where it was launched in 2013, with exclusive access to the Ford dealership network in both territories. 

  Summary of investment portfolio 

  The Company's investment portfolio consists of the following investments: 

  --      Portr Limited - a private UK Company that is the owner of an on-demand airport luggage transfer service, AirPortr. Portr employs leading-edge technology across its web booking platform and logistics engine in the development of convenience-orientated services for customers. 

  --      StreamTV Networks Inc. - a private US Company that has developed a technology called Ultra-D that enables the viewing of 3D media without glasses and from any angle. 

  --      Disruptive Tech Limited - a private technology investment business focusing on companies that can "disrupt" and which owns and manages investments in six technology businesses. 

  --      3Legs Resources plc (AIM: 3LEG) - AIM quoted investing Company that adopted an investment policy to invest in and/or acquire companies within the technology sector or within the resources sector where a resource can be brought into production through the application of modern technologies. 

  --      Advance Laser Imaging Limited - a private Company which uses laser scanning hardware and software applications to produce 360 degree 3D images and models. 

  --      Rosslyn Data Technologies plc (AIM: RDT) - AIM quoted Company whose cloud-based service provides a fast and efficient way for Companies to use and understand their data. 

  --      The Social Superstore Limited - a private Company developing an online social commerce platform with a view to full launch in the UK towards the end of 2015. 

  --      Imaginatik plc (AIM: IMTK) - AIM quoted Company which is the world's first full service innovation provider offering a range of technology products and consultancy. 

  At 31 March 2015, the Company had estimated cash balances of GBP156,000 (based on unaudited management accounts) reflecting the recent investments made. 

  Update on investment portfolio 

  There have been a number of significant developments within the Company's portfolio in recent months. The following summary includes a number of updates recently provided by the investee companies to the board of Vela. 

  Portr Limited ("Portr") (GBP200,000 invested, 4.4 per cent. equity interest) 

  Portr, the owner of on-demand airport luggage transfer service, AirPortr, reported an encouraging initial nine months of trading since launching its first location, London City Airport ("London City"), in the summer of 2014. 

  Since launching this new way to travel, thousands of passengers flying via London City have embraced the concept of travelling around the city without their luggage in tow, while it is delivered between their London location and the airport same day, something Portr calls "Luggage Freedom". During this period Portr can report an unblemished record with every item delivered on or before time. In addition to this the company has seen a high percentage of repeat journeys by users (20% of deliveries are repeat customers) particularly amongst frequent business travellers. In addition to this Portr's user base is more diverse than originally anticipated with stronger than expected demand from leisure travellers and London residents, when the service was originally predominantly targeting the foreign inbound business traveller market, staying in hotels. 

  Shortly after launching the Standard AirPortr delivery service, Portr announced a collaboration with British Airways in delivering a first of its kind Carousel Collection and Delivery service, enabling arriving passengers to also skip the wait at the baggage reclaim. AirPortr's mobile airport Concierges can now collect and clear passengers' luggage direct from the baggage reclaim before delivering into London within hours, an experience British Airways named 'Land & Leave'. Having been initially trialled with British Airways Executive Club on two key domestic routes the service was recently rolled out onto all domestic routes for all British Airways passengers following positive feedback, which: 

  --      helped reduce travel costs with frequent business travellers opting to use public transport when alleviated of their bags; 

   --      enabled quicker and easier travel around London, driving productivity; and 

  --      resulted in journey time savings of up to an hour, allowing passengers to either fit in another meeting or catch a later flight into London City. 

  Portr has made a Border Force policy submission in a bid to now extend this service to EU arrivals; something the Company is hoping to secure clearance for later this year, with a report having been produced by senior security and border experts endorsing the service due to its ability to enhance border integrity with the advanced technology developed and deployed by Portr. British Airways has confirmed that it plans to extend the service (Carousel Collection) to international destinations within Europe when such clearance can be obtained. 

  Following proof of concept and service delivery at London City, Portr progressed plans with two additional London airport locations for the roll out of AirPortr.  On 27 July 2015 Portr announced it was launching its service at Gatwick airport. 

  In line with Portr's expansion and rollout in larger London airports, to support a number of 'superbrand' partnerships such as British Airways and a pipeline of product development further simplifying the end-to-end passenger journey, Portr announced a GBP3 million Series A funding round at the end of 2014. Having secured the backing of existing shareholders, new angel investors and a well-known venture capital trust, Portr expects to announce completion of the round in the coming weeks giving a post-money valuation of GBP15 million. 

  StreamTV Networks Inc. ("StreamTV") ($100,000 invested by way of convertible loan note) 

  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

  September 02, 2015 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)

  StreamTV has developed a technology called Ultra-D that enables the viewing of 3D media without glasses and from any angle. As a licensing type business model, StreamTV is expected to generate positive cash flow once its licensing partners commence small sales. 

  In October 2013 Vela made a minority investment of $100,000 in StreamTV by way of a convertible loan note. The loan notes accrued interest at the rate of 12% annually until 31 December 2014 and are currently accruing interest at the rate of 13% annually. The final maturity date on the loan notes is 31 December 2015. 

  StreamTV has made a number of operational developments over recent months. New machinery to enable sophisticated gluing of the 3D optical system to the underlying 2D panel was deployed in China and is running effectively. Two automated machines, with a higher capacity and higher yields, have been ordered. The intention is for one machine to be deployed in Q2 2015 and the other in Q3 2015. The automated machines will be housed at StreamTV's large manufacturing partner's facility to establish the foundation for scaling the volume of production. 

  StreamTV has formally commenced its next round of capital raise. The capital raise is primarily earmarked for enabling cost-downs for the devices and allow more vertical business opportunities to be commenced much sooner than by way of using only operational cash flow. 

  Just as StreamTV had expected, the fact that it is are close to producing and entering the TV/display market has accelerated interest in their tablet device opportunity. The company had a tablet sample based on its 3D Ultra-D technology at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this past January. However the company has since improved that sample with even newer optics and the company is in discussions about a possible collaboration with one of the largest tablet makers globally. 

  StreamTV is also in ongoing discussions with critical component suppliers who are providing support and important product improvements. The company now engages directly with a large global chip company to provide a supply of a type of chip called an FPGA, rather than engaging with distributors, and this has reduced the order lead times. 

  StreamTV is also in discussions with a number of other partners including an Asian-based chip company that supplies chips used for TVs and who have informed StreamTV that they would seek to allow them access to their latest chips to integrate into their devices. This opportunity would help strengthen StreamTV's foothold in the TV industry and allow increased TV-type functionality than is currently experienced in the current models. 

  In summary, operations and capital efforts are all on track to establish a good foundation for manufacturing operations in China this summer and generate sales through the second half of the year. The goal for 2015 is that the Company's 2015 Ultra-D technology  creates technology awareness in each marketplace from early sales and also establishes, through its partners, a solid manufacturing base of operations so that 2016 can yield a steady and fast paced sales growth. 

  Disruptive Tech Limited ("DTL") (GBP250,000 invested, 0.63 per cent. equity interest) 

  DTL invests in technology businesses that have the potential to disrupt, typically investing alongside seasoned entrepreneurs who have been successful in their marketplaces previously. 

  Vela originally acquired 262,090 Ordinary Shares in eSeekers Limited for GBP250,000.  Following an agreed corporate restructuring, the Company ended up with an equivalent interest in DTL, a Gibraltar-based technology-focused investing Company. 

  DTL has a portfolio of 6 investments, including Nektan plc (13%), VNU Holdings (65%) and Freeformers (5%).  The normal timeframe for investments is 3 to 4 years following which DTL looks to exit an investment and dispense proceeds back to shareholders. 

  It is currently anticipated that the process of divesting of investments, which commenced with the listing of Nektan on AIM in November 2014, will continue, which could result in a significant uplift in the value of the DTL portfolio. 

  3Legs Resources plc ("3Legs") (GBP40,344 invested, 4.41 per cent. equity interest) 

  3Legs is an Isle of Man incorporated investing Company whose shares are traded on AIM. In February 2015, 3Legs completed a corporate reorganisation which included the adoption of a new investing policy to invest in and/or acquire companies within the technology sector or within the resources sector, particularly where a resource can be brought into production through the application of modern technologies. 

  Between 27 February 2015 and 25 March 2015, Vela acquired a total of 19,000,000 shares in 3Legs at an average price of 0.21 pence per share for a total consideration of GBP40,344. 

  As at the period end Vela's interest in 3Legs was valued at GBP62,700 (as referenced to 3Legs's closing mid-market share price on 31 March 2015). 

  Since the period end, on 13 May 2015, the Company acquired a further 4,500,000 shares in 3Legs at a price of 0.215 pence per share.  The Company's resultant holding in 3Legs is 23,500,000 shares, representing 5.42% of the total voting rights of 3Legs. Vela's shareholding in 3Legs has been acquired at an average price of 0.213 pence per share for a total consideration of approximately GBP50,090 

  Advance Laser Imaging Limited ("ALI") (GBP75,000 invested, 6.25 per cent. equity interest) 

  Vela made a GBP75,000 investment in ALI in September 2013, a Company which uses laser scanning hardware and software applications to produce 360 degree 3D images and models. Such images can be created for anything from small components or pieces of forensic evidence at a micron level, up to buildings, industrial plants or areas of a town and can be utilised and manipulated to view scenes from multiple perspectives at varying levels of detail, without any further scanning or photography. The 3D scenes are used in crime scene investigations and specialist techniques are used to establish anything from bullet trajectory to suspect biometric information. The technology also has a number of applications for counter terror, resilience and safer cities. 

  There are markets in both the private and public sectors including the military, property development and services, police/blue light services, architecture, insurance and legal services, both in the UK and abroad. 

  ALI raised GBP300,000 in September 2013 to launch the business and is in the process of raising additional funds to invest in further research and development into new products and applications in both core and new markets. 

  ALI won its first commercial contract in December 2013 and the company has subsequently begun to generate revenues. With the company's low cost base, ALI is currently cash flow positive as they continue to penetrate further into existing markets and open up new markets. The Company is focused on developing the forensic and counter terrorism policing market in the UK but also establishing a high value business in very specific export markets in the Middle East and the United States over the next year. 

  Rosslyn Data Technologies plc ("Rosslyn" or "RDT") (GBP130,226 invested, 0.53 per cent. equity interest) 

  The Company invested GBP100,000 in October 2013 in Rosslyn Analytics Ltd, RDT's main operating subsidiary in the UK. Rosslyn was the first of the Company's investment portfolio to achieve a flotation having floated on AIM in April 2014. Subsequent to the flotation of RDT, Vela invested a further GBP30,226 in Rosslyn and, as at the date of this announcement, Vela owns 403,368 shares in RDT. 

  RDT's cloud-based service provides a fast and efficient way for companies to use and understand their data. The Company recently announced a new major partnership in the US higher education sector. 

  The Company's holding in RDT was valued at the period end at GBP47,920 (as referenced to Rosslyn's closing mid-market share price on 31 March 2015). 

  The Social Superstore Limited ("The Social Superstore") (GBP100,000 invested, 2.5 per cent. equity interest) 

  In May 2014 Vela made an investment of GBP100,000 in the GBP1m seed funding of The Social Superstore, valuing the Social Superstore at GBP4m. 

  The Social Superstore is developing a peer to peer platform allowing users to recommend products to their friends and gain rewards for doing so and is aiming to combine online retailing with social media in a unique way. The Social Superstore continues to build its social commerce platform with a view to full launch towards the end of 2015, initially in the UK. There are a number of key user groups that have been identified and who the Company has access to. 

  The Directors of The Social Superstore continue to believe that social commerce represents a significant opportunity which has not been fully exploited by a single Company. 

  Imaginatik plc ("Imaginatik") (GBP35,000 invested, 0.67 per cent. equity interest) 

  The Company invested GBP35,000 in Imaginatik in April 2014. Imaginatik is an AIM quoted Company that provides a range of innovation solutions comprised of consultancy, enterprise software and program management to deliver innovation results to companies such as The World Bank, The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, State Farm, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, Goodyear, the Yorkshire Building Society, Pitney Bowes and Cargill. 

  Vela sold the following shares in Imaginatik; 

  14 April 2015 sold 100,000 at a price of 3.625 pence per share for a consideration of GBP3,585

  Post period end and outlook 

  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

  September 02, 2015 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)

  On 28 August 2015 the Company announced that it had conditionally raised GBP250,000 via a placing at 0.2 pence. It is the intention of the Board to invest approximately GBP175,000 of the net proceeds of the Placing to acquire an equity stake in Blockchain Tech Limited ("BTL"), a technology company incorporated in the Isle of Man. BTL, headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, is exploring applications of blockchain technology in a variety of existing industries, including money transmission, insurance, voting and smart contracts. BTL's current focus is on developing a remittance solution, Interbit, as well as providing consultancy services to firms looking to leverage blockchain technology. Interbit, based in London, is developing blockchain technology to offer remittances to up to 20 countries at competitive prices against the costs of existing remittance services. This investment is conditional on the passing of certain resolutions at the Company's upcoming general meeting and on the completion of the acquisition of BTL by Northern Aspect Resources Ltd, further details of which were previously announced by Vela.

  12 Financial instruments 

  The Company uses various financial instruments which include cash and cash equivalents and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company's operations and manage its working capital requirements. 

  The fair values of all financial instruments are considered equal to their book values. The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Company to a number of financial risks which are described in more detail overleaf.

  September 02, 2015 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)

  The main risks arising from the Company financial instruments are currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors review and agree the policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised overleaf. The Company does not have sales ledger facility on which interest is charged at a variable rate. The Directors, therefore, do not consider the Company to be exposed to material interest rate risk. 

  Currency risk 

  There was minimal exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations to 31 March 2015, and as such sensitivity analysis has not been presented. 

  Credit risk 

  This section along with the liquidity risk and capital risk management sections below also form part of the strategic report. 

  The Company's exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below:

  The Company's management considers that all of the above financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality. 

  None of the Company's financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements. 

  The Company is required to report the category of fair value measurements used in determining the value of its investments, to be disclosed by the source of its inputs, using a three-level hierarchy. There have been no transfers between Levels in the fair value hierarchy. 

  Quoted market prices in active markets - "Level 1" 

  Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  The Company has three investments classified in this category. The aggregate historic cost of the three investments is GBP199,972 and the fair value as at 31 March 2015 was GBP127,683, giving rise to a net loss of GBP72,289 charged to Other Comprehensive Income. 

  Valued using models with significant observable market parameters - "Level 2" 

  Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly.  The Company has one unquoted investment classified in this category. The historic cost of this investment is GBP200,000 and the fair value as at 31 March 2015 was GBP525,444, giving rise to a gain of GBP325,444 credited to Other Comprehensive Income. The investment was valued using the transaction price ascribed to the shares following a placing by the investee Company in February 2015. 

  Valued using models with significant unobservable market parameters - "Level 3" 

  Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset.  Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date (or market information for the inputs to any valuation models).  As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the Company considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset.  The Company has four investments that fall into this category. 

  Liquidity risk 

  The Company maintains sufficient cash to meet its liquidity requirements. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company. In addition, the Company's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.

  Capital risk management 

  The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. This is achieved by making investments commensurate with the level of risk. The Company is performing in line with the expectations of the Directors. 

  The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity. 

  The Company policy is to set the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure, i.e. equity and long-term loans. The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or loan notes, or sell assets to reduce debt. 

  13 Share-based payments 

  During the year 12,235,294 options were issued to the Directors of the Company. The options were issued in two tranches, with 8,235,294 issued on 8 April 2014 and 4,000,000 issued on 2 October 2014. The fair values of the options granted during the year were determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. The model has been applied to each issue of options incorporating the share price prevailing at the time the options were granted. 

  The model takes into account volatility rates of 74.23% at 8 April 2014 and 95.16% at 2 October 2014, which have been derived from historical experience. A weighted average risk-free interest rate of 2.0% has been applied. The share price was 1.5 pence as at 8 April 2014 and 0.325 pence as at 2 October 2014 and the exercise prices of the options were 0.85 pence and 0.325 pence at 8 April 2014 and 2 October 2014 respectively. 

  The options are not subject to any performance conditions and will lapse 7 years from the date of grant.  All share options granted during the year are equity settled. 

  The amount of remuneration expense in respect of the share options granted amounts to GBP107,000 (period ended 31 March 2014: GBPnil). 

  The inputs to the option pricing model are as follows:

LSE:VELA: Placing and proposed investment in Portr Limited

Vela Technologies plc
("Vela" or the "Company")
 
Placing to raise £220,000
Proposed investment of approximately £151,000 in Portr Limited
 
Introduction
The Board of Vela (AIM: VELA), the investing company focused on early stage and pre-IPO disruptive technology investments, announces that the Company has conditionally raised £220,000 (before expenses) through the issue of 137,500,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in the Company (the "Placing Shares") with existing shareholders and new investors at a price of 0.16 pence per Placing Share (the "Placing").  
The funds raised pursuant to the Placing will be used primarily by the Company to take advantage of a specific opportunity to further invest in one of Vela's investee companies as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes.
Specifically, the Board of Vela has agreed to invest approximately £151,343 of the net proceeds of the Placing to enable the Company to undertake a follow-on investment in Portr Limited ("Portr"), the owner of the on-demand airport luggage transfer service, AirPortr. At the current time Portr is undertaking a fundraising exercise with existing shareholders to raise £3 million (the "Portr Fundraising"). These funds will be used by Portr to finance the expedited rollout of a transformational product, which is to be integrated with a major global airline across Portr's current UK airport network at London City, Gatwick and Heathrow. The funding will provide Portr with the required capital to commercialise, integrate and build the necessary scale to support the product launch in summer 2016. 
Vela's investment represents approximately £111,343 in relation to Vela's take up of pre-emption rights in the Portr Fundraising and a further investment of £40,000. The Portr Fundraising is expected to complete by the end of March 2016. 
Vela currently has an interest in 3.4% of the issued share capital of Portr. Vela announced on 31 July 2015 that Portr had completed a £3.3 million Series A funding round which valued Vela's existing shareholding in Portr at approximately £525,000. Following completion of the Portr Fundraising, Vela is expected to have an interest in 101,989 shares in Portr representing 3.9% of the enlarged issued share capital of Portr. Vela's enlarged shareholding in Portr would be valued at £1.079 million, based on the price of the Portr Fundraising. Following the investment of £151,343 in the Portr Fundraising, Vela will have invested a total of £251,343 in cash in Portr over three funding rounds.
Background on Portr
Airportr has been building a reputation as London's airports' trusted and secure luggage transportation service, delivering same-day and on-demand, to and from the city's homes, hotels and offices for residents, visiting business travellers and tourists.
 
Launched at City Airport in May 2014, Airportr expanded into Gatwick and Heathrow during 2015. Airportr currently operates from Terminals 2, 3 and 5 at Heathrow and Gatwick South Terminal. Terminal 4 at Heathrow and Gatwick North are expected to be launching this month.
 
AirPortr can be pre-booked in advance or on the day of travel from any device. Bags are either dropped off in the airport with an AirPortr concierge, before being securely transported by an AirPortr driver to their London destination. Alternatively bags are collected from any London location and delivered to the airport at a time suitable to the customer.
The Airportr service is designed to give passengers "luggage freedom" to allow them to maximise their time in the city. Portr employs sophisticated technology across its web and mobile applications, which incorporate resource management, asset tracking and auditing and its logistics engine allocating collections and deliveries.
Based on filings at Companies House for the year ended 31 December 2014 Portr generated a loss of £785,105 and as at 31 December 2014 had net assets of £389,996.
Placing to raise £220,000
The Company has conditionally raised £220,000 (before expenses) through the issue of the 137,500,000 Placing Shares at the Placing Price with certain existing shareholders and new investors. The Placing is conditional only on admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM ("Admission"). 
The Placing price represents a 3.0 per cent. discount to the Company's closing mid-market price of 0.165 pence on 7 March 2016, being the last practicable business day prior to this announcement. The Placing Shares will represent 19.06 per cent. of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company. 
The Placing has been arranged by Smaller Company Capital Limited, broker to Vela. 
Application will be made for admission of the 137,500,000 Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM and it is anticipated that Admission will become effective and that dealings will commence in the Placing Shares at 8 a.m. on 21 March 2016. 
Following Admission the issued share capital of Vela will consist of 721,588,020 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each, each carrying the right to one vote. Following Admission the total number of voting rights in the Company will therefore be 721,588,020 and this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

Antony Laiker (Executive Director of the Company) has subscribed for 6,875,000 Placing Shares at the Placing price. Following the issue of 6,875,000 Placing Shares, Antony Laiker will be interested in 35,191,724 ordinary shares representing 4.88 per cent. of the issued share capital of Vela (as enlarged by the issue of the Placing Shares).
Related party transaction
The participation in the Placing by Antony Laiker is classified as a related party transaction in accordance with Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Brent Fitzpatrick, the independent director for the purposes of the participation by Antony Laiker in the Placing, considers, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Allenby Capital Limited, that the terms of the participation in the Placing by Antony Laiker are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.
 
Antony Laiker (Executive Director) commented on the equity placing and proposed further investment in Portr:
"As an investor in early stage technology companies it is useful and important to have a solid, supportive shareholder base that understand Vela, its investments and its strategy of investing in early stage technology companies that disrupt the way in which businesses operate.
This fundraising, whilst more dilutive than we would have liked, gives Vela the opportunity to invest further in Portr, which we understand is now experiencing very strong growth in its business following the recent agreements with Heathrow and Gatwick. Portr's model is very scalable and therefore has the potential to grow strongly from here as travelers recognise and get used to what is a shift in the way in which passengers get their luggage to and from home office or hotel and their destination at an affordable cost. Testament to this is the high percentage of repeat customers that Portr sees using the AirPortr service."
Vela's investment in Portr will be valued at £1.079 million on completion of the Portr Fundraising, compared to £525,000 at the time of the previous Portr fundraising last year, and now broadly equates to the market capitalisation of Vela as of yesterday. In addition Vela owns stakes in 8 further investments which, based on the balance sheet disclosed in our Interim Results in December 2015, will give shareholders some guidance as to the value of these investments.
The Board would therefore re-iterate previous statements that based either on valuation events or the market value or original cost of portfolio investments, the board of Vela believes the underlying value of the portfolio is significantly higher than the value attributed to Vela at this current time."
