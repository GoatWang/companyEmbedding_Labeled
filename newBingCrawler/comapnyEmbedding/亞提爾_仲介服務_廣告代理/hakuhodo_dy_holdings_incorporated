Address: Tokyo-shi Tokyo City/Area: Tokyo Country: Japan Product list: Product Advertising Category: Product Advertising Type: Services Profile: Since Its Management Integration In 2003, The Hakuhodo Dy Group Has Made Strengthening Its Earnings Base A Top Priority, And Is Undertaking Initiatives To Build Up Its Management Infrastructure And Its Earnings Creation Capabilities. In May 2007, We Formulated The Hakuhodo Dy Group Medium-term Business Plan, With Fiscal 2010 (the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2011) Constituting The Final Year Of This Plan. With This In Mind, We Are Reinforcing These Initiatives As We Progress To Stage Two Of Our Business Integration, The Next Phase For Our Profitable Growth.  In Fiscal 2007, The First Year Of The Medium-term Business Plan, Hakuhodo Dy Group Recorded A Rise In Revenue And Operating Income, Including \1,118.7 Billion In Gross Billings, And A Record-breaking \25.0 Billion In Operating Income. However, A 0.2% Decrease In Ordinary Income To \26.8 Billion As Well As The Impact Of Office Transfer Expenses For The Group's Tokyo-area Offices Limited Net Income For The Year Under Review To \10.0 Billion.  The Recording Of Revenue And Operating Income Growth Despite A Severe Environment, Demonstrates That Our Basic Strategy Of Offering Integrated Marketing Solutions Is Gaining Acceptance Among Clients. This Strategy Is Joined To Hakuhodo Dy Group's Core Concepts Of Sei-katsu-sha* Insight And Commitment To Partnership. We Believe This Strategy Is An Aspect By Which We Are Evaluated. In The Years Ahead, We Will Continue To Reinforce Our Income-generating Capabilities In The Core Advertising Sector. At The Same Time, We Will Further Bolster Our Cross-media Development Capabilities, Expand Our Business In The Internet Advertising Sector As Well As Strengthen Response Capabilities In Areas Peripheral To Advertising, As The Entire Group Strives To Reach The Medium-term Business Plan Goal Of \32.0 Billion In Operating Income.  In Addition, In Order To Consolidate Our Management Infrastructure, Each Group Company Relocated Its Tokyo-area Office, Consolidating Operations In The Akasaka District Of Tokyo In Spring 2008. This Move Is Helping To Enhance Business Efficiency, Build Closer Ties Among Employees And Company Structures That Will Foster A Sense Of Unity Within The Group, While Creating Innovation Hotspots.  As An Advertising Company, We Believe Our Role In Society Is To Bring New Meaning To The Relationship Between Products And Sei-katsu-sha, As Well As Between Corporations And Society, Thereby Invigorating The World Around Us. While Steadily Moving Toward The Objectives Of The Medium-term Business Plan, We Will Press Forward With Purpose, Aiming To Contribute To The Enrichment Of The Culture Of Daily Living.
