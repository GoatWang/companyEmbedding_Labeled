可玩性很强的，音乐很好听 (1.0.5)

Very fun concept but they clearly want money (1.0.5)
1/22/2017 10:25:00 AM
 2/5 By Tacozilla
I dont mind micro transactions or buy something and get rid of ad tactics but they use a 7-day subscription method which is renewed automatically unless you cancel it. It's impossible to get any kind of hero unless you're willing to pay. Until then, you're stuck with an ugly caveman where you get 300-500 coins a level. The next tier of heroes are 30,000 coins. So you would need to play a level at least 60 times. The highest is 50,000 so good luck getting those



Ughhh ads (1.0.5)
