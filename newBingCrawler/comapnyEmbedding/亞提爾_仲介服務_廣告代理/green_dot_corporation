1.0 out of 5 starsGreen Dot not giving refunds and nothing but a fight and headachesByBarbara Dussamanon December 6, 2013Working with this company has been a disaster.  If you can stay away from this company and go with another Pre-paid debit card, do so.  My daughter got a Green dot card to purchase a cell phone.  She loaded the card with $500, activated it and made the purchase.  She received word that her order had been canceled do to a mix up and the company was going to "release" the funds back to her card.  We were told this could take about 5 to 7 working days.  We waited for the refund and on the 10th day there was no activity on her card.  She had not received the refund.  We called Green Dot and asked about what was going on and where was the refund.  We were told they would do some investigating and call us back.  We waited and never received a phone call.  We called back and still no refund.  Green Dot stated they never received information from the company that they returned or released the funds.  We then turned around and call the company that she made the purchase with and they gave us information on when the funds were released and that if we needed any more help to let them know.  We called Green dot and gave them the information that we received, they continued to state that they never received the release of funds and would continue to investigate and call us.  Time had passed and we never heard from them and my daughter would check her card from time to time to see if the funds where there.  They never were.  We began the calls once again and were told that the release of funds had been lost and would be credited to her card, but to avoid fraud Green Dot was going to cancel her old card and issue a new one, but in the mean time to file a dispute to get the money back.  We did as instructed and waited the 7 to 10 days for a dispute resolution. They denied our claim but could not tell us why.  The reason would be stated in a letter that had been sent. We never received that letter.  We got back on the phone with Green dot and asked what was going on and why were we not getting our money.  We told them everything that had happened and what we were told by them and they denied all of the information during the conversations.  They stated that the company never contacted them and they never received documentation proving we were owed the money.  We then called the company back and they offer their help in getting this resolved.  I spend over 2 hours on the phone with the company and Green Dot and was told by Green Dot after that they did find the payment and would since we have waited so long (3 months) to get the refund and since they had all the information they need that they would put a rush on the refund process and that we would have in guaranteed no later than 4 days.  Happy with that outcome,we waited the 4 days and checked the card.  No refund.  We call Green Dot once again to find out what happened and once again they denied having a conversation the 4 days before and that the case was closed.  They denied talking to the company we made the purchase with, they denied having the documentation and denied stating they would give us a refund.  While on the phone with them I told them I was tired of being jerked around and it was time i called an attorney.  I hung up and called my attorney.  My attorney asked me to call and get some information from Green Dot.  I called Green Dot back to get that information.  When asking questions on the advise of my attorney they tell me that they have a document from the company showing they release the money and they now have  a record of the conversation where we were told the money would be credited back to the account by a certain date.  I was told they had to reopen a dispute and investigate it once more.  The account is under review as we speak and have been told we have to wait yet another 7 to 10 business days.  After three months of fighting with Green Dot and them admitting they lost the transaction and have all the necessary documents and that we have a refund coming, we still DO NOT have our money.  Please do not get a Green Dot card, find another company.  This has been a head ache and it is still not over.  They do not even deserve one star, they deserve no stars and have earned no stars....

The Green Dot symbol


The Green Dot (German: Der Grüne Punkt) is the license symbol of a European network of industry-funded systems for recycling the packaging materials of consumer goods. The logo is trademark protected worldwide.

Concept[edit]
The Green Dot was a system thought up by Klaus Töpfer, Germany's environment minister in the early 1990s.[1] The basic idea of the Green Dot is that consumers who see the logo know that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling. This can be with household waste collected by the authorities (e.g. in special bags - in Germany these are yellow), or in containers in public places such as car parks and outside supermarkets.
The system is financed by the green dot licence fee paid by the producers of the products. Fees vary by country and are based on the material used in packaging (e.g. paper, plastic, metal, wood, cardboard). Each country also has different fees for joining the scheme and ongoing fixed and variable fees. Fees also take into account the cost of collection, sorting and recycling methods.
In simple terms, the system encourages manufacturers to cut down on packaging as this saves them the cost of licence fees.

German dual system of waste collection[edit]
In 1991, the German government passed a packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take care of the recycling or disposal of any packaging material they sell. As a result of this law, German industry set up a "dual system" of waste collection, which picks up household packaging in parallel to the existing municipal waste-collection systems. This industry-funded system is operated in Germany by the Duales System Deutschland GmbH (German for "Dual System Germany Ltd") corporation, or short DSD.
DSD only collects packaging material from manufacturers who pay a license fee to DSD. DSD license fee payers can then add the Green Dot logo to their package labeling to indicate that this package should be placed into the separate yellow bags or yellow wheelie bins that will then be collected and emptied by DSD-operated waste collection vehicles and sorted (and where possible recycled) in DSD facilities.
German licence fees are calculated using the weight of packs, each material type used and the volumes of product produced per annum.
Management[edit]
Worldwide stewardship of the Green Dot logo is managed by PRO Europe (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe) on behalf of the various national Green dot organizations across Europe.
Symbol design and confusion[edit]
The design of the Green Dot symbol has obvious links with the Chinese Taijitu (yin and yang) symbol and Gary Anderson's recycling symbol. Where full-color printing is available, its official form is printed in a light and a dark shade of green (Pantone 366C and 343C). For cost reasons or to avoid a visual clash with other symbols, many manufacturers chose a black-and-white or other color combination on their packages.
The Green Dot logo merely indicates that a company has joined the Green Dot scheme, and not necessarily that the package is fully recyclable. The logo is often confused with the recycling logo.
Lawsuits[edit]
In Malta, Green Dot Malta Limited, a waste recovery company that is licensed from Der Grune Punkt Duales System Deutschland GmbH to use the Green Dot trademark in Malta, has successfully petitioned the Maltese courts on a number of occasions to protect the mark from free-riders and from competitors seeking to obtain unfair advantage from the international reputation and goodwill that it enjoys.
In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well established local supermarket based in Birkirkara, Malta, was ordered by a judge not to sell, manufacture or pack products bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly packed products. they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket.
In April 2009, following a similar request for an injunction filed by Green Dot Malta Limited, the company Zamco Caterware Limited declared in open court that it was binding itself not to circulate any products in the market with the Green Dot symbol on their packaging without the required license. The company also declared that it would not be importing any product bearing the Green Dot mark unless the relative royalty contributions have been paid and unless they prove that the imported product will be recycled in terms of applicable environmental legislation.
In September 2009, Karta Converters Limited, a company which produces and distributes articles made of paper, cardboard and plastic, was ordered by the First Hall of the Civil Court not to manufacture, pack, sell or otherwise continue circulating in the local market products bearing the trademark “Green Dot” without the necessary licenses. Presiding Judge Dr. Geoffrey Valencia accepted Green Dot Malta Limited’s assertion that the company was conducting itself as a “free-rider” in the local market and that it was taking an unjust and unfair advantage of Green Dot’s reputation without having its consent. Following this injunction, Karta Converters Limited issued a press release whereby it declared that it would be adopting the internationally recognised Green Dot symbol on its paper, carton and plastic products in accordance with the law. Karta Converters also declared that it would be joining some three hundred other companies participating in GreenPak, a waste recovery scheme operated by Green Dot Malta Limited, for the recycling of its packaging.
Out of court settlements have been reached on a number of occasions with various other Maltese companies to ensure that the international reputation of the mark is safeguarded.
In May 2010, Green Dot Malta Limited won a court case against Green.Mt Ltd, a local competitor which operates another waste recovery scheme in Malta. The latter was incorporated in 2007, a few years after Green Dot Malta Limited’s registration. Green Dot Malta Limited petitioned the Court to declare that the name Green.Mt Ltd amounted to unfair competition in terms of law since the use of the “.” coupled with the words “Green Mt” was intended to cause confusion in the market.
In delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Raymond Pace stated that the two schemes were obviously direct competitors operating in the same field of activity and that the name Green.Mt Ltd was creating confusion in terms of article 32 of Chapter 13 of the Laws of Malta. The court held that the law laid down that businesses could not use any name, mark or symbol which could create confusion with another name, mark or symbol used legally by others. The imitation did not need to be perfect. It was enough that in its entirety it could deceive a consumer. The Judge said that an examination of the words used left him in no doubt that the names could and indeed were creating confusion amongst consumers. The Court thus ordered Green.Mt Ltd to pay Green Dot Malta Limited a nominal sum by way of penalty and to destroy any offending material in its possession bearing the name Green.Mt Ltd within 30 days from date of judgment. Dr. Antoine Naudi and Dr. Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Before final judgment was delivered, Green.Mt Ltd changed its name to Green MT Ltd.

Lost in translation - What does the Green Dot symbol really represent? 






Green Dot
The Green Dot is a widely recognised symbol in many European countries. It signifies that for each piece of packaging, a financial contribution has been paid to a national packaging recovery organisation.
The Green Dot is a mandatory trade mark in some countries which means that the first person to place packaging onto the market must pay a licence fee to use the Green Dot in that country and ensure that the Green Dot is printed on their packaging. 
Who needs a Green Dot licence?
If your business is a brand owner of goods sold in the UK which have the Green Dot symbol displayed on the packaging it will be required to pay a UK licence fee. 
It is not mandatory to display the Green Dot on packaging in the UK because we use the Packaging Waste Recovery Note (PRN) system to help recover and recycle packaging waste. However, if your business exports to other European countries it may be required to display the Green Dot on packaging to demonstrate compliance. 
Many organisations choose to purchase the Green Dot licence in the UK so that they are not burdened with the time and costs of printing two different sets of packaging i.e. one set without the Green Dot for the UK and another set with the Green Dot for goods being exported.

Download our guidance on the use of the Green Dot in Europe here. 
Important: the UK Green Dot licence does not cover usage of the Green Dot in other countries. If you display the Green Dot on packaging exported to other countries you may need to pay a licence fee in each country. 
How much does the UK licence cost? A licence for use of the Green Dot in the UK is free to all members of Valpak, whereas the cost for non-Valpak members in 2017 is £295 (excluding VAT). This fee is an annual fee and is subject to change each calendar year at Valpak's discretion. If your company is a full member of Valpak’s Packaging, WEEE or Batteries compliance schemes then it can use the Green Dot symbol in the UK for free (this does not include small WEEE/Battery customers). All that we ask is that you inform us that you are using the Green Dot symbol and provide us with basic information on the types packaging the symbol is displayed on.Members of our “Small WEEE” and “Small Batteries” services, and non-member companies must purchase a licence separately. The cost in 2017 is £295 (excl. VAT); this is an annual fee, and is subject to change each calendar year at Valpak’s discretion. Valpak also offers sub-licenses to some other packaging compliance schemes.  If you are not a member of Valpak we suggest that you check with your scheme whether they have a green dot sub-license in place and, if so, under what terms and costs.
