      process of both combining and expanding our sales, marketing and back 
      office operations associated with the acquisition of CynergisTek. 
      Integration efforts have been accelerated given the increased demand we 
      are seeing from customers for complete document workflow solutions 
      inclusive of a security component,” stated Joseph J. Flynn, CEO of 
      Auxilio. “The quarter was a period of substantial investment, and that 
      trend will continue through the balance of the year given the 
      opportunity in front of us. We are already seeing the benefits of being 
      a larger entity with a national presence and we look forward to updating 
      investors on both cross-selling and sales pipeline trends in the coming 
      quarters.”
    

Financial Results for the three months ended March 31, 2017


      For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues 
      of $18.3 million, an increase of 26% when compared to $14.5 million 
      reported in the first quarter of 2016. The Company’s services revenue 
      increased approximately $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to 
      increased cybersecurity professional services as a result of the 
      CynergisTek acquisition. Equipment revenues in the first quarter were 
      $1.2 million compared to approximately $0.6 million in the first quarter 
      of 2016.
    

      Cost of revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $13.7 million, 
      compared to $12.2 million in 2016. Overall, the Company incurred 
      approximately $1.3 million in additional professional services staffing. 
      Equipment costs increased by approximately $0.6 million in 2017, 
      primarily as a result of the increase in equipment revenues from copier 
      fleet refresh activities. Offsetting this, managed document services 
      labor costs decreased by approximately $0.2 million in the first quarter 
      primarily as a result of reducing contract labor headcount. We also were 
      able to reduce service and supply costs by approximately $0.2 million in 
      the first quarter as a result of negotiating better pricing with 
      vendors. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.6 million, or 
      25% of revenues, compared to $2.3 million or 16% of revenues, for the 
      same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin is due to higher gross 
      margins from professional services delivered by CynergisTek.
    

      Operating expenses for the first quarter were $4.2 million, an increase 
      from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. Sales and marketing 
      expenses increased by 104% in the first quarter to $1.4 million due to 
      the addition of the CynergisTek’s sales and marketing teams. General and 
      administrative expenses increased 58% to $2.8 million. The increase in 
      G&A was primarily attributed to approximately $0.1 million in staffing 
      costs, $0.1 million in rent, $0.2 million in professional fees, $0.4 
      million in amortization of intangibles and $0.1 million of travel 
      expenses; most of which are directly related to the CynergisTek 
      acquisition. Operating expenses in the quarter included approximately 
      $0.3 million of non-recurring costs related to the acquisition and 
      uplisting to the NYSE MKT exchange.
    

      Operating income was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 
      2017 compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter 
      of 2016.
    

      For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company reported marginal 
      net income of $6,000, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, compared to 
      a net loss of $0.2 million, or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, in 
      the same period of 2016.
    

      Excluding $0.5 million in charges related to stock based compensation 
      and amortization of intangibles, the Company achieved adjusted income 
      from operations of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, or $0.11 
      per basic share and $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income 
      from operations, after excluding charges of $0.2 million in stock based 
      compensation and amortization of intangibles, of $0.1 million, or $0.01 
      per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.
    

      At March 31, 2017, the Company had $3.2 million of cash and cash 
      equivalents. The Company maintains a line of credit, which was recently 
      amended and increased to $5.0 million with the acquisition of 
      CynergisTek.

        	      AUXILIO Inc. Announces Conversion of Convertible Debt	          
Posted Date 08/05/14

Eliminates all material outstanding debt and increases capital
MISSION VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 04, 2014-- 
AUXILIO, Inc. (OTCQX: AUXO) ("AUXILIO" or "the Company"), the nation's leading Managed Print Services (MPS) company for the healthcare industry, today announced that its $1,550,000 secured convertible promissory note balance outstanding as of June 30, 2014 has been converted to 1,550,000 shares of common stock. Following this transaction, the Company has minimal debt outstanding.
"We continue to be appreciative of the support our debt holders and shareholders have given us over the years. These conversions re-enforce this fact and will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet as we continue to drive growth across our Managed Print Services and Information Security business lines," said Joseph Flynn, Chief Executive Officer for Auxilio.
AUXILIO closed a private offering of secured convertible promissory notes on July 29, 2011. The Company sold units consisting of a $5,000 secured convertible note ("the Note") and a warrant to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The Notes matured on July 29, 2014; accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, and were convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. The warrants expire April 29, 2016 and are exercisable to purchase up to 370,000 shares of AUXILIO's common stock. Total gross proceeds from the offering was $1,850,000.
The holders of the Notes, which includes several members of the Board at the time of the initial offering, elected to convert all of the unpaid principal into 1,850,000 shares of common stock during the term of the agreement with the bulk being converted in July, 2014. The warrants remain outstanding until their exercise or expiration.

Flynn, President and CEO commented, “We were very pleased with both the fundamental performance and the progress made with our core strategic initiatives. We continue to provide leading technology and service solutions which drive inefficiencies out of our clients’ operations, streamlining and securing their document workflow processes while guaranteeing cost savings.” Flynn continued, “The partnership we entered with HealthWare Systems during the quarter was an excellent example of how we can further leverage the Auxilio platform, providing clients with additional cutting edge solutions across the entire document workflow lifecycle. We are a trusted partner on the front lines within some of the largest health systems in the country and we will continue to seek opportunities of this nature to expand and extend those customer relationships going forward.”
CFO Paul Anthony added, “During the quarter we delivered solid services revenue growth and margins improved substantially. We are nearing completion of the implementation phase on the large contracts announced late last year and the costs associated with that process are abating, which should continue to support margins through the balance of the year.”
Financial Results for the Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reported revenues of $15.2 million, a decrease of 3% when compared to $15.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2015. The addition of $3.1 million of new recurring service revenue contracts was offset by reductions of approximately $1.8 million due to volume reductions and terminated services. Equipment revenues in the second quarter were $0.9 million compared to approximately $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Cost of revenue was $12.1 million, compared to $13.5 million in 2015. The Company incurred approximately $0.1 million in additional staffing costs, including contract labor, and approximately $0.1 million in additional service and supply costs, primarily as a result of new customers. Equipment costs decreased by approximately $1.6 million, largely as a result of the decrease in equipment revenues. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $3.1 million, or 20% of revenues, compared to $2.1 million or 14% of revenues, for the same period in 2015. The increase in gross margin is due to the maturation of previously announced large contracts.
Operating expenses for the second quarter were $2.4 million, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 10% due to decreased marketing spend when compared to the same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased 14% to $1.6 million. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is attributed to approximately $0.3 million of fees associated with the two acquisitions made in 2014 and 2015.
Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2016, was $0.6 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, in the same period of 2015. The Company achieved an adjusted income from operations of $0.9 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of 2016, compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of 2015, after excluding charges in both periods of $0.2 million related to stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reported revenues of $29.7 million, a marginal increase when compared to $29.5 million reported in the same period of 2015. The Company added approximately $5.9 million of new recurring service revenue contracts, offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in equipment revenue, compared to the same period in 2015.
Cost of revenue was $24.3 million compared to $25.2 million in 2015 representing a decrease of 4% or $0.9 million. Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was $5.4 million, or 18% of revenues, compared to $4.2 million, or 14% of revenues, for the same period in 2015.

Operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $4.8 million, a decrease of 1% from $4.9 million in the same period of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 10% due to lower compensation expense and reduced marketing spend. General and administrative expenses increased 3% to $3.4 million due to amortization expenses from the acquisition of Redspin.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.5 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, in the same period of 2015. The Company achieved an adjusted income from operations of $1.0 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to an adjusted loss from operations of $0.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, after excluding charges in both periods of $0.4 million related to stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.

The Company’s services revenue increased approximately $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to increased cybersecurity professional services as a result of the CynergisTek acquisition.

Overall, the Company incurred approximately $1.3 million in additional professional services staffing. Equipment costs increased by approximately $0.6 million in 2017, primarily as a result of the increase in equipment revenues from copier fleet refresh activities. Offsetting this, managed document services labor costs decreased by approximately $0.2 million in the first quarter primarily as a result of reducing contract labor headcount.

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.6 million, or 25% of revenues, compared to $2.3 million or 16% of revenues, for the same period in 2016.
