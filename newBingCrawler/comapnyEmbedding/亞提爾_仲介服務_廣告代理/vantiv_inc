Vantiv shares slump almost 4% after Worldpay offer
Shares of U.S. credit-card processor Vantiv Inc.  slumped almost 4% Wednesday after resuming trading following a halt for the news that it has agreed to merger terms with the U.K.'s Worldpay Group Inc.  in a deal valued at $10 billion. Worldpay and Vantiv announced the deal early Wednesday, beating out rival J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , which said shortly after that it would not be making an offer of its own. Vantiv is offering a total of 3.85 pounds in a cash and stock offer that is about 19% above Worldpay's closing price on Monday. Analysts at Stifel said in a note written before the terms were released that a deal would make strategic sense, although they were wary of it coming at too high a price. Speculation on Tuesday had placed the price at a higher range than the one agreed.  While PayPal's  name was not mentioned in any of the coverage of the deal on Tuesday, "we think it makes sense strategically and wouldn't be surprised to see PYPL enter the fray," they wrote. PayPal shares were last up 2%. Vantiv shares have gained 1.4% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.6%.

Worldpay and Vantiv reach agreement on merger terms
Worldpay Group plc  and Vantiv Inc.  said Wednesday they have reached an agreement in principle on the main terms of a merger, under which Worldpay shareholders would receive 55 pence in cash and 0.0672 new Vantiv shares for each of their Worldpay shares. The British payments processor said Tuesday it had received preliminary takeover approaches from Vantiv, a rival in the U.S., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. . Under the terms of Vantiv's offer, Worldpay shareholders would also be entitled to a cash dividend of 5 pence per share. The total value of the offer is 3.85 pounds per Worldpay share, or a premium of 18.9% over Worldpay's closing share price on July 3. Worldpay shareholders would own 41% of the combined entity on a diluted basis. "The potential merger creates a scale world class payments group in a dynamic market, with deep payments capabilities, product and vertical expertise and strong distribution channels to serve merchants around the world in the global ecommerce market, and in-store and online in the UK and US markets," the companies said in a joint statement. Vantiv shares were halted in premarket trade for the news, but have gained 5% in 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.

Vantiv shares slump almost 4% after Worldpay offer
Shares of U.S. credit-card processor Vantiv Inc.  slumped almost 4% Wednesday after resuming trading following a halt for the news that it has agreed to merger terms with the U.K.'s Worldpay Group Inc.  in a deal valued at $10 billion. Worldpay and Vantiv announced the deal early Wednesday, beating out rival J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , which said shortly after that it would not be making an offer of its own. Vantiv is offering a total of 3.85 pounds in a cash and stock offer that is about 19% above Worldpay's closing price on Monday. Analysts at Stifel said in a note written before the terms were released that a deal would make strategic sense, although they were wary of it coming at too high a price. Speculation on Tuesday had placed the price at a higher range than the one agreed.  While PayPal's  name was not mentioned in any of the coverage of the deal on Tuesday, "we think it makes sense strategically and wouldn't be surprised to see PYPL enter the fray," they wrote. PayPal shares were last up 2%. Vantiv shares have gained 1.4% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.6%.

Worldpay and Vantiv reach agreement on merger terms
Worldpay Group plc  and Vantiv Inc.  said Wednesday they have reached an agreement in principle on the main terms of a merger, under which Worldpay shareholders would receive 55 pence in cash and 0.0672 new Vantiv shares for each of their Worldpay shares. The British payments processor said Tuesday it had received preliminary takeover approaches from Vantiv, a rival in the U.S., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. . Under the terms of Vantiv's offer, Worldpay shareholders would also be entitled to a cash dividend of 5 pence per share. The total value of the offer is 3.85 pounds per Worldpay share, or a premium of 18.9% over Worldpay's closing share price on July 3. Worldpay shareholders would own 41% of the combined entity on a diluted basis. "The potential merger creates a scale world class payments group in a dynamic market, with deep payments capabilities, product and vertical expertise and strong distribution channels to serve merchants around the world in the global ecommerce market, and in-store and online in the UK and US markets," the companies said in a joint statement. Vantiv shares were halted in premarket trade for the news, but have gained 5% in 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
1 August 2017
Worldpay Group plc ("Worldpay") 
Extension of PUSU Deadline 
On 5 July 2017, Worldpay and Vantiv, Inc. ("Vantiv") announced that they had reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a potential merger of Worldpay and Vantiv. The announcement stated that in accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the UK Takeover Code, Vantiv is required to clarify its intentions by no later than 5.00pm on 1 August 2017 (the "PUSU Deadline") (or such later date as the Takeover Panel may consent to in accordance with the Code), by either announcing a firm intention to make an offer or that it does not intend to make an offer.
Positive discussions are continuing between Worldpay and Vantiv, but there can be no certainty that a firm offer will be forthcoming. 
Therefore, the Board of Worldpay has requested that the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the "Panel") extend the PUSU Deadline. In the light of this request, an extension has been granted by the Panel and, in accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, Vantiv is required, by not later than 5.00pm on 8 August 2017, either to announce a firm intention to make an offer in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or to announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. This deadline may be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code.
A further announcement will be made when appropriate. This announcement has been made with the consent of Vantiv.

Disclosure requirements of the Code
Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.
An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.
Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.
If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.
Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).
Details of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.
Publication of this Announcement
In accordance with Rule 26.1 of the Code, a copy of this announcement will be available on Worldpay's website at www.investors.worldpay.com by no later than 12 noon (London time) on the business day following the date of this announcement.

Additional Information
This announcement is being made in respect of a potential transaction involving Worldpay and Vantiv.  In connection with such transaction, Vantiv intends to file a proxy statement on Schedule 14A and other documents regarding such transaction with the SEC. Before making any voting or investment decision, investors are urged to carefully read the entire proxy statement when it becomes available and any other relevant documents filed by Vantiv with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information about Vantiv, Worldpay and the transaction. Investors and security holders are also urged to carefully review and consider Vantiv's public filings with the SEC, including but not limited to its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its proxy statements, its Current Reports on Form 8-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. When available, copies of the proxy statement will be mailed to the respective stockholders of Vantiv. When available, copies of the proxy statement also may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov.
Participants in the Solicitation
Vantiv and its directors, officers and employees may be considered participants in the solicitation of proxies from Vantiv's stockholders in respect of the potential transaction involving Worldpay and Vantiv.  Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of Vantiv's stockholders in connection with such transaction, including names, affiliations and a description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be set forth in the proxy statement and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC.  Information concerning the interests of Vantiv's participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of Vantiv's stockholders generally, is set forth in the materials filed by Vantiv with the SEC, including in the proxy statement for Vantiv's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on March 15, 2017, as supplemented by other Vantiv filings with the SEC, and will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the transaction when it becomes available.
