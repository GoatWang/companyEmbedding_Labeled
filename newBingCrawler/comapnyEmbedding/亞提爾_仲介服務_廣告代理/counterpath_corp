					Full Description



CounterPath Corporation (CounterPath), incorporated on April 18, 2003, designs, develops and sells software and services that enable enterprises and telecommunication service providers to deliver unified communications (UC) services, including voice, video, messaging and collaboration functionality, over their Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks. The Company's solutions range from software products to cloud-based services. Its software products include applications for smartphones, tablets and desktop computers, a Software Development Kit (SDK) for software developers seeking to add voice, video and messaging capabilities to their existing applications, and server-based software solutions for configuring, managing and supporting softphones and for deploying messaging and collaboration services. These software products are also available to customers in the form of cloud-based hosted services.The Company is focused on selling its software products to enterprises, telecommunication service providers and channel partners. It serves small, medium and large sized businesses; telecommunications service providers and Internet telephony service providers; channel partners, including original equipment manufacturers, value added distributors and value added resellers, serving the telecommunication market, and end users purchasing its applications directly from its online store or from third-party online stores. As of April 30, 2016, it had sold software and services to approximately 550 different customers in over 65 countries, including global financial institutions and telecommunication service providers. It has target customers of all sizes and across a range of industries, including call centers, financial services, government, retail, technology and telecommunications.SoftphonesThe Company's softphone applications support voice, video, messaging, presence and collaboration services over IP networks. It is engaged in interoperability activities with universal serial bus (USB) headset and Bluetooth device vendors to provide functionality when deployed in conjunction with CounterPath products. The Bria softphone suite enables consumers and business users to make Voice over IP (VoIP) audio and video calls, send Instant Messages and manage their presence, share their screen and collaborate with other users. The product suite works on desktop computers and laptops, smartphones and tablets, using various operating systems. For larger customers, it offers the ability to customize the softphone application by allowing its customers to include their corporate logos and branding, as well as to select specific features to be included. It has developed its Branding Portal to allow its customers to customize their applications.Bria Virtual Edition (VE) is a VoIP softphone application for the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Desk-top-as-a-Service (DaaS) markets. Bria VE software supports personal computer (PC)-over-IP (PCoIP) Zero Client. X-Lite is a VoIP softphone application that runs on desktop computers. X-Lite interoperates with enterprise and carrier infrastructure equipment from vendors. Its SDK is a product targeted at developers that are seeking to incorporate unified communications (UC) capabilities into their existing applications. Its SDK delivers voice, video and messaging capabilities for desktop, tablet and mobile devices, and can be integrated into existing customer applications.Stretto PlatformThe Stretto Platform (Stretto) is a carrier-grade software platform for enterprises and service providers. The Stretto Platform includes various modules that can be separately purchased by customers, including provisioning, user experience metrics, help desk assistant, push notification, call continuity, and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) messaging and presence. The Provisioning module enables the information technology (IT) or operations staff of an organization to deploy, provision and manage ongoing configuration upgrades to Bria softphones. The organization could control, as of April 30, 2016, over 250 settings, including default coder-decoder (codec) selection and Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal settings. The User Experience Metrics module enables the IT or operations staff of an organization to record and analyze analytics and Voice Quality Monitoring (VQM) data that summarizes service quality, device usage and feature usage.The Help Desk Assistant module enables the IT help-desk staff of an organization to directly access an end user's Bria application for trouble shooting. The Push Notification module wakes its Bria softphone applications on the end user's mobile device when an incoming call, message or voicemail is pushed from a network to the client. The Call Continuity module provides a handover of active calls between the user's various devices and can also be moved between Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) and cellular networks. The XMPP Messaging and Presence delivers messaging and presence services, including the ability to synchronize messages across all of the user's devices.Cloud SolutionsCounterPath Cloud Solutions combine the Bria Stretto client suite for desktops, smartphones, tablets and virtual desktops with CounterPath's cloud-hosted Stretto Platform. Using a hosted software as a service business model, enterprises, operators and telecommunication channel partners can deploy a system for procuring, distributing, provisioning and managing Bria Stretto clients from the cloud, as well as offering hosted messaging and collaboration solutions. Bria Stretto offers VoIP communications, delivered in an intuitive user interface, and include features, such as video calling, messaging and presence, and audio and video codecs, where available. The Stretto Platform provides customers with a system to provision, upgrade and manage Bria Stretto clients through either the Stretto Admin Web interface or an application program interface (API). Its Cloud Solutions also provide customers with access to hosted messaging and hosted collaboration services.

History[edit]
Founded in 2002 as Xten, the company was an early influencer of SIP standards through the IETF and launched their first commercial product, the X-PRO SIP softphone in 2003.[2][3] The company changed its name in 2005 to CounterPath Solutions, then again in 2007 to CounterPath Corporation. CounterPath sells and markets its products through channel partners, direct sales and its online store to businesses. Their flagship product is the Bria softphone, a client suite that offers over-the-top unified communications across fixed and mobile networks.[4] The company claims that their freeware product, X-Lite, has been downloaded by millions of users.[5] Service provider customers include AT&T, Avaya, BroadSoft, Cisco Systems, Comcast, Ericsson, GENBAND, Rogers Communications and Verizon.[6] The company also holds several patents for VoIP, FMC and Unified Communications technologies.[7]
Management[edit]
CounterPath’s executive team is led by President and CEO Donovan Jones and governed by a Board of Directors.[8] The Chairman of the Board is Terry Matthews, co-founder of Mitel. He is also the founder and Chairman of Wesley Clover, a private investment vehicle and holding company.
Acquisitions[edit]
CounterPath acquired three companies since its inception:

February 2008: BridgePort Networks [9]
August 2007: NewHeights Software [10]
February 2008: FirstHand Technologies [11]
