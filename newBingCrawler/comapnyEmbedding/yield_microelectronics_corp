Achieve fast yield ramp with UMC's product yield management service.
This effect begins with the development of UMC's advanced technologies with a Yield Enchancement Vehicle (YEV) and the use of DFM solutions. Product support including tape out review help customers identify and address potential issues quickly, In addition, UMC fast yield feedback system and FA capability can acceleate product qualification and pilot run success. Togetther with an integrated wafer sort service. customers can attain production ramp for stable manufacturing with confidence.
Three stages in product yield management service: 
Stage 1: Design and Tape-out
UMC's quality practices include the implementation of Failure Mode and Analysis (FMEA) to ensure each customer's design success. This methodology identifies key milestones to target - including tape out success, timely wafer out, and fast production ramp-up. Key deliverables and gating items are assessed through criteria that range from Design Support Manual (DSM) readiness, device performance, and IP availability to reliability and package solutions. Resources are then committed and prepared to address each element so that a complete follow-through of the plan can be executed. 
To ensure designs are built upon a robust process platform, UMC has also designed dedicated test vehicles for various process technologies. The vehicles include sophisticated VLSI designs such as RISC CPU, embedded memory, and parametric test structures. Design support for DFM and scan diagnostics implementation deliver accelerated first silicon verification and stable long-term yield. UMC also performs a complete product tape-out review based on a comprehensive checklist, which includes items such as DRC and IP sanity check to reduce tape-out uncertainty. 

Stage 2: Pilot Run Success
To achieve pilot success in a timely fashion, UMC provides a variety of Design for Diagnosis (DFD) and product functional verification services that form a systematic approach to pilot silicon verification. The capabilities include scan diagnostics, IDDQ, bitmapping, and failure analysis. UMC's system architecture knowledge enables rapid product debugging and functionality check to accelerate first silicon verification. Moreover, UMC's Fast Yield Feedback System offers real-time data feedback and test data monitoring to dramatically reduce the time to corrective action implementation.The 24-hour online Engineering Data Analysis (EDA) System links in-line measurement and CP mapping to speed yield learning and analysis. The system features web tools capable of performing customized analysis within yield results, including composition map analysis to provide yield trend charts, bin map, and bin summary.



Figure 1. UMC's Design for Diagnostic (DFD) service flow is designed for fast yield ramp, as efficient analysis of silicon data is imperative for timely product introduction.



Figure 2. Fast Yield Feedback System greatly improves cycle time for data access.

Stage 3: Production Yield Ramp
UMC has developed a powerful and efficient methodology for fast production yield ramp. Wafer sort data is uploaded in real-time to UMC's database for analysis, allowing corrective actions to be identified and implemented immediately. Customers can maximize the benefits of this continuous yield enhancement system by integrating the service with UMC's Wafer Sort Service, resulting in faster cycle time and optimized allocation of customers' engineering resources.

YMC 3.3V MTP NVM IP
Nuvoton Technology Corp. in cooperation with YMC, provides a 3.3V MTP NVM IP on 0.35um 3.3V/5V logic process that enables customers to run the process with YMC IP without additional mask and process costs. The NVM IP types YMC provides (1) EEPROM (2) Flash (3) MTP. The IP memory density ranges from 256x8 bits to 16Kx16 bits. This process has been widely used for Microcontroller (MCU) products.
 
eMemory 5V OTP NVM IP
Nuvoton Technology develops power management and high-voltage process. In 0.35um technology, it provides modular manufacturing with integrated eMemory 5V OTP NVM IP for customers in fields such as power management with embedded memory technologies.  Nuvoton also enables customers to run Nuvoton’s 0.35um BCD process with eMemory 5V OTP NVM IP without additional mask and process costs.

Nuvoton Poly e-Fuse  IP
Nuvoton Technology offers proprietary Poly Electrical Fuse (Poly e-Fuse) IP in the 0.35um BCD and 0.6um CDMOS/UHV processes. Poly e-Fuse IP is used for analog and power management IC Trimming with lower cost than   traditional PAD E-fuse solutions. Trimming using this IP may allow the customer to skip Final Test (FT) for more cost savings. Compared to Laser fuses, Nuvoton Poly e-Fuse IP saves trimming costs and enhances  yield.

  100% Fail Safe Tape Break Detection
 
The YMC Tape Break Detection System monitors the tape pad rotation relative to the main shaft. Rather than sensing the break itself, we continuously verify that the tape is unbroken each revolution resulting in 100% fail safe detection

BW701 Strand Counter
 
The machine operator sets the expected number of strands on the detector control interface. The optical sensor continuously counts the strands each revolution. If the count is less than the setting, the detection system stops the machine and alerts the operator with highly visible 30mm LED indicator lights.
