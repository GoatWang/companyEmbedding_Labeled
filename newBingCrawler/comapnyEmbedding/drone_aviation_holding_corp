RAPTOR Flight Control System
The most important UAS technology, and most difficult to master, is the vehicle autopilot and the operator interface, the Ground Control Station. Drone Aviation’s RAPTOR Flight Control System comprises the Georgia Institute of Technology’s GUST autopilot, and the DAC developed GCS. 




Autopilot

The RAPTOR on-board autopilot (GUST), executes on standard Intel i3, i5, i7, single board computing architecture. RAPTOR is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary, difficult to upgrade hardware. Being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as GPS-denied vision navigation, target recognition and neural network vehicle control. Commercially licensed exclusively to DAC, GUST is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation, on-board dynamic vehicle flight control (autopilot), and sensor-fusion navigation. GUST is mature technology with 15 years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by Georgia Tech and Drone Aviation.




Ground Control Station (GCS)

The RAPTOR GCS is unique in the industry. Developed by DAC for use in tethered systems, the GCS is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options, vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems. Further, the RAPTOR GCS operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet, PC, phone or other display and input device. This abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site, and operated with many different types of devices locally, over a secure wifi or wired Ethernet/Fiber optic link.





















Kevlar Armored Tether
The DAC tether system is an armored smart leash that provides uninterruptible power, and unhackable communications to the WATT UAS and WASP aerostat. While this concept appears simple, DAC’s proprietary tether technology is a key differentiator and enabler for long-duration, safe, unmanned flight. 
Advantages:
Tether-based systems for aerial platforms deliver a number of advantages: 
Fly more reliably and safely than free-flying unmanned aircraft
Unlimited flight duration from ground-based power
Transmit power, video and other data, vehicle control, securely through Kevlar armored tether, no signal to hack




















Tension Control Winch System
A critical part of the WATT Ground Support Equipment, the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the WATT aerial vehicle. As the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts. When in loiter or mobility modes, the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second.

Small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle. The system is fully automatic, compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions. Managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions. Further, the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle.


Advantages:

More stable vehicle flight, resulting in better video and higher accuracy station-keeping
Safer operation, especially in windy conditions or mobile operations
Winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle

Drone Aviation was formed in April 2014 from the acquisition of Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (LTAS), founded in 2009. The development of tethered drones started with LTAS in late 2009 as a potential aerostat system replacement. Drone Aviation Corp. (DAC) is focused on global agencies and organizations in the commercial, military, research and law enforcement sectors. Customers include the US Army, US Marines, US Navy, US EPA, NREL, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Ecuadorian Air Force, many US research universities and US law enforcement agencies.
Taming Altitude is Drone Aviation’s approach to unmanned systems design, manufacturing and flight operations. Combining engineering, human factors-based design, software, and safety systems to provide a reliable, easy to deploy system.
DAC’s goal is to lead the UAS industry from the equivalent of the pioneering days of manned flight, to the daily airline operations of modern times.
Drone Aviation’s technology and UAS solutions are based on manned system aeronautical engineering, and licensed pilot training and experience. Further, through our experience manufacturing and supporting systems in use by the DoD, Drone Aviation will help the industry mature for wider use in the National Air Space.

Drone Aviation Holding Corp. Provides Business Update



/EINPresswire.com/ -- Commercialization Activities Driving DoD Customer Backlog Growth

 JACKSONVILLE, FL--(Marketwired - November 15, 2016) - Drone Aviation Holding Corp. (OTCQX: DRNE) ("Drone Aviation" the "Company" or "DAC"), a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighter-than-air aerostats, today provided the following Business Update from Chairman and CEO, Jay Nussbaum.
To All of Drone Aviation's Stakeholders:
Since I became Chairman and CEO of Drone Aviation, the Company has dedicated significant resources to the development and implementation of a strategic plan based on three fundamental ideas: DAC's proprietary technology will be a significant differentiator in the market; DAC's products will address demand in the rapidly growing worldwide market for drone technology; and DAC's organization will be led by a talented and experienced management team. After completing three quarters of the year, I would like to provide you with a business update highlighting some of the results of the efforts to move Drone Aviation from primarily a product development focus towards a commercialization and revenue generation focus.
During 2016, Drone Aviation has made great progress in solidifying its competitive advantages based on its proprietary tethered drone technology as a key differentiator and in building out its aerial product platforms, including the WASP, the WATT and the recently introduced BOLT coaxial tethered helicopter. While still relatively early in our commercialization transition, it is clear that our team's hard work is beginning to pay off. For example, so far this year, we have received six U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") awards, increasing our current order backlog last month for our WATT and WASP tethered products. Earlier this year, we unveiled BOLT at the ADS Warrior Expo East, and we expect to continue to work closely with ADS, our valuable sales and distribution partner, to commercialize all of our products. DAC also intends to continue to work closely with our expanding network of partners to build our pipeline of prospective customers. We are especially proud of our numerous engineering accomplishments following multiple DoD awards to upgrade our WASP product line to further expand its capabilities as a tactical mobile aerostat.
I would like to comment briefly on some other notable developments this year:

During the first nine months of 2016, the Company generated $1,073,672 in revenue, an increase of $882,316, or 461%, from $191,356 in revenue reported in the same period in 2015. While we are pleased with this growth, it is important to note that our newest awards from the DoD, including the first sale of our WATT electric tethered drone, as well as the third in a series of WASP tactical aerostat integration awards, will be delivered in future quarters. We believe both of these DoD awards reflect early validation of the benefits and value of the Company's tethered drone technology and, importantly, will contribute to our growing backlog, which we expect to convert into revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2017.
We received a patent covering various elements of DAC's intellectual property, including the tethering system, which is a major boost to our intellectual property portfolio. We intend to continue to collaborate and work closely with the talented engineering teams and faculty at Georgia Tech Research Corporation on exclusively licensed technology, or "brains" of the drone, incorporating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and vision-based navigation systems that enable drone operations without the need to exclusively rely on GPS signals.
Anticipating entire industries and key vertical markets adopting drone technologies, Drone Aviation is working on solutions designed to extend beyond the drone hardware itself. We are engaging with partners ideally suited to add our tethered drones to their emerging Big Data analytics applications. We expect these applications to greatly benefit from our advanced sensor payloads' ability to capture and relay critical, real-time data and information, something we believe is increasingly valuable to enterprises, civilian agencies such as law enforcement and the military.
In August 2016, the FAA's landmark set of guidelines for commercial drone use entitled Small Unmanned Aircraft Regulations (Part 107) went into effect. At that time, we noted that the new rules were expected to have a positive impact for state entities exploring how to deploy drones to support first responders, as well as commercial entities seeking to expand security for large public venues and commercial facilities. This proved to be correct because interest in our mobile tethered drone technology has increased based on the ability of our tethered products to operate in full compliance with the new commercial drone regulations.
Because of my confidence in Drone Aviation, Dr. Phil Frost, the Chairman of our Strategic Advisory Board, and I purchased $3,000,000, in aggregate, in convertible promissory notes in the Company's private offering that closed in September of this year. These additional funds are already assisting the Company in meeting the growing interest in its tethered products from current and potential military and commercial customers. DAC is investing these resources intending to increase both sales and manufacturing, including building up inventory of critical, long-lead time system components.

I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Drone Aviation as we strive to implement our strategic plans and create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. Please look us up on the web at www.droneaviationcorp.com for more information or send an email to info@droneaviationcorp.com if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Jay H. NussbaumChairman and CEO

("Drone Aviation"), has delivered a follow-on order of aerial and ground-based equipment to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. This delivery is the latest of multiple military customers who continue to actively utilize the Company's mobile aerostat launcher systems as part of their ongoing operations.Drone Aviation's aerostat based BiB and WASP aerial systems are currently utilized by various Department of Defense (DoD) customers including the U.S Army Space & Missile Defense Command (SMDC), and the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO). The DoD owned WASP systems are currently involved in planning for various system integration exercises in 2015 while the BiB systems are actively deployed for troop training during rotational exercises at Folk Polk, LA. The additional aerostat based product implementation at Eglin AFB increases the capabilities of the persistent range instrumentation required by the customer for furthering weapons and platform engineering and design efforts."Eglin Air Force Base is just one of a number of Department of Defense customers that are actively deploying our aerostat platforms in support of their operations which will continue to drive our growth," stated Felicia Hess, CEO of Drone Aviation Holding Corp. "As we enter 2015, we see a number of exciting military, governmental and commercial opportunities for our unique, cost effective tethered aerial platforms and are working on new products and capabilities that we fully expect will demonstrate the true value of our technology."About Drone Aviation Holding Corp.

Provides Business UpdateMarketwiredNovember 15, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareJACKSONVILLE, FL--(Marketwired - November 15, 2016) - Drone Aviation Holding Corp. (DRNE) ("Drone Aviation" the "Company" or "DAC"), a manufacturer of tethered drones and lighter-than-air aerostats, today provided the following Business Update from Chairman and CEO, Jay Nussbaum.To All of Drone Aviation's Stakeholders:Since I became Chairman and CEO of Drone Aviation, the Company has dedicated significant resources to the development and implementation of a strategic plan based on three fundamental ideas: DAC's proprietary technology will be a significant differentiator in the market; DAC's products will address demand in the rapidly growing worldwide market for drone technology; and DAC's organization will be led by a talented and experienced management team. After completing three quarters of the year, I would like to provide you with a business update highlighting some of the results of the efforts to move Drone Aviation from primarily a product development focus towards a commercialization and revenue generation focus.During 2016, Drone Aviation has made great progress in solidifying its competitive advantages based on its proprietary tethered drone technology as a key differentiator and in building out its aerial product platforms, including the WASP, the WATT and the recently introduced BOLT coaxial tethered helicopter. While still relatively early in our commercialization transition, it is clear that our team's hard work is beginning to pay off. For example, so far this year, we have received six U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") awards, increasing our current order backlog last month for our WATT and WASP tethered products. Earlier this year, we unveiled BOLT at the ADS Warrior Expo East, and we expect to continue to work closely with ADS, our valuable sales and distribution partner, to commercialize all of our products. DAC also intends to continue to work closely with our expanding network of partners to build our pipeline of prospective customers. We are especially proud of our numerous engineering accomplishments following multiple DoD awards to upgrade our WASP product line to further expand its capabilities as a tactical mobile aerostat.I would like to comment briefly on some other notable developments this year:During the first nine months of 2016, the Company generated $1,073,672 in revenue, an increase of $882,316, or 461%, from $191,356 in revenue reported in the same period in 2015. While we are pleased with this growth, it is important to note that our newest awards from the DoD, including the first sale of our WATT electric tethered drone, as well as the third in a series of WASP tactical aerostat integration awards, will be delivered in future quarters. We believe both of these DoD awards reflect early validation of the benefits and value of the Company's tethered drone technology and, importantly, will contribute to our growing backlog, which we expect to convert into revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2017.We received a patent covering various elements of DAC's intellectual property, including the tethering system, which is a major boost to our intellectual property portfolio. We intend to continue to collaborate and work closely with the talented engineering teams and faculty at Georgia Tech Research Corporation on exclusively licensed technology, or "brains" of the drone, incorporating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and vision-based navigation systems that enable drone operations without the need to exclusively rely on GPS signals.Anticipating entire industries and key vertical markets adopting drone technologies, Drone Aviation is working on solutions designed to extend beyond the drone hardware itself. We are engaging with partners ideally suited to add our tethered drones to their emerging Big Data analytics applications. We expect these applications to greatly benefit from our advanced sensor payloads' ability to capture and relay critical, real-time data and information, something we believe is increasingly valuable to enterprises, civilian agencies such as law enforcement and the military.In August 2016, the FAA's landmark set of guidelines for commercial drone use entitled Small Unmanned Aircraft Regulations (Part 107) went into effect. At that time, we noted that the new rules were expected to have a positive impact for state entities exploring how to deploy drones to support first responders, as well as commercial entities seeking to expand security for large public venues and commercial facilities. This proved to be correct because interest in our mobile tethered drone technology has increased based on the ability of our tethered products to operate in full compliance with the new commercial drone regulations.Because of my confidence in Drone Aviation, Dr. Phil Frost, the Chairman of our Strategic Advisory Board, and I purchased $3,000,000, in aggregate, in convertible promissory notes in the Company's private offering that closed in September of this year. These additional funds are already assisting the Company in meeting the growing interest in its tethered products from current and potential military and commercial customers. DAC is investing these resources intending to increase both sales and manufacturing, including building up inventory of critical, long-lead time system components.I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Drone Aviation as we strive to implement our strategic plans and create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. Please look us up on the web at www.droneaviationcorp.com for more information or send an email to info@droneaviationcorp.com if you have any questions.Sincerely,Jay H.
