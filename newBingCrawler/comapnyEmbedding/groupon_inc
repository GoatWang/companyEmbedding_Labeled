Groupon Goods for All Your Online Shopping
Groupon is all about helping you find new experiences, and that extends to online shopping. Our collection of consumer goods is always expanding with new items to enrich your ever-changing life, whether it’s athletic apparel to wear on that upcoming 5K or cell phone accessories to outfit your newest gadget. Welcome to Groupon Goods, your source for deals on everything from cookware to pet sweaters.
Make Home Life Easier
Keeping up a household is hard work, but Groupon carries all the items you need to maintain a full, happy home. That starts with transforming every space into an extension of yourself—a task to which our For the Home section is well suited, thanks to online deals on new bedding that suits your style or outdoor furniture to turn your patio into a second living room. To keep your family happy, Groceries & Pets stocks your pantry with items such as extra coffee pods—or bulk wine, which seems to run out just as fast—as well as toys for your loyal critters. Keeping up with the kids is a race you might never win, but at least you can stay apace as kids grow. (When they’re newborns, baby care essentials keep them safe; when they’re toddlers, toys keep parents sane.) Of course, maintaining a home or car sometimes requires a little maintenance, too, in which case keep chaos at bay with a range of home improvement supplies, including major appliances.
Stay on Trend
Online shopping isn’t just for keeping up with your busy life, though—it’s also to enrich your lifestyle. Groupon keeps up with the latest trends, adding new deals every day to a selection of clothing for both men and women. Women's Fashion comprises everything from handbags to bras, whereas Men's Fashion covers both casual and business apparel. Likewise, much of our jewelry sport unisex designs—though different shoppers may have very different motives for browsing diamond jewelry . Both men’s and women’s fragrances waft through the Health & Beauty section, along with an ever-changing variety of cosmetics, haircare, skincare, and personal hygiene products.
Play Hard
No online store is complete without a reason to have fun, so Groupon gives you plenty of ways to occupy your free time. Gadgets galore fill the Electronics section, where the virtual aisles overflow with cell phones and accessories, computers and tablets, and home theater equipment. But even the biggest HDTV is nothing without entertainment to play on it,such as movies, video games, and music—though if you’re more into books and magazines, you’ll find plenty of titles from which to choose. Not all leisure time is spent on the couch, though. Sporting goods keep you active in the Great Outdoors, outfitting you with new clubs for the golf course or plenty of provisions for a camping trip in the woods. And if it’s raining out, spend a couple happy hours adding to your collection of sports cards, commemorative coins, or other collectibles.

      		Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN): Product Innovation Alive And Well But Traffic Headwinds Impacting Q1      	

            
          Published By News Desk at March 9, 2017 01:05 pm          
          

          The firm expects product innovation to emerge as a key theme for Groupon in 2H17 and 2018          

Credit Suisse hosted a meeting with Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) CFO Mike Randolfi and IR Deb Schwartz in Chicago on Wednesday. The firm’s discussions centered on a 1Q update, product innovation and 2017 marketing investments. For the stock, Groupon indicated that 1Q traffic headwinds will likely result in 1Q EBITDA headwinds, which the firm thinks will weigh on sentiment near-term.






Groupon indicated that 1Q traffic trends are volatile owing due to unspecified reasons, and 1Q EBITDA will likely be flat vs. last year. Credit Suisse’s model assumes 1Q EBITDA of $48.6mn vs. $31.3mn last year. Groupon reiterated its 2017 EBITDA outlook of $200- $240mn so the cadence of EBITDA will be more back-end loaded.
Groupon is working on several products aimed at increasing purchase frequency and reducing transaction friction (redemption and cashless payments) incl. card linked offers and Beauty Now (sub-brand for searching, scheduling and paying for health, beauty and wellness category). Both card linked offers and Beauty Now will likely be rolled out in additional cities in 2H17. Also, Credit Suisse anticipates Groupon will leverage some of the underlying technology from card linked offers in its core business in 2018 and beyond to remove friction from the payment and redemption process. The firm expects product innovation to emerge as a key theme for Groupon in 2H17 and 2018.
While Credit Suisse is positive on Groupon's strategic focus on disciplined customer acquisition, optimizing its Int'l footprint and improving shopping margins, the firm remains Neutral on Groupon shares given muted gross profit growth in 2017/2018; potential for take rate compression; looming competition from FB; and near term volatile traffic trends.

2015.09.23分享分享台灣酷朋（Groupon Taiwan）證實將在9月底退出台灣市場，消息一出喧騰台灣網路圈。事實上，這僅是這個全球最大團購業者的全球佈局之一。延伸閱讀：從Groupon看餐飲團購的美麗與哀愁，台灣業者怎麼說？酷朋（Groupon）營運長Rich Williams昨日在部落格聲明，Groupon將重整國際業務，關閉全球七個市場，終止營運的國家包括摩洛哥、巴拿馬、菲律賓、波多黎各、台灣、泰國與烏拉圭。另外，Groupon也宣布，今後一年也將裁減全球1100名員工，大多數是業務、客服部門，這將使 Gropon耗費約3500萬美元作為資遣、人事等其它費用截至去年12月，Groupon已在全球進軍 40 多個國家，全球員工約有1萬2000人。在今年八月， Groupon 已退出了希臘、土耳其市場。Rich Williams 說明，為了讓Groupon的全球版圖帶來更巨大的效益，必須把精力與金錢花在更值得的國家，因此，決定關閉較缺乏市場潛力與資金的市場。Groupon指出，完整的組織重整計劃將在 2016 年 9 月完成。所有成本的縮減將用於重新投資在公司前景上。「這是一項很艱困的任務，但我們相信經過這個過程，我們會比以前更好。」Rich Williams說。（圖說：台灣酷朋昨日證實將自9月22日起，終止在台灣地區的營運。）台灣酷朋也發佈聲明：過去數年來，酷朋在全球各地大步邁進，而我們的優先考量始終是選擇持續發展、對於酷朋整體最有利的決策。我們已評估在全球各市場的經營狀況，並仔細檢視各個不論於發展潛力及必要性投資而言均齊鼓相當的市場。經慎重考慮後，酷朋已決定於2015年9月22日停止在台灣地區之營業。我們將與廠商及客戶密切合作，以確保酷朋實現各項承諾。台灣地區之員工亦為我們關注重點，我們將致力在此時期給予員工充分支持。#裁員#Groupon#GROUPON台灣分享行銷2 從Groupon看餐飲團購的美麗與哀愁，台灣業者怎麼說？

2015.09.22分享分享昨天網路傳出團購網Groupon Taiwan將至9月底退出台灣。而今日多家媒體更證實，台北市勞動局已接獲裁員通知，目前已裁員100人，剩餘的15名員工於11月底再裁員。此消息傳出，對台灣網購界無疑投下一枚震撼彈，但業界也不乏有聲音認為，台灣網購市場餅就這麼大，多一家退出其實也不意外。圖片來源：Shutterstock究竟，團購相關產業的業者，是怎麼看待台灣網購在地化經營模式？以及台灣網購市場的未來走勢會如何發展？團購講究在地化，Groupon Taiwan撤出台灣也許非經營不善？同樣是團購網站代表的瘋狂賣客，董事長侯銘罡接受SmartM採訪指出，好的團購模式講究「在地化」。Groupon Taiwan面臨的問題也許是水土不服，由於系統、政策都追隨美國無法因地制宜。其實，第一代GROUPON經營不錯，因為掌握當時台灣網購脈動且擁有自主權，在地人懂在地經營心法，資源應用較符合市場需求。侯銘罡認為Groupon Taiwan的訊息，剛好顯示台灣消費者對團購餐廳票券的熱度已經退燒，以及台灣市場大小也許就適合維持在1~2家。觀察目前市場規模，GOMAJI 吃下8成市佔，另外17 life追隨在後，Groupon Taiwan的優勢逐漸轉淡。餐飲折扣App公司，食我創辦人兼執行長吳崟睿則認為，GOMAJI的確因為有本土團隊操作，策略明確。相較之下，Groupon Taiwan近年不斷換高層，導致策略不能連貫；組織架構無法適應。不過這可能不代表是Groupon Taiwan因獲利問題而退出台灣，吳崟睿指出，台灣市場對Groupon來說可能已經飽和，所以布局上已經非最適合的點，所以才決定撤出台灣分部。餐廳加入團購怕被定型，團購較適合短期操作餐飲團購帶來的負面效應不用多談，但為何餐飲團購的商機還能持續開拓？吳崟睿認為由於台灣餐飲環境，每年有店家被淘汰；也有新店持續開幕，所以團購網自然能持續找到新客戶。對餐廳店家而言，團購模式比較適合短期操作，能快速帶來人潮、流量及現金，但卻非店家的長期經營品牌、通路銷售策略。吳崟睿因公司性質長期跟餐飲店家接觸，他觀察餐飲業衝著折扣而來的回客率往往不到3成，所以對店家來說，做一檔團購，為了消化人數，往往花兩三個月，看似帶來人潮節省短期的行銷宣傳費用，但本質就是用行銷預算，去對換兩三個月其實沒有獲利的接單。但團購是否真的有增加潛在客戶、知名度？又或者，潛在的高機會成本、服務品質下降的風險，往往是店家與團購網交手後，才會注意到的經營細節。這也解釋，為何近一兩年店家對團購合作，開始產生防衛心態。對團購業者來說，也因為取得客戶的機會成本越來越高，或是面臨銷售天花板的處境，勢必在產品線的規劃，及價值主張需要有更創新的模式。台灣網購失去原先團購精神，新模式需要被創造侯銘罡提到，台灣人喜歡聚餐吃飯，但團購變質後，產生的消費體驗就無法成為正循環，導致消費者、店家、團購業者三輸的局勢。過去團購的本質精神，是利用贈與和行銷主題，把店內某些剩餘時段的空位賣出去，講究限時、限量，讓店內剩餘座位充分被利用，且沒有達到一定數量，訂單就不會成立。但團購模式進入台灣後，會想嘗試團購的餐飲業者本來毛利就不高，而團購網站只負責推動促銷活動，一味追求營業額成長，後續的實體服務、食材鮮度、會員經營，往往未被納入這個循環中，導致品質與價值的夾殺下，失去原先團購精神。當餐飲業者以5折售價，再給平台抽傭金25%，當營收減少75%又面臨回客率低的窘境時，這也說明了為何加入團購而倒店的餐飲業者不在少數。侯銘罡提到瘋狂賣客當時要做團購平台，就注意到餐飲業環境的惡性循環，傷害店家也傷害消費者，所以決定不做餐廳這塊，只做宅配商品，包含3C通訊周邊、生活日用、旅遊套裝行程等。而瘋狂賣客如何與其他團購經營模式做出區別？侯銘罡說最大的投資就是在自建倉庫。由於很多團購業者靠轉單，直接給供應商出貨，這就難掌握商品的品質、後端客訴等問題。所以自建倉庫不只能掌握出貨狀況，後續的客服、退貨更能掌握，這是比預購模式更能了解消費者體驗的方式。曾參加團購的店家代表Eric Wang也指出，其實 團購可以做，但店家自己一定要注意以下4點：成本率要能換算 （含閒置設備與人力的成本轉換）如何利用團購？（可以換到免費的拍照與搜索關鍵字曝光）如何創造對自己店家有利的團購組合？（利用閒置率）注意服務品質與餐點品質延伸閱讀：團購真的是爛東西嗎？四大迷思有待破除！文章來源：SmartM#瘋狂賣客#團購網#餐飲市場#GOMAJI團購網#GROUPON台灣分享行銷3 團購真的是爛東西嗎？四大迷思有待破除！

2015.09.22分享分享「如果團購真的是爛東西，那為什麼國外的 Groupon還可以活著？」網友小黑在個人臉書如此問。Groupon 的新聞這兩天沸沸揚揚，消息未待證實就已引起業界對團購網未來的廣泛討論。團購業真的這麼爛嗎？另一家團購網 Gomaji 即將上市，台灣Groupon 經營出問題，不代表整個團購產業都在走下坡。根據研究機構 Statista 的報告指出，美國 Groupon 在 2015 年第二季的營收超過美金 7 億。資金豐厚是 Groupon 的一大優勢，何以走到如此地步？團購網連接了店家和消費者，是真正的 O2O 始祖，最典型的服務就是商家提供虛擬票卷給團購網，消費者在上網選購後，於一定時間內和規定的地點，到店兌換商品或消費。商家賺到前來消費的客人，客人則獲得了價格優惠，看似雙贏的商業模式，Groupon 的問題究竟出在哪？以下，先從大家對團購網的四個迷思說起。1. 團購會倒，因為商家被抽成很高？錯！很多人覺得團購玩不下去，是因為商家被抽成很高，沒有商家願意參與。錯了。願意參與團購的商家，其實早已算好利潤及後續成本，店家的心態，其實不笨！團購成敗關鍵，首要在於「地推部隊」，也就是扎扎實實去店家推廣團購方案的業務團隊。成功的地推部隊，能為店家帶來顧客，它必須很扎實的去攻克在地商家，實打實，業務要很認真的去與在地商家洽談，才能真正為店家搭起與消費者之間的橋樑，店家看到認真的業務，常常到店裡討論桌數、翻桌率、甚至給予菜單建議，店家才會信任業務，才會持續跟團購網做生意。如果團購的地推部隊不認真，業績只靠消費者線上訂購商品、然後再用物流服務寄出（這就是業內所謂的「快遞單」），久了業務就會偷懶，坐在辦公室裡打電話就能成交，就有業績進來了，何樂不為呢？但對店家來說，團購網如果沒有為它帶來店面消費的客人，那與一般電商或網路商城有什麼兩樣！團購網沒有掌控快遞單的後果，就是讓自己從重要的 O2O「橋樑」，變成一條可有可無的「電話線」，那不倒還有道理嗎？2. 團購會倒，因為只能拼便宜？錯！團購網的優惠特性，是吸引很多消費者首次上門的主因，這絕對毋庸置疑。但是，君不見團購網天天都有下殺，天天都在破盤優惠，消費者一開始難免手滑而衝動購物，但太常做行銷活動的結果，就是讓消費者無感！天天的折扣都激不起他們的購物慾。所以，不是不能拼便宜，是便宜的行銷檔次不能常做。行銷活動，要有梗、要有話題、要有代表性，資源不能分散，不能養壞消費者胃口、還打壞店家行情！3. 團購會倒，因為顧客不回頭消費？錯！很多店家抱怨顧客使用團購後就不會再回頭消費，顧客的抱怨聲音則是使用團購的到店體驗不佳，因為店家顯然沒有掌控好團購的發放量，還把使用團購卷的顧客當二等消費者，有這種心態的店家，只會被消費者封殺！團購最大的功用，除了建立消費者與店家之間的「在地」連結，活絡在地經濟，更大的功能還可以讓當地形成完整的生活商圈。要建立商圈，團購網不能只是提供商品優惠而已。優惠只是吸引顧客上門的基本款，但團購網有沒有解決消費者的生活痛點？它有沒有提供延續的服務？比如最常見的餐卷，團購網如果可以讓顧客在線上就訂好位、出門之前先點好餐點，讓顧客除了優惠之後還能享受到便利，那才是團購網永續的經營之道。團購是非常需要「在地化」的，而能解決消費者生活痛點的在地 O2O 模式，才是團購網能走得長久的商業模式！4. 團購會倒，因為商品利潤太低？錯！回到上述所說的快遞單，如果業務都在辦公室打電話，為了業績什麼單都接，利潤當然不可能太高。如果能維持利潤率 15% 以下的單不接（除非有品牌等特殊考量），那團購會倒嗎？但這關係到在位的主事者，有沒有認真為自己的公司的單把關，若是為了衝業績而妥協亂接單，真的只會落入便宜還要再便宜的價格戰，只會把自己的公司逼到死胡同！但不知道有哪幾個主事者願意一單一單的自己審核？這麼微小的執行細節，其實都關乎公司的正向成長與否！如果一直打著華而不實的口號、玩不實際的花招，消費者真正的需求痛點卻一直沒被解決，哪怕是資源豐富如 Groupon，也只能可惜了。由此可見，主事者對訂單的品質把關與否，是決定成敗的關鍵之一！另外，團購的獲利來源，不是只有業務單，更重要的還有「廣告」！訂單和廣告兼具的 O2O 平台，才能為商家帶來更多元的行銷服務。行動時代的來臨，早可透過 LBS、手機序號等行動數據，去追蹤顧客的消費行為，在對的時間推播精準廣告給顧客，「行動廣告行銷」是團購網在行動時代的必要出路！以上四點迷思，讓台灣 Groupon 走不出自己的死胡同，GG了。團購是必須長久經營的在地事業，企業團隊不同，造就不同的行銷方向、公司決策，也導致不同的企業結局。人才，終究是關鍵！（本文作者曾任職於科技報紙及網路媒體多年）顯示圖片來源：Todd Barnard via Flickr, CC Licensed#團購網#GROUPON台灣#促銷#業務分享4 調查~超過一半的企業客戶不願再次使用Groupon

2011.07.29分享分享2008年底成立，沒多久前才風光提出IPO申請，年成長2241%史上最快的Groupon，上個月卻傳出它在幾個發源市場的數據逐步惡化，競爭對手Google Offers也已經針對它研究出獵殺計畫。那麼，商家們對於Groupon的真正想法究竟為何呢？為了解開這個謎團，美國知名科技部落格Business Insider於是針對一群實際上使用Groupon服務的公司進行調查，並得到了以下結果：超過一半的受試公司，都是6個月內才開始使用Groupon的新客戶約60%的商家認為，他們在Groupon上的交易是成功的，即也有40%覺得是失敗經驗而有超過一半的公司也表示，不會考慮繼續使用Groupon服務它們在Groupon上的方案，折扣大多落在二五折到五折之間多數商家分到的營收比例不到一半多數公司都沒有賠錢，不過賠錢商家的比例也逼近一半了變成重複購買顧客的Groupon用戶並不多，顯示Groupon並不如人們所想的是個有效獲取客戶工具多數受試商家只有和Groupon一家團購網站合作過Groupon所提供的服務經驗並沒有比競爭對手好多少有一半的公司不會向其他商家推薦使用Groupon，另外一半則是會看起來，Groupon要贏得更多商家的心，恐怕還得加把勁，而不妨就先從這幾點改革起。出自Business Insider#Groupon分享

Groupon is an American worldwide e-commerce marketplace connecting subscribers with local merchants by offering activities, travel, goods and services in more than 28 countries. Based in Chicago, Groupon was launched in November 2008, and the first market for Groupon was Chicago, followed soon thereafter by Boston, New York City and Toronto. By October 2010 Groupon was available in 150 cities in North America and 100 cities in Europe, Asia and South America, and had 35 million registered users.[3][4][5][6] By the end of March 2015, Groupon served more than 500 cities worldwide, nearly 48.1 million active customers and featured more than 425,000 active deals globally.[7]
The idea for Groupon was created by now-ousted CEO and Pittsburgh native[8] Andrew Mason.[9] The idea subsequently gained the attention of his former employer, Eric Lefkofsky, who provided $1 million in "seed money" to develop the idea. In April 2010, the company was valued at $1.35 billion.[10] According to a December 2010 report conducted by Groupon's marketing association and reported in Forbes magazine and the Wall Street Journal, Groupon was "projecting that the company is on pace to make $1 billion in sales faster than any other business, ever."[8]
In its first earnings release as a public company, Groupon reported a 2011 fourth-quarter loss of $9.8 million on an adjusted basis, disappointing investors.[11] Additional investor concern arose after the company restated 2011 revenues downward in March 2012.[12]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
The idea that would eventually become Groupon was born out of founder Andrew Mason's frustration trying to cancel a cell phone contract in 2006. Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage large number of people's collective bargaining power. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the "tipping point" principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago, until a group of users decided their cause would be saving money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying. Born from The Point, Groupon was launched in November 2008.[13][14][15]
The name Groupon is a blend of “group” and “coupon”. Groupon's first deal was a half-price offer for pizzas at Motel Bar, a restaurant on the first floor of its building in Chicago.[8][16]
The decision to focus on group buying proved wise. In just a year and a half, Groupon grew from a staff of a few dozen to over 350. Revenue and Booking also grew swiftly and the company was valued at over $1 billion after just 16 months in business, the fastest company ever to reach this milestone.[17]
Fueled by its rapid growth, Groupon went public on November 4, 2011. It was the biggest IPO by an Internet company since Google in 2004.[18]
2011 onward[edit]
Prior to the company's fifth anniversary, the Groupon website was completely redesigned and new features were added in November 2013. According to the SVP of product management, the original website was "designed for a deal of the day and the new site is designed for a marketplace." Following the website relaunch, the company rewarded a random selection of one million customers on November 20, 2013 with up to US$5,000 worth of "Groupon bucks".[19][20]
Groupon recorded record-breaking holiday weekend sales in North America during the full (Black Friday through Cyber Monday) weekend of 2014 (Nov. 28 - Dec. 21), representing the most successful four days ever in the company's six-year history, with sales up more than 25% year over year. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were the two biggest days in Groupon's North American history.[21]
Following Amazon.com's December announcement on drone delivery, Groupon reacted with a plan for "Groupon catapults".[22]
On December 29, 2014, Groupon's shares rose by 1.4% after it was reported that Goldman Sachs was "weighing an investment in one of the daily deal company’s units."[23]
Groupon named a new Chief Operating Officer on June 2, 2015, Rich Williams and in November, Williams was named CEO.[24][25]
On September 22, 2015, Groupon announced they would be eliminating approximately 1,100 positions, primarily in their sales and customer service operations.[26] As part of this restructure, they would be ceasing operations in international markets such as Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.
In January 2016, Groupon signed a lease in Seattle for 42,000 square feet of space in the 1201 3rd Avenue building in downtown. This creates room for 400 employees, up from 300 that Groupon currently employs in Washington.[27]
In May 2016, Groupon sued IBM, accusing it of infringing a patent related to technology that helps businesses solicit customers based on the customers' locations at a given moment. Groupon filed its lawsuit on May 9 with the federal court in Chicago, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[28]
In November 2016, Groupon began to reduce its area of coverage from 27 countries down to 15. It shut down operations in South Africa November 4 of that year.[29]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
Groupon owns numerous international operations, all of which were originally deal-of-the-day services similar to it, but most of which were subsequently re-branded under the Groupon name after acquisition, including the European-based MyCityDeal (May 17, 2010), the South American ClanDescuento (June 22, 2010), the Japanese service Qpod.jp and Russian Darberry.ru (both acquired on August 17, 2010),[30] and the Singaporean Beeconomic.com (November 30, 2010), which was founded by brothers Karl Chong and Christopher Chong.[31]
Groupon bought the Indian deal-of-the-day website SoSasta.com in January 2011 and re-branded it as "Crazeal by Groupon Inc."[32] The Groupon acquisitions of uBuyiBuy launched services under the Groupon name in Hong Kong.[33] In addition, Groupon acquired GroupsMore.com to expand its business in Malaysia.[34]
Prior to these acquisitions, Groupon had bought out the mobile technology company Mob.ly. The Point, Inc., the predecessor to Groupon, bought the trademark[35] "GROUP-ONS" from its originator in February 2009 under terms which allow the originator and first registrant of the trademark to continue the use of the trademark.
On August 4, 2011, the company acquired Obtiva, a large Chicago, Illinois-based Ruby on Rails and Agile Software Development consulting firm for an undisclosed amount, in order to boost its technology recruiting capabilities.[36][37]
In January 2012, the company acquired Mertado, a social shopping service based on the Facebook platform.[38] In May 2012, Groupon acquired Breadcrumb, a point of sale system and iPad app that targets local restaurants.[39] Based on the May acquisition, Groupon launched Breadcrumb PRO and Breadcrumb POS, expanding its target beyond restaurants to include all types of local businesses.[40]
On September 24, 2012, Groupon acquired restaurant reservation and discount site Savored for an undisclosed amount, providing Groupon with an inlet to higher-end restaurants. Groupon also announced that it would continue to operate Savored independently from the main Groupon website.[41]
In December 2013, Groupon acquired Boomerang, a Lightbank-backed startup that allows people to share gift cards and other deals from local merchants with their friends.[42] Boomerang's two cofounders, Zachary Smith and Matthew Williams, along with eight employees went on to build a new digital-coupon offering, called Groupon Coupons.[43]
On January 11, 2013, Groupon acquired real-time location sharing mobile app and small business service provider Glassmap, which was founded and led by Geoffrey Woo, Jon Zhang and Jonathan Chang.[44] On September 9, 2013, Groupon announced acquisition of European last-minute travel app Blink (founded by Rebeca Minguela), which provides same-day hotel reservations.[45]
On October 2, 2014, Groupon unveiled Snap, a new app specifically for giving customers cash back when they buy certain items at the grocery store. Snap asks shoppers to upload photos of their receipts after they've gone to the supermarket to buy groceries. Certain items are then eligible for discounts, which shoppers receive in the form of a cash-back deal. The new app comes from Groupon's previous acquisition of SnapSaves, a Canadian start-up that works much like Snap.[46]
In November 2014, Groupon acquired In-Store Analytics And Marketing Startup, Swarm Mobile, a startup that helps businesses connect with and track their customers while in stores.[47]
In February 2016, Chinese online retailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd disclosed that it acquired a 5.6% stake in Groupon Inc.[48]
In April 2016, Groupon Inc. announced it received a $250 million investment from a private investment firm, Atairos Management LP, which has ties to Comcast Corp. The firm was founded by former Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis, who launched the firm earlier this year with more than $4 billion in committed capital from Comcast.[49]
In late October 2016, Groupon announced that it is acquiring daily-deals provider LivingSocial.[50]
Business[edit]
Business model[edit]
When it first launched, the company offered one "Groupon" per day in each of the markets it served. The Groupon worked as an assurance contract using ThePoint's platform: if a certain number of people signed up for the offer, then the deal became available to all;[51] if the predetermined minimum was not met, no one got the deal that day.[8] This reduces risk for retailers, who can treat the coupons as quantity discounts[8] as well as sales promotion tools. In the early years before revenue splits began to adjust as necessary, Groupon made money by keeping approximately half the money the customer pays for the coupon. Currently, that split can vary depending on many factors.[8][52][53]
For example, in a 50/50 revenue split, if $240 worth of home painting services are purchased by the consumer for $50 through Groupon, then the business gets $25 and Groupon keeps $25. There are certain businesses to which Groupon initially did not offer its services, including shooting ranges and strip clubs;[54] however, shooting ranges have been featured on Groupon. [55]
Unlike classified advertising, the merchant does not pay any upfront cost to participate:[8] Consumers are able to search and browse deals via web or mobile and can subscribe to receive emails featuring deals they are interested in based on preferences they input.
Groupon employs a large number of copywriters[56] who draft descriptions for the deals featured by email and on the website. Groupon's promotional text for the deals has been seen as a contributing factor to the popularity of the site, featuring a distinctive mix of thorough fact-checking and witty humor.[56]
Groupon's customer base primarily is female and has a college education.[7]
There are potential problems with the business model. For example, a successful deal could temporarily swamp a small business with too many customers, risking a possibility that customers will be dissatisfied, or that there won't be enough product to meet the demand.[8] Gap, a large clothing retailer, was able to handle 445,000 coupons in a national deal (although it experienced server problems at one point), but a smaller business could become suddenly flooded with customers.[8] One coffee shop in Portland, Oregon struggled with an increase in customers for three months, when it sold close to 1,000 Groupons on the one day it was offered, according to one report.[57] In response to similar problems, Groupon officials state that deals sold will be capped in advance to a number that the business can service effectively.[8]
Groupon encourages new customers to try local businesses. 88% of merchants agree that their Groupon deal brought in new customers, and 82% of customers say they are likely to return to the merchant again.[7]
In a 2011 TechCrunch analysis of Groupon, writer Rakesh Agrawal predicted that, over time, Groupon's merchant customer base would contract to only those businesses that could profitably exploit its business model, such as yoga studios or other services that could offer customers long-term subscriptions not bound by the Groupon terms. When the company reported in the second quarter of 2012 that its revenues had declined along with customer growth and the amount of money existing customers spent on the site, Slate tech journalist Farhad Manjoo said Agrawal had been vindicated.[58] Agrawal's prediction, however, did not hold true as a more recent snapshot of the company shows consolidated revenue growing 24% year-over-year in 2014,[21] in conjunction with active customers reaching 48.1 million and active deals reaching more than 425,000 globally.[59]
In 2010, it was reported that local merchants found it difficult to get Groupon interested in agreeing to a particular deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, seven of every eight possible deals suggested by merchants were dismissed by Groupon.[8]
Groupon offers a mobile application available on iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone. It allows users to browse and buy deals on their phones and redeem them using the screen as a coupon. Also Groupon is now a part of several Daily Deal Aggregators, which helps them expand their target audience, gain traffic and increase sales and revenue.
In February 2011, Groupon Russia announced it would join the Russian Company Mail.ru in order to start offering deals on its social network Odnoklassniki. This way, users would be able to buy and share deals from Groupon on their profiles.
In addition to daily local deals, Groupon’s current channels are: Groupon Goods, launched in September 2011, which focuses on discounted merchandise; Groupon Getaways,[60] which offers vacation packages and travel deals; and GrouponLive,[61] where consumers can find discounts on ticketed events—concerts, sporting events, theater, etc. (About Family Vacations recommends Groupon Getaways as an essential travel dealfinding site.) [62]
Groupon has also emerged as a check on price increases for certain essential commodities in many countries. In September 2013, Groupon India announced that it would sell onions for ₹9 ($0.14) per Kg in a sharp contrast to the market price of ₹70-80 per Kg.[63]
In January 2014, Groupon bought ideeli, a fashion company, for $43 million.[64]
In April 2015, Groupon announced it is selling a controlling stake in the Korean online shopping platform, Ticket Monster, to a consortium including Anchor Equity Partners, KKR and TMON management. Groupon will continue to retain a fully diluted 41% minority stake in the company.[65]
On July 16, 2015, Groupon announced its acquisition of food-delivery service OrderUp.[66] Two weeks later, Groupon announced its own Food Delivery Business, Groupon To Go.[67]
Geographic markets[edit]
Groupon breaks into new markets by identifying successful local businesses, first by sending in advance a number of employees to research the local market; when it finds a business with outstanding reviews, salespeople approach it and explain the model, and use social marketing sites such as Facebook to further promote the idea.[8] Groupon serves 500 markets and 15 countries, the many major geographic markets internationally include cites in the United States,[68] Canada,Ukraine, Germany, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia,[69] Ireland, Israel,[70] Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Japan, Turkey, Mexico, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Russia, and South Africa. Groupon and an Australian company, Scoopon.[71] The two companies agreed on an out of court settlement by July 2012.[72]
On February 19, 2011 The Wall Street Journal reported that Groupon was preparing to launch in China.[73][74] Groupon subsequently entered into the China market in a joint venture with Tencent and launched "Gaopeng". After a year of struggling in the established market, Goapeng subsequently merged with Futuan. Groupon is also expanding into the MENA region with its launch of Groupon UAE on June 16, 2011.[75]
Groupon New Zealand launched on 10 May 2011.[citation needed]
Groupon entered the Indian market through the acquisition of local company SoSasta in Jan 2011.[76] The Indian company was renamed Crazeal in Oct 2011 and CEO Ankur Warikoo was placed at the helm.[77] Finally, after winning a battle to acquire the groupon.co.in domain name, the Indian business was renamed Groupon in Nov 2012.[78][79] Groupon India is renamed as Nearbuy from 10 August 2015.[80]
Groupon United Arab Emirates[81] launched on June 15, 2011; Groupon Denmark[82] launched on September 21, 2011; and Groupon Thailand[83] launched on February 27, 2012.
In August 2015, Groupon gave up control of its India unit to Sequoia Capital, the Menlo Park-based venture capital firm. Groupon India is now known as Nearbuy and has a new website and mobile app[84]
In November 2015, Groupon announced it is shutting down business in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Groupon also recently closed in countries including Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay.[85]
Competitors[edit]
Direct[edit]
Worldwide, there are over 500 sites similar to Groupon, including over 100 in the United States.[8][10] However, by December 2010, only one competitor, LivingSocial, had been described as a serious competitor; they used the same business model- Transaction fee model; according to one estimate, it received an investment from Amazon of $175 million.[8] Other notable firms that operate to provide consumer deals include, Plum district, Jasmere.com, Ebates, FatWallet, RetailMeNot, meerkatmall.com, chi-spree.com and NetBarg the first group buying platform in Iran.[86][87]
In 2011, after reports surfaced on the subject,[88] Google launched a competing product, called Google Offers, following its failure to purchase Groupon for $6 billion.[89]
In April 2011, Facebook began testing a social-buying program.[90] This move was speculated to be a competitive threat to Groupon, but Facebook ended the project by August 2011.[91]
In October 2011, Adlibrium announced Adlibrium Dailies, the first free daily deal service for merchants which, according to estimates, reaches nearly 4 million consumers via email and mobile combined.[92]
The growth of Groupon buying also created an increase of "deal comparison websites" such as Amazon Local. Amazon announced it was closing down Amazon Local in November 2015.[93]
As of December 2015, Chinese startup unicorn Meituan is the largest player in the daily deals space. Its recent valuation is approximately $7 billion.[94]
Indirect[edit]
As Groupon looks to expand beyond daily deals to become a marketplace for local commerce, the company comes into competition with many large players. Groupon Goods competes with Amazon. Facebook is testing "Local Market", a buying and selling community powered by Facebook groups, that also indirectly competes with Groupon. "Local" is a hard nut to crack, and while many players seek to find a foothold in the space, Groupon continues to have a significant advantage because of its relationships with 150,000 local businesses in the United States alone.[95]
Financials[edit]
New Enterprise Associates, Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell are investors in Groupon (Lefkofsky and Keywell later formed the investment company Lightbank; Groupon is listed as a Lightbank investment).[96] In April 2010, Groupon raised $135 million from Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm.[97] On December 29, 2010, Groupon's executive board approved a change to Groupon's certificate of incorporation that would permit the company to raise $950 million in venture capital funding, based on a valuation of $6.4 billion.[98] On June 2, 2011, Groupon filed to go public under the ticker symbol GRPN. The IPO was handled by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse Group.
From January 2010 through January 2011, Groupon’s U.S. monthly revenues grew from $11 million to $89 million. Consolidated revenue for the full year 2014 reached nearly $3.2 billion.[21]
In October 2010, Yahoo! was rumored to have offered over $3 billion to acquire Groupon.[99] On November 30, 2010, it was reported that Google offered $5.3 billion with a $700 million earnout to acquire Groupon and was rejected on December 3, 2010.[100] After the rejection of the Google/Groupon buy-out, Groupon proceeded with their own initial public offering.
Groupon’s consolidated gross billings for the full year 2014 increased 32% year-over-year to $7.6 billion.[21]
In early November 2012, Groupon reported they had missed their third quarter revenue estimates, posting a revenue of $586.6 million while estimates were at $591 million. This caused Groupon's stocks to fall to as low as $2.93/share early in the trading day. Groupon has said to have lost 80% of its value since its initial public offering over one year ago.[101] The stock has since rebounded and was trading around $8 in Q1 2015 before plunging as low as $2.15 in early 2016.[102]
Groupon Now application[edit]
In 2011, Groupon developed an application, Groupon Now, aimed at smartphone and tablet users. The application consists of two buttons: "I'm Hungry" and "I'm Bored.” Once a user clicks on one of the buttons, the app then locates the closest and best deals for food or entertainment, respectively, using geolocation.[103]
Groupon Promise[edit]
Groupon have the Groupon Promise to ensure that customers are satisfied with their purchase and if customers are disappointed with their purchase, Groupon will try to work things out with the customers or give them a refund.[104]
Groupon VIP[edit]
On February 20, 2012, Groupon announced a "VIP Membership" program, with a membership fee of $30 annually.[105] This program gives VIP members access to deals 12 hours earlier than non-members, as well as access to expired deals (in the "Deal Vault") and easy returns of deals (in exchange for "Groupon bucks").
Groupon MerchantOS[edit]
Groupon MerchantOS is a suite of products and tools for merchants running with Groupon. The suite includes Groupon Rewards, Groupon Scheduler and Groupon Payments.
Groupon Rewards On May 10, 2012, Groupon announced the launch of Groupon Rewards in the United States. Rewards is a loyalty program for merchants to reward customers for repeat visits with a Reward of their choosing. Unlike “buy 9 and get the 10th free” punchcards, a consumer earns Rewards by using any major credit card saved in their Groupon account when they visit their favorite local merchants. When a customer spends an amount pre-determined by the merchant, the customer unlocks a Reward to use on a future visit.[106][107] The rewards program was later removed due to lack of engineering support.[108]
Groupon Scheduler Groupon Scheduler is an online booking tool for merchants, allowing their consumers to seamlessly book appointments for services at the time of purchasing their Groupon deal. This tool is targeted at merchants running deals where appointments are required, for example in the healthy and beauty industry or for classes and activities.[109]
Groupon Payments The newest addition to the suite of merchant-facing products is Groupon Payments, which was launched in September 2012. Groupon Payments offers merchants an infrastructure for accepting credit card payments at a low cost.[110]
As of December 2015, MerchantOS is no longer a Groupon division.
Reception[edit]
Super Bowl commercial[edit]
Groupon aired a controversial Super Bowl XLV advertisement in which actor Timothy Hutton begins by making a plea for the people of Tibet before delivering the punch line: "But they still whip up an amazing fish curry."[111] Critics of the ad took to several social media outlets[112] to argue that Groupon was using the plight of Tibetans to sell their services. The following day, Groupon responded by defending their commercial and their philanthropic stance.[113][114]
The environmental organization Greenpeace praised Groupon's Super Bowl ads.[112][115] On February 10, 2011, Groupon's founder Andrew Mason apologized and pulled the ad.[116]
Violation of gift certificate expiration laws[edit]
In March 2011, Eli R. Johnson filed a lawsuit in federal court against Groupon, based on a claim that the company issues "gift certificates" that are not allowed under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act. The act prohibits retailers from setting expiration dates less than 5 years after a card is purchased.[117] The class action lawsuit was settled on December 17, 2012.[118]
Initial public offering filing[edit]
Some analysts claim that Groupon operates "like" a Ponzi scheme, according to interpretation of 2011 Initial public offering (IPO) documentation, because at the time it publicly disclosed that it is losing approximately US$100 million per quarter, had a net negative balance of $230 million, and used later investors' money to pay off earlier investors.[119] However, Groupon earned nearly $3.2 billion in consolidated revenue in 2014 and had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2014.[21]
On August 10, 2011, Groupon updated its IPO filing, after facing scrutiny from regulators and analysts over its use of a non-standard accounting metric called Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income. Critics argued that ACSOI was used by Groupon to present a misleading metric of profitability. Groupon's original IPO filing with ACSOI accounting showed a positive operating income of $60.6 million for 2010; after replacing the ACSOI metric with standard accounting metrics, Groupon's IPO filing reported an operating loss of $420 million for 2010.[120]
Analysts also criticized Groupon's decision to pay out over $940 million of the $1.12 billion in venture capital Groupon had raised before the IPO - over 84% of its venture capital raised - as cash payouts to its 3 founders and early backers, rather than into the money-losing company. Co-founder Eric Lefkofsky alone received over $300 million in early 2011, just weeks before the company filed its IPO paperwork.[121] The large cash payout also made Groupon technically insolvent when it filed for its IPO.[122]
On October 21, 2011, Groupon set terms for its IPO on NASDAQ, planning to offer 30 million shares at $16–18. The terms implied a dealsize of $510 million and a valuation of $11.2 billion. On November 4, Groupon raised $700 million, 30 percent more than it sought, valuing them at about $12.7 billion.
As of 4 November 2011 Groupon was valued at $13 billion and the float was at 35 million shares going at $20 each whereas they were last priced at between $16 and $18.[123] On their opening on Nasdaq, Groupon shares jumped more than 50 percent to a high of $29.52.[124] However, on November 22, 2011 the stock price fell below its IPO level.[125]
On Wednesday, July 11, 2012, just eight months after the company went public, Groupon's stock hit its lowest level since IPO at $7.72 and closed at $7.77.[126] On Tuesday, August 14, 2012, Groupon's stock price dropped 27% and fell as low as $5.49.[127] On Tuesday, September 3, 2012, Groupon's stock price closed at another all-time low at $4.15 dropping almost 80% below Groupon's IPO price ($20).[128]
Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission[edit]
In March 2011, the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission notified Groupon that it was in violation of state law that prohibits discounting of alcoholic beverages. Groupon notified Massachusetts subscribers of a temporary suspension in the use of its discount vouchers for alcohol at participating restaurants.[129]
UK Office of Fair Trading investigation[edit]
During 2011 there were reported breaches of British advertising regulations to the Advertising Standards Authority.[130] In December 2011 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) launched an investigation into Groupon after the firm broke regulations 48 times in 11 months.[131]
The OFT concluded in March 2012 that Groupon was in "widespread breaches" of UK consumer laws[132] and were ordered to "clean up their practices" within three months including ensuring its website was accurate, realistic, claims related to any beauty or health products offered were substantiated and that refund and cancellation policies were in accordance with current regulations.[133]
Live Off Groupon[edit]
In May 2010, Groupon created a challenge to live off Groupons for one year. The contestant Josh Stevens traveled throughout the United States and to the United Kingdom and purchased all food, drinks, travel, entertainment and more from Groupon for 365 days. At the end of the year, he received a prize of $100,000.[134]
Presence in China[edit]
Groupon has moderate online presence in China, where Meituan.com and Dianping.com control most of the market share. Due to various economic factors and regulatory framework in China, local companies are more prevalent than Groupon, just as Baidu and Renren control a larger market share than do Google and Facebook.[135]
Media related[edit]

Friend Me, a CBS sitcom based around Groupon was created in 2012, but never aired and was cancelled in 2013[136]

Groupon Goods for All Your Online Shopping
Groupon is all about helping you find new experiences, and that extends to online shopping. Our collection of consumer goods is always expanding with new items to enrich your ever-changing life, whether it’s athletic apparel to wear on that upcoming 5K or cell phone accessories to outfit your newest gadget. Welcome to Groupon Goods, your source for deals on everything from cookware to pet sweaters.
Make Home Life Easier
Keeping up a household is hard work, but Groupon carries all the items you need to maintain a full, happy home. That starts with transforming every space into an extension of yourself—a task to which our For the Home section is well suited, thanks to online deals on new bedding that suits your style or outdoor furniture to turn your patio into a second living room. To keep your family happy, Groceries & Pets stocks your pantry with items such as extra coffee pods—or bulk wine, which seems to run out just as fast—as well as toys for your loyal critters. Keeping up with the kids is a race you might never win, but at least you can stay apace as kids grow. (When they’re newborns, baby care essentials keep them safe; when they’re toddlers, toys keep parents sane.) Of course, maintaining a home or car sometimes requires a little maintenance, too, in which case keep chaos at bay with a range of home improvement supplies, including major appliances.
Stay on Trend
Online shopping isn’t just for keeping up with your busy life, though—it’s also to enrich your lifestyle. Groupon keeps up with the latest trends, adding new deals every day to a selection of clothing for both men and women. Women's Fashion comprises everything from handbags to bras, whereas Men's Fashion covers both casual and business apparel. Likewise, much of our jewelry sport unisex designs—though different shoppers may have very different motives for browsing diamond jewelry . Both men’s and women’s fragrances waft through the Health & Beauty section, along with an ever-changing variety of cosmetics, haircare, skincare, and personal hygiene products.
Play Hard
No online store is complete without a reason to have fun, so Groupon gives you plenty of ways to occupy your free time. Gadgets galore fill the Electronics section, where the virtual aisles overflow with cell phones and accessories, computers and tablets, and home theater equipment. But even the biggest HDTV is nothing without entertainment to play on it,such as movies, video games, and music—though if you’re more into books and magazines, you’ll find plenty of titles from which to choose. Not all leisure time is spent on the couch, though. Sporting goods keep you active in the Great Outdoors, outfitting you with new clubs for the golf course or plenty of provisions for a camping trip in the woods. And if it’s raining out, spend a couple happy hours adding to your collection of sports cards, commemorative coins, or other collectibles.

Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN disclosed in its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that one of its senior executives decided to leave to take a new position in another technology company.
Jeffrey Holden, senior vice president of product management at Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) will step down from his position effective March 18, 2014.
Groupon spokesperson, Bill Roberts said Holden will join a non-competitor company, and his responsibilities will be distributed by other members of the daily deal company’s team. Some insiders said Holden will be moving from Chicago to the Bay Area to work with a startup company.





Holden joined Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) after Pelago, his startup company was acquired in 2011. Pelago was developed Whrrl, a location-based service app similar to Foursquare. He previously Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
A few weeks ago, Groupon’s HR chief Brian “Skip” Schipper resigned to join Twitter Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN).
The report regarding Holden’s departure sent the stock price of Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) lower by more than 6% to $10.40 per share today.
Analysts’ reactions
Ross Sandler, analyst at Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE:DB) initially described the departure of Holden as a “potential red flag,” but changed his perception later and called it a “natural evolution for the company.” According to him, he changed his opinion after learning additional information regarding Holden’s resignation.
Sandler added that the sell-off in the shares of Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) was over reaction. He maintained his Buy rating for the stock and emphasized that the company has other talented executives. Furthermore, he believed its recently acquired flash-sale retailer, Ideeli could boost its profitability.
On the other hand, Sterne Agee analyst, Arvind Bahatia noted that the daily deals company is improving its business to become a one-stop destination for bargain hunters, and it is not only offering promotions for restaurants, spas, and gyms. According to him, Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) is now selling different products including iPhone chargers and televisions as discounted prices, and it is offering free coupons from local and national retailers. He said the company has a turnaround potential and he maintained his Buy rating for the stock.
Equity risk state
Some investors received everyday alerts from investment risk monitoring firm, Smartstops.net when the stocks in their portfolio entered a conservative or aggressive risk state. The firm uses risk management algorithms designed to calculate the normal trading range of stock for each trading day, and identify price points that fall outside of the expected trading range. Once the indicated price point is reached the stock enters elevated risk. Currently, the shares of Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) risk level is elevated. It entered the current risk state when it first traded at $9.94 per share last January 27.  Generally investors who pulled out their investments after receiving exit triggers from Smartstops.net save money.

10 Pros and Cons of Using Groupon


Group buying may be all the rage among consumers. But does is really make good business sense? Yes it can if you design the promotion just right for your company.

Groupon, the group buying site offering daily deals, has proven to be wildly popular with consumers. Great discounts are given for restaurants, retail stores, spas, theaters and much more. What's more appealing than scoring a $100 massage for $25 or grabbing a meal valued at $50 for $15? People love discounts, especially during hard times when money is tight. Investors also are enamored with Groupon. Google famously offered to buy the site for $6 billion but got rejected. Now all eyes are on the Chicago-based firm to file for an initial public offering before the year ends. A Groupon IPO will likely generate a fortune for early investors, according to market analysts. Launched in 2008, Groupon is a fast growing company, having transformed the world of online shopping. It has boosted the number of markets where it operates to 500 and has 70 million subscribers. It has a staff of 1,500 working at locations in cities throughout the U.S. and across 29 countries. The company is rumored to have generated $760 million in revenue for 2010, up from $33 million in 2009. Who's not loving Groupon? It appears to be merchants. A study by Rice University's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business surveyed 150 small to midsize businesses in 19 cities spanning 13 product categories. Findings revealed 66 percent of the merchants said the Groupon promotions were profitable while 32 percent said they were not. More than 40 percent of the companies wouldn't run a Groupon offer again. Restaurants fared the worst among service businesses with Groupon deals, while spas and salons were the most successful.The real deal is that any business looking to use Groupon, or one of its competitors like LivingSocial, must have a much broader perspective. You don't want to devote a lot of your budget to these daily deal sites. Such a promotion has to be part of your overall marketing plan along with how you are using Facebook, Twitter, Google Adwords, and so on. You can make a deal as long as it's the right one for your line of business.The problem is that businesses often go into a promotion without a good understanding of what they want to accomplish. The Rice study found that the ability of employees to handle the surge of business from bargain shoppers, for example, was critical to the success of that company's particular promotion. The way it works is that Groupon offers different deals each day for a local good, service or event in a city where it operates. Discounts range from 50 percent to 90 percent off. The promotion is only valid if a certain number of consumers purchase the deal within 24 hours. Groupon keeps 50 percent of the revenues from each coupon deal."What happens is that the Groupon promotion runs and then there is a flood of customers coming to their store," says the study's author and Jones School associate marketing professor Utpal Dholakia. Business owners don't think through their costs and how they are going to make money on the promotion. "So, in turn they end up losing a lot of money. They don't recover it from customer behavior," he explains.Take for instance a massage therapist who complained that everyone who came in for his promotion got a massage and then walked out. Most of them didn't spend anything beyond getting the freebie. He lost money on the promotion itself and there was no way to recoup that lost. Dholakia suggests that instead of promoting a particular service such as a massage or a facial, the owner should have promoted a particular dollar amount.In other words, he might have offered $100 worth of services for $50. This increases the chance that the consumer will come in and buy more than just one item. Now a newbie might come in to get a massage but then decide to get a facial as well. "You have to take advantage of an opportunity to cross-sale other products and services. You have to prepare your staff to engage customers. You have to be careful how you structure the promotion," says Dholakia. Groupon has its pros and cons, so, you need to decide if this is something worth your business getting into. Here are five reasons in favor of and five reasons against group buying promotions. Dig Deeper: 4 Tips for Using Groupon CouponsPros 1.    It attracts a lot of consumers. You can reach new customers by appealing to those who are looking for inexpensive deals and a chance to save money. You get to charge lower prices to new customers who aren't willing to pay more. Existing customers are willing to pay full price for products or services. Dholakia says that Groupon promotions offer the most benefit for businesses in which the promotion does not cannibalize sales to existing customers. 2.    It advertises your business. A Groupon promotion can be a way to announce the existence of your business to consumers who are unfamiliar with your products or services. You get to entice potential customers to try your goods. The idea is that they are going to like it so much that they will come back and buy from you again. You must make your promotion grab consumers but at the same time increase your potential conversion rate for repeat customers, says Dholakia.3.    It helps move inventory. Use Groupon deals to sell slow moving items in your inventory or unutilized services. Discounts seem to be most compelling for merchants with low cost of goods sold. Use price deals to promote a product that is not that expensive. A Groupon type promotion should be something that you do once in a while for a specific, narrow, limited reason, adds Dholakia.4.    It builds relationships. Use price promotion deals for building customer relationships rather than just creating one-time buys, recommends Dholakia. Meaning, instead of a restaurant owner offering $60 worth of food for $30, parcel it out to offer $20 worth of food for $10 over the customer's next three visits. Don't offer discounts on a total bill, rather offer a specialized discount for various products or services. 5.    It generates incremental revenue. If you have a low-cost or fixed-cost structure, you can make money on promotions. Take an owner of a rock-climbing business that has existing equipment and a storefront. The operating costs don't change based on the number of people who show up. A coupon deal can actually generate some extra cash by getting more bodies into the facility. Customers paying $10 for a $20 service, still nets the owner $5 per voucher. Dholakia says each merchant must know their costs, factor in a price that draws customers, project the number of costumers that will buy the coupon, and estimate incremental revenues.Dig Deeper: How Groupon Works for Small Businesses
Cons1.    Deals attract low-end bargain seekers. Because the Groupon customer base is made up of deal-seekers and bargain shoppers they might not be willing to purchase beyond the value of the coupon. So, there are low rates of spending and low rates of return. One problem with price deals is diminishing returns; thus, merchants need to put a cap on the number of deal coupons that are to be sold, says Dholakia. 2.    Deals hurt the brand. The obsession with price doesn't necessarily make for a lot of brand loyalty or even brand awareness. One negative aspect of daily deal sites is that price promotions usually hurt the brand of the company offering it, says Dholakia. It makes customers price sensitive. When they get something at a much lower price, they then become less inclined to pay full price for that same product or service in the future. 3.    Deals don't generate repeat customers. Groupon has a low conversion rate for repeat customers, according to marketing experts. You may never see the person again once they use your coupon. Or that person may not be willing to buy from you again without a coupon in hand. The percent of new customers that redeem the voucher that becomes repeat visitors of the business is estimated at around 19 percent. It varies by product categories. 4.    Deals are not profitable. Another problem is the split. Groupon keeps 50 percent of the revenues from each coupon deal. If you do the math, merchants need to gross margins well in excess of 50 percent for Groupon to work for them. The promotion is very steep, usually 50 percent or more. Most businesses are built on margins of 75 percent, which means if the customer just comes in and buys the deal, the owner is going to loose money, says Dholakia. Restaurants usually have higher margins. "By offering huge discounts and giving 50 percent to Groupon, they just aren't earning enough to cover the cost of serving that customer." 5.    There are better deals out there. Daily deals sites are not the only game in town. You can run a similar promotion for less money. There are plenty of marketing programs you can use; does it make sense to use this one, asks Dholakia. For example, you can offer a discount or promotion on a Facebook fan page. It's an effective way to engage new and existing customers at a very low cost, he adds.
