Dr. Mark Grether, Executive Chairman

Mark is the Executive Chairman of Sizmek, where he is focused on guiding the company and its leadership team and accelerating the growth of the business. Prior to Sizmek, Mark was the cofounder and global Chief Operating Officer of WPP’s Xaxis, which under his leadership grew into the largest programmatic media company in the world, with more than $1 billion in revenue in just five years. Prior to Xaxis, he was Global Development Director of GroupM, the world’s largest media investment group, where he was instrumental in setting up GroupM’s digital trading desk across 10 countries. Mark also spent time in academia, teaching at university in Germany after receiving his PhD in Marketing from the University of Mannheim, until the lure of real-world marketing data drew him onto the ever-compelling advertising technology trajectory. Since 2011, Mark has lived in New York City with his wife and two sons, who he attempts to one up at soccer each weekend—but they’ve got mad skills.










Ken Saunders, Chief Financial Officer

Ken Saunders joined Sizmek as CFO in October 2014. He brings global financial expertise to Sizmek, having served as Chief Financial Officer at a number of technology companies. Prior to Sizmek, Saunders was a Partner at Black Dragon Capital, where he served as CFO of two portfolio companies he helped establish: Fortress Risk Management (a fraud monitoring and compliance solutions company) and Payveris (a next generation payments platform company). Prior to those roles, he was CFO of BeyondTrust Software, where he helped acquire and integrate six companies helping to triple revenues in his first two years with the company. Saunders joined BeyondTrust from Bazaarvoice, Inc., where, as the company's first CFO, he helped establish the company's financial processes and controls, corporate information systems and develop its IT organization, while helping to triple revenues over his tenure.










Rachel Walkden, Chief Operating Officer

Rachel Walkden is Chief Operating Officer of Sizmek. A born productivity buff, Rachel focuses on delivering world-class service and support to Sizmek’s clients around the globe. Whether you drive the platform yourself or Sizmek does it on your behalf, Rachel leads a team of ops ninjas who partner with you every step of the way from day one. Rachel has many years of experience in digital media operations, including leading global operations at Operative, growing the services business there three-fold, and as COO for Ringleader Digital, scaling up the business more than ten-fold. When not focused on figuring out ways for Sizmek to serve its customers better, Rachel likes to be doing something adventurous and vaguely dangerous.










Volker Hatz, Chief Data Officer

As Chief Data Officer, Volker Hatz oversees Sizmek’s fast-growing data business, including data governance solutions and analytics initiatives, and product marketing. Prior to joining Sizmek, Volker was Global Head of SAP XM DMP Solution at SAP Exchange Media. Throughout his career, he’s played key roles in creating groundbreaking technology to bring structure to the stores of data that digital advertising has uncovered, including the first demand-side advertising platform, the first second-party data management platform, and the first real-time cookie-less targeting. When Volker’s not driving innovation in data or spending time with his wife and four children, he’s swinging his nine iron on the golf course, aiming for that elusive hole in one.










Mike Caprio, Chief Growth Officer

As Chief Growth Officer, Mike oversees Sizmek’s partnerships, business development, global holding companies, supply solutions, programmatic business unit, and Peer39.  Mike’s 20-year career spans across traditional and digital advertising, leading companies such as Disney, CBS, and Visible World, and cofounding SWMX, the first demand-side and supply-side platform for buying TV and radio.  When Mike’s not growing new business for Sizmek, you can probably find him making a mean marinara sauce for his wife and two sons down at the Jersey shore or obsessing over the latest Yankees, Giants, Knicks, or Rangers game—Mike’s a superfan and doesn’t take a season off.   










Canaan Schladale-Zink, General Manager, Americas 

Canaan Schladale-Zink is Sizmek’s General Manager of the Americas. With more than a decade of experience in sales and operations, Canaan now leads one of the most dynamic teams in the ad tech industry. Canaan started his career in television advertising at Katz Media Group, where his curiosity and youthful naiveté of corporate red tape led him to selling one of the first online video deals for the organization. At that point, he was hooked on digital advertising, and moved to Eyewonder, which was acquired by Sizmek, and launched him on the trajectory to helping major advertisers and agencies navigate the complex creative, media, and tech landscape across display, mobile, video, social, and programmatic advertising.










Andrew Bloom, General Manager, EMEA

Andrew Bloom is General Manager, EMEA, where he leads Sizmek’s sales teams, publisher business, and business development efforts. Before Andrew acquired so many initials in his title, he was in charge of partner development at Spot Runner and led acquisitions, partnerships, strategy, and innovation at Getty Images. In his previous life, Andrew was also a senior associate at New York-based Accelerator Group, and a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell and Slaughter and May. In his nonworking hours, Andrew loves to obsess over football (a.k.a. “soccer”): coaching his son’s team, playing for Geezer FC every weekend at sunrise, or watching his beloved Arsenal.

Ad Description: The HTML5 Responsive Billboard format can be used for creating a responsive billboard effect on a publisher’s page.  This format has two different states: the expanded or banner state (Billboard) and the collapsed/unexpanded state (Leave Behind). The billboard can adjust to different breakpoints, either animating responsively between breakpoints as the ad is resized, or snapping between breakpoints without a transitional animation (using the mdSnapPointAnimation variable).

Ad Description: The Responsive Expandable is an expandable format that is able to resize responsively or adaptively to fill the available space. Different rules for responsive behavior can be separately customized for the banner and the panels. The format also supports using fixed sizes for ad placements that do not change size.

For example, you can now set the banner to responsive to the advertiser container so that the unit resizes as the advertiser div resizes, or you can even appear full width and fixed height in the browser for a hero-style banner. The panel has many customizations available, such as adaptive scaling, matching the banner for dimensions as you resize, or scaling by aspect ratio. You can also turn the expanded panel into a fullscreen unit for the width and height, by customizing it to expand to those dimensions.

Ad Description: The Vertical Videostitial is a video format that expands to reveal a full screen, responsive video ad. In the expansion panel, there is no content besides the video and a close button.  Expectations are that the format will always be shown in full screen mode, but there are options for cropping the video and surrounding it with a black mask.  The format is intended for videos that have been shot vertically so that it looks great on phones while held in portrait mode.  Portions of the video may be trimmed so that you are always presented with a full screen video across mobile devices and browsers of varying sizes and aspect ratios.   However, this format is not restricted to only vertically shot video.  Based on the dimensions of the video and customizations supplied to the ad, videos may be set up to look great in both portrait and landscape modes across desktop, tablet and mobile browsers as well as in mobile apps.

Ad Description: The Billboard is a top-performing IAB Rising Star format that appears initially as a 970x250 banner and contains a prominent “close ad” button in the top right corner. If a user clicks the button, the ad will collapse into a tiny banner in the top right corner, and the publisher page content will shift up to fill in the space. This format includes images, videos, user actions and click-through buttons, but it can be customized with interactive features ranging from games to face recognition. Some publishers permit a companion banner or a drag feature that can reveal additional content.

Ad Description: Note: For the HTML5 Versions of this format, you must select "HTML5 Pushdown Banner" format on the platform when using the Single Expandable version of Pushdown and you must select "HTML5 Pushdown" format on the platform when using the Expandable Banner version.  You MUST be careful not to mix up these two formats when setting up your HTML5 ads.

The Pushdown format pushes site content down as the ad expands, allowing the user to still see site content after expansion. The ad loads in the collapsed state, then the ad can either be expanded or clicked through to another site by tapping the buttons. From the expanded state, the user may either click the UserAction button or close the ad and return to the collapsed state. Clicking the UserAction button sends a custom interaction and is tracked in reports. Some Pushdown templates contain a video player, which is set up to track video interactions.

Ad Description: The Pandora Responsive Banner is a responsive format that dynamically chooses the ad’s banner size based on the available space within the Pandora app. Pandora supplies a square “L1” ad container that will be different sizes on different phones/tablets based not only on the device but the orientation of the device. The Pandora Responsive Banner will fill the “L1” ad container, but if a clickthrough is performed, the URL is opened up in the larger “L2” ad container space.

Ad Description: The Cascade format is initially 940x230 in size and allows for multiple panels of rich content. Up and down arrows allow the user to scroll through the available panels and display a cascade-like animation during navigation. Clicking the more button on any panel expands the unit to display the next panel in the series using a unique 3D flipbook-like animation (more button only displays if there is room in the viewport for expansion). The Cascade is a great way to present videos, image galleries, product carousels, social features, and more - then let the user decide which interests them the most.

Ad Description: The “HTML5 Full-Screen Expandable” format contains a call to action to expand the ad over the page content. The ad loads with banner on page with expand button, clicking expand button expands the ad to full size of the screen on a mobile device or to the full size of the browser window on a desktop. On mobile devices the expansion will even dynamically resize as the orientation changes (e.g. portrait or landscape) or dynamically resize as a desktop browser is resized. This format allows one tag to be served across different domains where Certification and Support can use the “Domain Configuration Tool” to change custom variables, JavaScript and CSS on specific domains so a single tag can work everywhere as expected, which means different custom variable settings can be used across different sites and site sections.Note: A similar format that was based on the Single Expandable called “HTML5 Full Screen Expandable Banner” has been deprecated and all users should be creating their full screen expandable ads with this format going forward

Ad Description: The HTML5 Scroll Reveal is a HTML5 format that creates a full-screen ad experience once the ad scrolls into view.  It’s not as though the ad scrolls with the page content.  On the contrary, as publisher content scrolls, the ad pushes up or pushes down publisher content and opens up a view window for a fixed, full-screen wallpaper ad.
