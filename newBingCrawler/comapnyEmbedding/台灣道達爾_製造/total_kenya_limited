Compagnie française des pétroles (CFP): 1924–1985[edit]
The company was founded after World War I, when then French Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré rejected the idea of forming a partnership with Royal Dutch Shell in favour of creating an entirely French oil company. At Poincaré's behest, Col. Ernest Mercier with the support of ninety banks and companies founded Total on 28 March 1924, as the Compagnie française des pétroles (CFP), literally the "French Petroleum Company". Petroleum was seen as vital in the case of a new war with Germany.
As per the agreement reached during the San Remo conference of 1920, the French state received the 25% share held by Deutsche Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) as part of the compensation for war damages caused by Germany during World War I. The French government's stake in TPC was transferred to CFP,[4] and the Red Line agreement in 1928 rearranged the shareholding of CPF in TPC (later renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929) to 23.75%.[5] The company from the start was regarded as a private sector company in view of its listing on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1929.
The company during the 1930s was engaged in exploration and production, primarily from the Middle East. Its first refinery began operating in Normandy in 1933. After World War II, CFP engaged in oil exploration in Venezuela, Canada, and Africa while pursuing energy sources within France. Exploration in Algeria, then a French colony, began in 1946, with Algeria becoming a leading source of oil in the 1950s.[6]
In 1954, CFP introduced its downstream product – Total brand of gasoline in the African continent and Europe.[6][7]
In 1980, Total Petroleum (North America) Ltd., a company controlled 50% by CFP, bought the American refining and marketing assets of Vickers Petroleum as part of a sell-off by Esmark of its energy holdings. This purchase gave Total refining capacity, transportation, and a network of 350 service stations in 20 states.[8][9][10]
Total CFP and re branding to Total: 1985–2003[edit]
The company renamed itself Total CFP in 1985, to build on the popularity of its gasoline brand.[7] Later in 1991, the name was changed to Total, when it became a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The French government, who used to control more than 30 percent of the company's stock in 1991, reduced its stake in the firm to less than 1 percent by 1996[7][11] In the time period between 1990 and 1994, foreign ownership of the firm increased from 23 per cent to 44 per cent.
Meanwhile, Total continued to expand its retail presence in North America under several brand names. In 1989, Denver, Colorado, based Total Petroleum, Total CFP's North American unit, purchased 125 Road Runner retail locations from Texarkana, Texas-based Truman Arnold Companies.[12] By 1993, Total Petroleum was operating 2,600 retail stores under the Vickers, Apco, Road Runner, and Total brands. That year, the company began remodeling and rebranding all of its North American gasoline and convenience stores to use the Total name.[13] Only four years later, Total sold its North American refining and retail operations to Ultramar Diamond Shamrock for $400 million in stock and $414 million in assumed debt.[14]
After Total's takeover of Petrofina of Belgium in 1999, it became known as Total Fina. Afterwards it also acquired Elf Aquitaine. First named TotalFinaElf after the merger in 2000, it was later renamed back to Total on 6 May 2003. During that rebranding, the current globe logo was unveiled.[15]

Total: 2003–present[edit]
In 2003, Total signed for a 30% stake in the gas exploration venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) – South Rub' al-Khali joint venture along with Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco.[16] The stake was later bought out by its partners.
In May 2006, Saudi Aramco and TOTAL signed a MOU to develop the Jubail Refinery and Petrochemical project in Saudi Arabia which targeted 400,000 barrels per day (bpd). On 21 September 2008, the two companies officially established a joint venture called SAUDI ARAMCO TOTAL Refining and Petrochemical Company (SATORP)- in which a 62.5% stake was held by Saudi Aramco and the balance 37.5% held by TOTAL.[17][18]
During the 2009-2010 Iraqi oil services contracts tender, a consortium led by CNPC (37.5%), which also included TOTAL (18.75%) and Petronas (18.75%) was awarded a production contract for the "Halfaya field" in the south of Iraq, which contains an estimated 4.1 billion barrels (650,000,000 m3) of oil.[19][20]
As of 2010, Total is one of the world's major oil companies, with over 96,000 employees and operates in more than 130 countries.[21] In September 2010, Total announced plans to pull out of the forecourt market in the United Kingdom.[22]
In November 2012, Total announced it was selling its 20% stake and operating mandate in its Nigerian offshore project to a unit of China Petrochemical Corp for $2.5 billion.[23] In 2013, Total started the operation at Kashagan with North Caspian Operating Company.[24] It is the biggest discovery of oil reserves since 1968. In 2013, Total increased its stake in Novatek to 16.96%.[25][26]
In September 2013, Total and its joint venture partner agreed to buy Chevron Corporation’s retail distribution business in Pakistan for an undisclosed amount.[27]
In January 2014, Total became the first major oil and gas firm to acquire exploration rights for shale gas in the UK after it bought a 40 percent interest in two licences in the Gainsborough Trough area of northern England for $48 million.[28] In July 2014, the company disclosed it was in exclusive talks to sell its LPG distribution business in France to Pennsylvania-based UGI Corporation for €450 million ($615 million).[29]
On 20 October 2014, at 23:57 MST a Dassault Falcon 50 business jet heading to Paris caught fire and exploded during takeoff after colliding with a snow removal vehicle in Vnukovo International Airport, and killing four, including three crew members and CEO of Total S.A. Christophe de Margerie on board. Alcohol presence was confirmed in the blood of the driver of the vehicle on the ground.[30]
Patrick Pouyanne, who was Total's Refining Chief at that time, was appointed as CEO after Christophe de Margerie died.[31] Patrick Pouyanné was appointed chairman of Total on December 16, 2015, in addition to his role as CEO.
In February 2015, Total unveiled plans to cut 180 jobs in the United Kingdom, reduce refinery capacity and slow spending on North Sea fields after it fell to a $5.7bn final-quarter loss. The company said it would also sell off $5bn worth of assets worldwide and cut exploration costs by 30%.[32]
Total says it would still principally be an oil and gas company but aims to be 20% low-carbon by 2035 said Patrick Pouyanné, CEO and Chairman in May 2016.[33]
In June 2016, to expand its gas and power distribution activities, Total signed a $224m deal to buy Lampiris, the third largest Belgian supplier of gas and renewable energy.[34]
In July 2016, Total agreed to buy French battery maker Saft Groupe SA in a $1.1bn deal, to boost its development in renewable energy and electricity businesses.[35]
By the 14 October 2016 the company had a share value of 111,581 million euros, distributed in 2,528,459,212 shares. The shares are owned by a large number of shareholders, the biggest being : Blackrock (5.02%), the employees of Total SA (4.90%), the company itself (4,70%), the Group Bruxelles Lambert (2,50%).
Total has agreed to acquire $2.2-billion in upstream and downstream assets from Petrobras as part of the firms’ strategic alliance announced in October 2016.[36] For Total, these new partnerships with Petrobras reinforce Total’s position in Brazil through access to new fields in the Santos Basin while entering the gas value chain.
Between 2013 and 2017 Total has organized the ARGOS Challenge, a robotic competition with the aim to develop robots for their oil and gas production sites.[37] It was won by an Austrian-German team using a variant of the taurob tracker robot.[38]
In July 2017, Total has signed a major deal for a total amount of $4.8b with Iran for the development and production of South Pars, the world's largest gas field[39].

Total has been a longtime partner of Citroën Sport in the World Rally Championship, Dakar Rally and World Touring Car Championship. Sébastien Loeb won nine WRC drivers titles, whereas Ari Vatanen and Pierre Lartigue won four editions of the Dakar Rally.
Total has been a partner of Peugeot Sport in Formula One from 1995 to 2000, the British Touring Car Championship in 1995 and 1996 and since 2001 in the World Rally Championship, Intercontinental Rally Challenge, 24 Hours of Le Mans, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, Dakar Rally and Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

Their logo appeared on the Red Bull Racing cars since 2009, the Renault F1 cars in 2009, 2010 and 2016, and the Lotus F1 cars from 2011-2014.

In terms of educational development Total provides scholarships worth millions of euros annually to international students to study in France. These programs are mainly for master's degree. Doctoral scholarships are also offered but in limited numbers. The student come from mainly from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle-East where Total Operates. Students from Africa are mainly from Nigeria. The scholarship involves the payment of Tuition and a monthly allowance of 1400 Euros (2014 disbursement). The allowance is able to cater for feeding, transportation and accommodation for the students. The drop in oil prices in 2015 has led to the reduction of the number of scholars.
The scholarship scheme has come under a lot of criticism for various reasons. Some scholars believe the flat rate of 1400 euros is unfair as the cost of living for cities in France are not the same. Also, students have complained that the monthly allowance needs to be reviewed and upgraded to 2000 euros monthly. Other criticism include the fact that the number of PHd. scholarship slots are very small compared to the master's degree slots.
In July 2016, Total has secured an eight-year sponsorship package from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to support 10 of its principal competitions. Total will start with the Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Gabon therefore renaming it Total Africa cup of Nations.
Environmental and safety records[edit]
In 1998 the Total SA company was fined €375,000 for an oil spill that stretched 400 kilometers from La Rochelle to the western tip of Brittany. The company was only fined that amount because they were only partially liable because Total SA did not own the ship. The plaintiffs had sought more than $1.5 billion in damages. More than 100 groups and local governments joined in the suit. The Total company was fined just over $298,000. The majority of the money will go to the French government, several environmental groups, and various regional governments. The Total SA company was also fined $550,000 for the amount of marine pollution that came from it. After the oil spill they tried to restore their image and have opened a sea turtle conservation project in Masirah in recent years.
Prior to the verdict in which Total was found guilty one of the counterparts in the incident, Malta Maritime Authority (MMA), was not to be tried for having any hand in the incident. In 2005 Total submitted a report to the Paris courts which stated that Total had gotten a group of experts that stated the tanker had corrosion on it and that Total was responsible for it. The courts sought a second expert reviewing of this information which was turned down.[54]
The AZF chemical plant which exploded in 2001 in Toulouse, France, belonged to the Grande Paroisse branch of Total.
On 13 August 2007, Total announced a lower fuel emission, lower emissions and cost-efficient petroleum product, named Evolution. Evolution is designed to let its user use less fuel and get further than other fuels. The product was developed exclusively for Total because of the demand for more energy efficient products. This fuel can be used with any engine that runs on unleaded.[citation needed]
On 16 January 2008, Total was required to compensate all of the victims of the pollution caused by the sinking of the ship Erika. They are required to compensate the victims in the amount of €192 million. This is in addition to the €200 million that Total spent to help clean up the spill. The company appealed against the verdict, lost the case in the following two appeals and was definitely condemned.
Climate Commitments[edit]
Total has published in May 2016 a first Climate Report to detail its action as a company and with its partners to meet the growing demand for energy while limiting its impact on the climate. Total's climate strategy is based on those three pillars : improving the carbon intensity of its energy mix, its energy efficiency and developing renewable energies.[55]
Total is also member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) which is a CEO-led initiative which aims to show sector leadership in the response to climate change. OGCI is made up of ten oil and gas companies that collaborate on action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In November 2016, the OGCI announced the launch of a 1 billion dollar climate investment fund[56] to invest in cutting the climate change impact of fossil fuels. The fund will support start-ups and help develop and demonstrate innovative technologies that have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly and also focus on ways to reduce costs of carbon capture and storage technology.
Controversies[edit]
Total SA has been involved in multiple controversies. Hereafter there is a list of the main ones.
Malta[edit]
Total is being implicated in a bribe commission scandal which is currently[when?] emerging in Malta. It has emerged that Total had told Maltese agents that it would not be interested in doing business with them unless their team included George Farrugia, who is under investigation in the procurement scandal. George Farrugia has recently been given a presidential pardon in exchange of informations about this scandal. Enemalta, Malta's energy supplier, swiftly barred Total and its agents, Trafigura from bidding and tenders. An investigation is currently underway and three people have been arraigned.[citation needed]
Myanmar investments[edit]
Despite the European Union's sanctions against the military dictatorship Myanmar, Total is able to operate the Yadana natural gas pipeline from Burma to Thailand. Total is currently the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for the condoning and use of the country's civilian slavery to construct the pipeline. The documentary 'Total Denial' shows the background of this project.[57][unreliable source?] The NGO Burma Campaign UK is currently[when?] campaigning against this project.
Italian bribes[edit]
On 16 December 2008, the managing director of the Italian division of Total, Lionel Levha, and ten other executives were arrested by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Potenza, Italy, for a corruption charge of €15 million to undertake the oilfield in Basilicata on contract. Also arrested was the local deputy of Partito Democratico Salvatore Margiotta and an Italian entrepreneur.[58][59]
UN Oil-for-Food Programme for Iraq[edit]
In April 2010, Total was accused of bribing Iraqi officials during former president Saddam Hussein's regime to secure oil supplies. A United Nations report later revealed that Iraqi officials had received bribes from oil companies to secure contracts worth over $10bn.[60] On 26 February 2016 Paris court of appeals considered Total guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 750,000 euros for corrupting Iraqi civil servants. The court's ruling overturns an earlier acquittal in the case.
Bribery in Iran[edit]
In 2013, a case was settled that concerned charges that Total bribed an Iranian official with $60 million, which they documented as a "consulting charge," and which unfairly gave them access to Iran's Sirri A and Sirri E oil and gas fields. The bribery gave them a competitive advantage, earning them an estimated $150 million in profits. The Securities Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice settled the charges, expecting Total to pay $398 million.[61]
Western Sahara oil exploration[edit]
In October 2001, Total signed a contract for oil-reconnaissance in areas offshore Western Sahara (near Dakhla), with the "Moroccan Office National de Recherches et d’Exploitations Petrolières" (ONAREP). In January 2002, Hans Corell (the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs) stated in a letter to the President of the Security Council that whenever the contracts are only for exploration they're not illegal, but if further exploration or exploitation are against the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the principles of international law.[62] Finally, Total decided to not renew their license off Western Sahara.[63]

By QUEEN MUNGUTI
Posted Sunday, January 1 2017 at 13:48
    --  Firms that continually improve products have best chance of bouncing back to the top.
Oil marketer Total Kenya has launched a new range of fuels in a move that could see it recover the 1.3 per cent loss of its market share to smaller distributors as reported by the Petroleum Institute of East Africa.
"Total Excellium (for both petrol and diesel engines) contains detergents which clean the sensitive engine parts such as injectors and intake valves. It contributes to a reduction in polluting emissions, by improving running of the engine which protects our environment. Additionally, Total Excellium additive results in reduced foaming of diesel, especially during filling," said the company in a statement.
By embracing product innovation, the firm seeks to regain its market share and maintain its market leadership, which stands at 16.7 per cent, as evidence shows that brands that lose this top spot rarely recover it.
"Market share leadership is a strategic imperative at many leading companies and so that is why they should fight hard to retain it, because once it is lost, it is nearly always permanent," reads research paper Long-Term Market Leadership Persistence: Baselines, Economic Conditions, and Category Types published by the Marketing Science Institute, which specialises in marketing theory and business practice research.
The researchers conducted a search of archival records to compile a dataset of market share leaders in 125 consumer products from 1921 to 2010 as well as a second study that analysed the quarterly positions in 883 consumer product categories from 2003 to 2008.
They observed that 66 per cent of the companies that were market leaders for a long period continuously innovated their products to meet consumer needs. They also found that only four per cent of the companies that were replaced by a different company ever reclaimed the top spot.
"When brands lose their leading status, they typically have very limited time in which to reclaim it, that is why few companies are able to get back on top after just three quarters below the leader. Also, losing the top spot does not mean a company will settle into a close second, the gap in market share between the top two brands on average, after ceding the first place, was found to be more than 10 per cent," said the researchers.
For Total Kenya, it is seeking to widen the gap between its close second competitor Vivo Kenya, which has 16.6 per cent market share, and get back customers with its latest product innovations.
One brand that embraced this strategy and regained its lost market share was global nutrition company, Nestle. Last year, sales of its instant noodle brand, Maggi, were affected in India following a ban in the country, but in November, it relaunched after five months.
In that month it managed to win back 10.9 per cent of the market share. But it later introduced 25 new products, entering into different categories by targeting its 'lost' consumers and new ones. Its market share was 77 per cent before the ban.
In August, it was reported that the company's product innovation strategy had paid off as it had reclaimed its market leadership position, achieving a 57.1 per cent share of the instant noodle market in India.
"Growth in the India market turned positive due to good progress with the Maggi noodle relaunch and favourable comparables. We regained a leading market share position," said the company in a statement.
Faced with this evidence, Kenya's leading brands that embrace product innovation as a marketing strategy stand the best chance of keeping close competitors at bay and maintaining their top spot.
