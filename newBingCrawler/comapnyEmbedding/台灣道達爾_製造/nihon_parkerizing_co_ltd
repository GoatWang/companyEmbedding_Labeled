We liberate metal from rust! Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. was established in 1928 with the introduction of the Parkerizing method of phosphating treatment of steel from Parker Rust Proof Company. Nihon Parkerizing's conversion coating treatments, including our representative phosphating treatment, have become core technologies for multi-functional products and include paint bases, lubricant bases, wear resistant applications for sliding parts, bases for adhesive bonding and applications for cold forming. We will continue to utilize our original technology to satisfy a diverse range of needs. 




Chemical bonding enables the maintenance of a strong lubricant layer for cold forming. 




We offer an extensive range of metal hardening treatments from the conventional to the very latest metal hardening treatments.




A combination of conversion coating and resin coating provides corrosion resistance in addition to other functions.




Nihon Parkerizing's original surface hardening method, ISONITE, dramatically improves the characteristics of a variety of ferrous metals. 




Salt-bath carburizing is a unique treatment method for achieving hardening of steel with no distortion or cracks. 




AUSTEMPER treatment promises to not only improve characteristics but also create a beautiful finish with minimal dimensional change.




Functional particles are dispersed in the plating bath and made to disperse in the metal matrix. 
When combined with heat treatment, the corrosion resistance, thermal resistance and wear resistance characteristics can be further strengthened.




This product forms an extremely hard ceramic film on light metals. 
Characteristics: high degree of hardness, exceptional wear resistance, high corrosion resistance, high thermal resistance.




The use of bare weathering steel first became widespread in the U.S. due to the cost advantage and attractive appearance of rust. However, in Japan, where rainfall is high and the climate can be hot and humid, the initial rust outflow and rust dust caused significant pollution in the vicinity of the structures. Furthermore, it was difficult to form a stable rust layer on parts where ventilation was poor or there was frequent condensation, significantly limiting the use of bare weathering steel. As a manufacturer of metal surface treatments, Nihon Parkerizing took up the challenge to solve these problems with our surface treatment technology by developing the WEATHERCOAT method for developing a stable rust layer on weathering steel, in collaboration with Nippon Steel Corporation.

Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. - Case Study

Convert current auto faxing to OPROARTS and reduced cost dramatically.-Developed console tool which make conversion to inexpensive cost in short time-
Expanded available service, reduced faxing cost by 30%!Managed to introduce the system in short time with inexpensive cost by using OPROARTS console.

Expanded available service, reduced faxing cost by 30%!
Process of consideration

Nihon Parkerizing Co., Ltd. had already faxing service to fax reports from core system. Fax differs from other type of transmission, depending of pages and time, fees are fixed and when Nihon Parkerizing was thinking they need to review for cost cut, they heard about OPROARTS Prime from consultant.
Nihon Parkerizing was faxing over 3,500 pages a month and it was worthwhile to introduce the system.
 
Effectiveness of introduction
Approximately managed to reduce 30% faxing cost. The system they had allowed them to confirm the status such as report image (download) and changing report layout but they were all with additional cost. Besides cost reduction, usability also increased with OPROARTS.
Managed to introduce the system in short time with inexpensive cost by using OPROARTS console.
Subject to switch over the service

As mentioned earlier, Nihon Parkerizing has been using auto fax system by current service. It had been programed to integrate with current core system and in order to change over to OPROARTS, they require to modification programing to report sending via fax. This was important fact that they minimize the cost on this, and by inputting CSV file, this was managed within their plan.
 
Use OPROARTS console
To introduce OPROARTS, by using the console tool (by Axeeds Co., Ltd) to integrate with user system, they have managed to reduce the development and its cost prior to introduction. By these factors, they have introduced the system easily with relationship to current system. (introduction cost was set off as 8 months depreciation)
Major Effectiveness

Reduce fax running cost by 30%
Reduce initial cost by console function of OPROARTS
