	Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA operates within the Petroleum refining sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA with three other
	petroleum refiners in Europe:
		
	Galp Energia SGPS, S.A.
	
		of Portugal
		(2016
	sales of 13.24 billion Euro [US$15.69  billion]
		of which 79%
		was Refining & Distribution of Petroleum Pro),
	
	Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS
	
		of Turkey
		(34.85 billion Turkish Liras [US$9.90  billion]
		), and
	
	MOL Magyar Olaj es Gazipari Nyilvanosan Mukodo Reszvenytarsasag
	
		which is
		
		based in Hungary
		(3.55 trillion Hungarian Forints [US$13.82  billion]
		of which 93%
		was Downstream).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Esso Societe Anonyme Francaise SA were 11.15 billion Euro (US$13.21 billion).
	
		This
		
			is
		
			a
			
			decrease of 10.0%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 12.39 billion Euro.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 25.4% decline
		in Semi-Finished Products, from 1.37 billion Euro to 1.02 billion Euro.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Distillers (down 10.0% to 4.29 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Automobile (down 15.0% to 1.58 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Lubricants and Specialities (down 13.1% to 832.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Aviation (down 20.5% to 486.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Heavy Fuels (down 13.9% to 230.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Services (down 9.4% to 222.00 million Euro)
				
					and
				Lpg (down 11.9% to 118.00 million Euro)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Interial Tax/petrol Products (up 5.4% to 2.06 billion Euro)
				
					and
				Petrol - Brut (up 37.4% to 301.00 million Euro)

More...Did you know ?On the Infinancials platform, there are two ways to identify the listed peers which most closely resemble a private firm:- with Peer Tracker if you already know a listed peer.Peer Tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications. The degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores.- with Market Screener if you have no listed peer in mind.Market Screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria, identifying peers, searching for comparable companies in a specific business sector.About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
