        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

For almost three-quarters of a century, Chevron has been manufacturing and marketing quality lubricants around the world. In today’s highly complex and competitive market, Chevron’s high performance brands and value-added services are a result of the combination of resources and technology of the entire Chevron Lubricants organization. Well-known brands such as Havoline, Delo and Caltex have established both a local and international reputation for reliability and unsurpassed quality and performance. Among the company’s comprehensive range of products, the Lanka branded items which were formally a local product but subsequently brought under the Caltex umbrella maintaining international standards, have held a firm reputation for excellence and performance in Sri Lanka.
Our brands stand for quality, value and service. Most importantly, it stands for our commitment to you-our customer. Our creed of quality, professionalism, service and efficiency dictates that you are always satisfied with our distinctive value offer and exceptional product portfolio.
