Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is an Indian multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. It is a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) of the Government of India, under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. It is India's largest oil and gas exploration and production company. It produces around 77% of India's crude oil (equivalent to around 30% of the country's total demand) and around 62% of its natural gas.[3]
On 31 March 2013, its market capitalisation was INR 2.6 trillion (US$48.98 billion), making it India's second largest publicly traded company.[4][5] In a government survey for fiscal year 2011–12, it was ranked as the largest profit making PSU in India.[6] ONGC has been ranked 449th in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations for the year 2015.[7] It is ranked 17th among the Top 250 Global Energy Companies by Platts.[8]
ONGC was founded on 14 August 1956 by Government of India, which currently holds a 68.94% equity stake. It is involved in exploring for and exploiting hydrocarbons in 26 sedimentary basins of India, and owns and operates over 11,000 kilometers of pipelines in the country. Its international subsidiary ONGC Videsh currently has projects in 17 countries. ONGC has discovered 6 of the 7 commercially producing Indian Basins, in the last 50 years, adding over 7.1 billion tonnes of In-place Oil & Gas volume of hydrocarbons in Indian basins. Against a global decline of production from matured fields, ONGC has maintained production from its brownfields like Mumbai High, with the help of aggressive investments in various IOR (Improved Oil Recovery) and EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) schemes. ONGC has many matured fields with a current recovery factor of 25–33%.[3] Its Reserve Replacement Ratio for between 2005 and 2013, has been more than one.[3] During FY 2012–13, ONGC had to share the highest ever under-recovery of INR 494.2 billion (an increase of INR 49.6 million over the previous financial year) towards the under-recoveries of Oil Marketing Companies (IOC, BPCL and HPCL).[3]

History[edit]
Foundation to 1961[edit]
Before the independence of India in 1947, the Assam Oil Company in the north-eastern and Attock Oil company in north-western part of the undivided India were the only oil producing companies, with minimal exploration input. The major part of Indian sedimentary basins was deemed to be unfit for development of oil and gas resources.[9]
After independence, the Central Government of India realized the importance of oil and gas for rapid industrial development and its strategic role in defense. Consequently, while framing the Industrial Policy Statement of 1948, the development of petroleum industry in the country was considered to be of utmost necessity.[9]
Until 1955, private oil companies mainly carried out exploration of hydrocarbon resources of India. In Assam, the Assam Oil Company was producing oil at Digboi (discovered in 1889) and Oil India Ltd. (a 50% joint venture between Government of India and Burmah Oil Company) was engaged in developing two newly discovered large fields Naharkatiya and Moraan in Assam. In West Bengal, the Indo-Stanvac Petroleum project (a joint venture between Government of India and Standard Vacuum Oil Company of USA) was engaged in exploration work. The vast sedimentary tract in other parts of India and adjoining offshore remained largely unexplored.[9]
In 1955, Government of India decided to develop the oil and natural gas resources in the various regions of the country as part of the Public Sector development. With this objective, an Oil and Natural Gas Directorate was set up towards the end of 1955, as a subordinate office under the then Ministry of Natural Resources and Scientific Research. The department was constituted with a nucleus of geoscientists from the Geological Survey of India.[9]
A delegation under the leadership of the Minister of Natural Resources visited several European countries to study the status of oil industry in those countries and to facilitate the training of Indian professionals for exploring potential oil and gas reserves. Experts from Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States and West Germany subsequently visited India and helped the government with their expertise. Soviet experts later drew up a detailed plan for geological and geophysical surveys and drilling operations to be carried out in the 2nd Five Year Plan (1956–61).[9]
In April 1956, the Government of India adopted the Industrial Policy Resolution, which placed Mineral Oil Industry among the schedule 'A' industries, the future development of which was to be the sole and exclusive responsibility of the state.[9]
Soon, after the formation of the Oil and Natural Gas Directorate, it became apparent that it would not be possible for the Directorate with its limited financial and administrative powers as subordinate office of the Government, to function efficiently. So in August, 1956, the Directorate was raised to the status of a commission with enhanced powers, although it continued to be under the government. In October 1959, the Commission was converted into a statutory body by an act of the Indian Parliament, which enhanced powers of the commission further. The main functions of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission subject to the provisions of the Act, were "to plan, promote, organize and implement programs for development of Petroleum Resources and the production and sale of petroleum and petroleum products produced by it, and to perform such other functions as the Central Government may, from time to time, assign to it ". The act further outlined the activities and steps to be taken by ONGC in fulfilling its mandate.[9]
1961 to 2000[edit]




An ONGC platform at Bombay High in the Arabian Sea


Since its inception, ONGC has been instrumental in transforming the country's limited upstream sector into a large viable playing field, with its activities spread throughout India and significantly in overseas territories. In the inland areas, ONGC not only found new resources in Assam but also established new oil province in Cambay basin (Gujarat), while adding new petroliferous areas in the Assam-Arakan Fold Belt and East coast basins (both onshore and offshore).[9] ONGC went offshore in the early 1970s and discovered a giant oil field in the form of Bombay High, now known as Mumbai High. This discovery, along with subsequent discoveries of huge oil and gas fields in Western offshore changed the oil scenario of the country. Subsequently, over 5 billion tonnes of hydrocarbons, which were present in the country, were discovered. The most important contribution of ONGC, however, is its self-reliance and development of core competence in E&P activities at a globally competitive level.[9]
ONGC became a publicly held company in February 1994, with 20% of its equity were sold to the public and eighty percent retained by the Indian government. At the time, ONGC employed 48,000 people and had reserves and surpluses worth ₹104.34 billion, in addition to its intangible assets. The corporation's net worth of ₹107.77 billion was the largest of any Indian company.
In 1958 the then Chairman, Keshav Dev Malaviya, held a meeting with some geologists in the Mussoorie office of the Geology Directorate where he accepted the need for ONGC to go outside India too in order to enhance Indian owned capacity for oil production. The argument in support for this step, by LP Mathur and BS Negi, was that Indian demand for crude would go up at a faster rate than discoveries by ONGC in India.
Malaviya followed this up by making ONGC apply for exploration licences in the Persian Gulf. Iran gave ONGC four blocks and Malaviya visited Milan and Bartlseville to request ENI and Phillips Petroleum to join as partners in the Iran venture. This resulted in the discovery of the Rostum oilfield in the early 'sixties, very soon after the discovery of Ankleswar in Gujarat. This was the very first investment by the Indian public sector in foreign countries and oil from Rostum and Raksh was brought to Cochin where it was refined in a refinery built with technical assistance from Phillips.
2000 to present[edit]
In 2003, ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the division of ONGC concerned with its foreign assets, acquired Talisman Energy's 25% stake in the Greater Nile Oil project.[10]
In 2006, a commemorative coin set was issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of ONGC, making it only the second Indian company (State Bank of India being the first) to have such a coin issued in its honor.
In 2011, ONGC applied to purchase 2000 acres of land at Dahanu to process offshore gas.[11] ONGC Videsh, along with Statoil ASA (Norway) and Repsol SA (Spain), has been engaged in deep-water drilling off the northern coast of Cuba in 2012.[12] On 11 August 2012, ONGC announced that it had made a large oil discovery in the D1 oilfield off the west coast of India, which will help it to raise the output of the field from around 12,500 barrels per day (bpd) to a peak output of 60,000 bpd.[13]
In November 2012, OVL agreed to acquire ConocoPhillips' 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan for around US$5 billion, in ONGC's largest acquisition to date.[14] The acquisition is subject to the approval of the governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[15]
In January 2014, OVL and Oil India completed the acquisition of Videocon Group's ten percent stake in a Mozambican gas field for a total of $2.47 billion.[16]
In June 2015, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) gave a Rs27bn ($427m) offshore contract for the Bassein development project to Larsen & Toubro (L&T).[17]
In February 2016, the board of ONGC approved an investment of Rs. 5,050 crore in Tripura for drilling of wells and creation of surface facilities to produce 5.1 million standard cubic feet per day gas from the state's fields.[18]
On 19th July, 2017, the Government of India approved the acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation by ONGC.[19]
Operations[edit]
ONGC's operations include conventional exploration and production, refining and progressive development of alternate energy sources like coal-bed methane and shale gas.[20] The company's domestic operations are structured around 11 assets (predominantly oil and gas producing properties), 7 basins (exploratory properties), 2 plants (at Hazira and Uran) and services (for necessary inputs and support such as drilling, geo-physical, logging and well services).[20]

IOC aims to raise its refining capacity by about 89 percent to 3 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 by setting up new plants and expanding some existing ones, it said. India, the world's third biggest oil consumer, imports about 80 percent of its oil requirements as its local production has not increased for decades. But the country wants to create integrated oil companies with activities both in oil production and refining by combining state-run oil firms. In its quest to become an integrated oil firm, IOC wants to expand its current portfolio of its oil and gas blocks. The refiner has a stake in eight domestic and nine overseas oil and gas blocks in Libya, Gabon, Nigeria, Yemen, Venezuela, Russia, Canada and USA, it said in the annual report.  IOC, the country's largest fuel retailer, controls 50 percent of the downstream marketing infrastructure and is beefing up its sales network to cater to rising fuel demand in India, the world's third biggest oil importer. The refiner owns the largest crude oil and product pipelines network of about 12,848 kilometers and aims to add 8,000 kilometers by 2021. IOC also wants to tap refining and fuel retail opportunities in emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Africa. It is opening offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Bangladesh. IOC currently operates fuel retail and terminal operation in Sri Lanka and Mauritius. To tap India's growing demand for gas, IOC plans to commission its 5 million tonnes a year LNG terminal in southern Indian in 2018-19, the annual report said. Reporting by Nidhi Verma.

S-Oil Corp., Seoul, has let a series of contracts to Axens to supply technology for a residue upgrading and capacity expansion project at its 669,000-b/d Onsan refinery complex in Ulsan, South Korea.
As part of the contracts, Axens will provide technology licenses, basic engineering, catalysts, adsorbents, and proprietary equipment for S-Oil’s residue upgrading complex project (RCUP), which aims to equip the refinery to reduce its production of fuel oil and maximize production of polymer-grade propylene through conversion of atmospheric residue, Axens said.
Axens scope of delivery for RCUP includes the following proprietary technologies:
• A Hyvahl atmospheric residue desulfurization unit for the production of diesel and improvement of residue quality. The Hyvahl unit includes a permutable reactor system, which protects the downstream catalysts by removing or converting a sizeable portion of sediment, metals, and asphaltenes from the feed.
• A high-severity fluidized catalytic cracking (HS-FCC) unit for the conversion of hydrotreated residue produced by the Hyvahl unit. Developed by an alliance of Saudi Aramco, JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp., King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, HS-FCC technology enables higher production yields of propylene than that produced by traditional FCC units through combined use of high reaction temperatures, a novel down-flow reactor concept, short contact times, and high catalyst-to-oil ratio.
• A Sulfrex unsaturated LPG extractive sweetening unit for the treatment of the LPG cut originating from the HS-FCC unit upstream of the polymer-grade propylene recovery process.
The result of a conceptual study conducted by Axens’ performance business program unit, S-Oil’s RCUP scheme will be the world’s first full commercial use of a unit featuring the Axens and Technip Stone & Webster-licensed HS-FCC technology, which alongside increased propylene, also has boosted production of other light, valuable byproducts (e.g., butenes, gasoline, and aromatics) at a semi-commercial HS-FCC plant commissioned in 2011 at JX Nippon Oil & Energy’s Mizushima refinery in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, according to Axens.
In addition to technology for RCUP, S-Oil also contracted Axens to provide the following proprietary technologies as part of the Onsan refinery upgrade:
• A Prime-G+ selective desulfurization unit for the treatment of HS-FCC gasoline production.
• A C4-stream processing section, will include a C4 selective hydrogenation unit, an MTBE unit, a super-fractionator, and a butane isomerization unit. This section will produce MTBE and 1-butene for use as a co-monomer in polymerization applications, as well as isobutane for use as feedstock to an alkylation unit.Values for the technology supply contracts were not disclosed.
S-Oil previously let a contract to Foster Wheeler AG to provide front-end engineering and design for RCUP (OGJ Online, Mar. 12, 2014).
Planned industrial complex
These latest technology contracts to Axens for RCUP follow S-Oil’s contract award to a consortium of South Korea’s Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. and Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. to build S-Oil’s Onsan Industrial Complex (OIC), which will include construction of RCUP as well as an olefins production complex, according to a May 20 release from Daelim.
Construction on OIC, which is S-Oil’s first large-scale investment project since Saudi Aramco subsidiary Aramco Overseas Co. BV took over majority ownership of the firm, is scheduled  to be completed during first-half 2018, the service company said.
While S-Oil has yet to disclose a final investment amount for the RCUP and olefins complex projects, Daelim estimated overall construction costs for the two projects at about 4.5 trillion won ($4.1 billion).
Once completed, the two projects, which are to be constructed simultaneously, will act as an integrated complex, where RCUP will supply its production as feedstock to the downstream olefins plant to provide S-Oil a competitive entry into the olefins business, S-Oil said.
S-Oil previously envisaged mechanical completion of the residue upgrading-olefins integrated project by end-2017, according to the company’s web site.

A New Paradigm Opens: Replacing Low-Voltage, Low-Power Drives with Medium-Voltage Solutions




                                Tue, Jun 20, 2017

This webinar, presented by Siemens, is designed to review the potential benefits and concerns of using either low-voltage or medium-voltage equipment in low-power applications. We will look at areas including planning factors, the impact this equipment will have on a plant, the plant’s power grid, and the potential impact to the motor. We will also look at overall system costs when installing either low- or medium-voltage equipment.
