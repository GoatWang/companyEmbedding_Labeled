	Siam Pan Group Public Company Limited (The) operates in the Petroleum products sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares The Siam Pan Group Public Company Limited with three other
	miscellaneous retailers and wholesalers in Asia:
		
	PetroVietnam Northern Gas JSC
	
		of Vietnam
		(2016
	sales of 2.53 trillion Dong [US$111.11  million]
		),
	
	Sea Oil Pcl
	
		(3.79 billion Thai Bahts [US$113.74  million]
		), and
	
	KUB Malaysia Berhad
	
		which is
		
		based in Malaysia
		(495.77 million Malaysian Ringgits [US$115.78  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	The Siam Pan Group Public Company Limited reported sales of 3.27 billion Thai Bahts (US$98.35 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 3.3%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 3.39 billion Thai Bahts.
	
		The sales level in 2016 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2011, The Siam Pan Group Public Company Limited had sales
		of 3.25 billion Thai Bahts.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 12.7% decline
		in Batteries, from 758.95 million Thai Bahts to 662.60 million Thai Bahts.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Grease (down 1.7% to 954.33 million Thai Bahts)
				
					and
				Others (down 2.1% to 37.20 million Thai Bahts)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Lubricating Oil (up 0.1% to 1.62 billion Thai Bahts)

						distributor for all the three products manufactured by its three subsidiaries. This includes both domestic and
						export sales (mainly to Laos, Cambodia and Burma). SPG utilizes its own sales force in its channel of distribution.
						The subsidiaries also can bypass SPG and deal with the customers directly but only in the case when customers are
						original equipment manufacturing (OEM) - related or are foreign importers.
