Vietnamese businessman selected world Vovinam federation president Vietnamese businessman Mai Huu Tin has been voted the president of the World Vovinam Federation from 2017 to 2022. Mai Huu Tin is new president of the World Vovinam Federation.  Tín, who is also the Viet Nam Vovinam Federation (VVF) president, received support from about 60 delegates from 30 countries and territories who are taking part in the Vovinam World Federation’s Congress which kicked off in New Delhi, India, yesterday. He will be assisted by eight vice presidents, including Nguyen Van Chieu, VVF vice president, Macovei Florin, European Vovinam Federation president, and Djouadi Mohammed, African Vovinam Federation president, during his five-year term. Tín, 48, is the general director and chairman of the board of directors of U&I Investment Corporation. He practices vovinam and won a national title in 1986. On the first day yesterday, the Vovinam Congress also reviewed the development of the martial art with more than two million people around the world practicing it. Delegates discussed plans to make vovinam an official sport at the Asian Games and the Olympics in the future.  Tây Ninh start with draw in U-15 opener Defending champions Hoàng Anh Gia Lai were tied in a 1-1 opener by host Tây Ninh at the National U15 Championship yesterday at the provincial stadium.

[read more]Foreign Investors Keen on M&As With its positive macroeconomic development and political stability, Vietnam is becoming an attractive destination for foreign investors. And, M&As are given priority because this is the quickest method for foreign investors to enter the Vietnamese market.  Improving the environment for better competition According to a research by Jones Lang LaSalle Group (LJJ), macroeconomic indicators, curbed inflation and impressive GDP growth are important factors for investors to consider entering the Vietnamese market. These have helped Vietnam draw a significant value of foreign direct investment (FDI).  The JLL research showed that FDI flows were on the upward trend in the first half of 2017. Vietnam attracted about US$19.2 billion of FDI in the six months, up 54.8 per cent year on year. As such, the country remained one of potential investment destinations in Southeast Asia.  JLL anticipated that the property market will continue to be active and attract foreign investors in 2017, driven by a host of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). In particular, the hotel segment is drawing the greatest interest of foreign investors. This is completely understandable as the tourism industry is thriving on loosened regulations on visa stay and good tourism infrastructure investment.  “We expect this trend will continue in the coming time. Besides, other markets such as industrial zones and education are constantly growing. The affordable housing market is seen as a source of investment capital, largely due to the rise of the middle class,” JJL said.  JJL visited that hundreds of millions of…...

Its outstanding credit balance was nearly VND75.7 trillion ($3.3 billion), an equivalent credit growth rate of 15.7 per cent. Most of VIB’s credit growth derives from retail loans, which rose more than 30 per cent compared to the end of 2016. Thus, while the cap for VIB was 16 per cent for the whole year, VIB’s credit growth has been 15.7 per cent in the first half.  Han Ngoc Vu, general director of VIB, said that the bank proposed SBV to raise the credit growth limit. If the proposal is approved, VIB will have more room for lending, especially at the end of the year when the demand for borrowing usually increases.  After the first six months of 2017, Vietnam Prosperity Joint Stock Commercial Bank (VPBank)’s credit growth rate was 12 per…...

Le Thi Thu Hang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, reiterated at a press briefing on Thursday that Trinh Xuan Thanh, who is accused of gross mismanagement at a subsidiary of national oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, had “turned himself in” to Vietnamese police on Monday after a 10-month international manhunt. A terse statement on the Ministry of Public Security's website, the only official source covering the case in Vietnam, did not reveal why and how Thanh had returned to Vietnam. Minister of Public Security To Lam previously told local media on Sunday that he had no information regarding the case. "Vietnam respects and wants to develop a strategic relationship with Germany," Hang said at the briefing. Germany's foreign ministry said Wednesday it was considering further action to an "unprecedented" breach of German and international law over what it called the abduction of Thanh. The German foreign ministry spokesman said the Vietnamese ambassador had been summoned on Tuesday afternoon and that the official representative of the Vietnamese intelligence service had been ordered to leave, Reuters reported. The ambassador had been told the German government demanded that Trinh Xuan Thanh be allowed to travel back to Germany immediately so his asylum application and a Vietnamese request for his extradition could be examined in full, the…...

At a conference in April, PV Oil considered launching its IPO in late June, as announced on its official news website, PV Oil News. Later, Cao Hoai Duong, general director of PV Oil, told the news agency Bloomberg that the IPO might be postponed until July. However, there is still no more information about the plan until now.  PV Oil is the second largest fuel trader in Vietnam with a market share 22%, just behind Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) with a market share of nearly 50% and about 2,500 gas stations. The IPO plan by PV Oil has drawn great interest from the public and potential investors due to three key reasons. Firstly, Petrolimex, the country’s leading fuel trading firm, has conducted its IPO since April and sold more than 8% of shares for Japanese firm JX Nippon Oil & Energy Secondly, unlike Petrolimex who can sell only 20% of its shares for foreign investors, PV Oil is allowed by the Government to sell up to 65% of its shares for strategic investors, employees and the public. The state will hold only 35% after the equitization. PV Oil’s IPO plan is to sell 49% of…...
