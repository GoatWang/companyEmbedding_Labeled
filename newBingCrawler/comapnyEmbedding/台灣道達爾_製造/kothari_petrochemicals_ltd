Kothari Petrochemicals Launches New Plant; Doubles Production
 
Chennai, May 1st, 2008
 
Kothari Petrochemicals, Ltd., India’s largest producer of polyisobutene (PIB), has commissioned its second plant at Manali, Tamil Nadu, India, bringing its total production capacity to 22,000 MT per annum, double the size of its nearest Indian competitor.
 
"The worldwide growth in demand for PIB and proximity to one of India’s largest ports made our existing complex the ideal location for expansion. Our strategic investment is one of many steps we have taken to establish a truly global brand for our petrochemical company,” stated B.H. Kothari, Chairman and Managing Director of the HC Kothari Group of Companies.
 
The new plant will produce polyisobutene (PIB), which is an advanced polymer having high export value. Its demand worldwide continues to grow due to the ever-increasing need for cleaner, non-toxic, efficient and longer-lasting polymers in a wide range of applications and industries, such as manufacturing, lubrication additives, adhesives, paints, coatings, electrical insulation and cling wrap.
 
Kothari is India’s only PIB manufacturer to supply to large multinationals, such as Castrol, Exxon, Mobil, Infineum and Chevron,, due to the high quality and consistency of its product. An upgraded state of the art research center, control room and storage enable the world-standard delivery from Kothari’s 20-acre combined facility in Manali.
 
The expanded facility has provided employment for approximately 80 people. With continued growth and a recent restructuring effort to strengthen the company’s global competitiveness, employment opportunities have expanded to include management, sales, administrative and plant personnel. Interested candidates may apply online at hr@hckgroup.com
