About









BioAmber is a next  generation chemistry company with a  portfolio of renewable chemicals.  Its  proprietary technology platform combines industrial biotechnology, an  innovative purification process and chemical catalysis to convert renewable  feedstocks into chemicals for use in a wide variety of everyday products. 
BioAmber offers a portfolio of  renewable chemicals based on succinic acid and other C4 chemicals, including 1,4-Butane Diol (BDO) and esters of  succinic acid, as well as a new biopolymer platform based on the modified  polybutylene succinate biopolymer (mPBS).  mPBS is biodegradable and will be >50%  renewable with biobased succinic acid and 100% renewable with bio-BDO.  mPBS can be used at higher heat distortion temperatures,  has better strength and stiffness and drop-in processability for extrusion and  injection molding.  BioAmber is also  developing a C6 Platform that will  provide biobased Adipic Acid, Caprolactam and HMDA. 
BioAmber operates the world’s only large-scale bio-based succinic acid  plant today, which is located in Europe and has an annual production of 3,000  tons.  
BioAmber is a private, US company with a global presence, based in  Minnesota, USA.  In addition to the  European plant, BioAmber will start building its first North American plant in  Sarnia, Ontario, together with Mitsui & Co. in 2011.  The Sarnia plant will be commissioned in 2013  with an initial capacity of 17,000 tons of biobased succinic acid, which will  be increased to 35,000 tons at peak production, along with 23,000 tons of  biobased-1,4-BDO.  
A second large-scale commercial plant is planned with Mitsui & Co.,  in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, as part of an agreement with PTTMCC Biochem.  The Thai plant is expected to come on stream  in 2014, and will have a capacity of 65,000 tons of biobased succinic acid and  50,000 tons of biobased BDO by 2016.  A  third plant in North America or Brazil is planned in partnership with Mitsui  & Co. which will bring BioAmber’s combined capacity to 165,000 tons/year  for biobased succinic acid and 23,000 tons/year for biobased BDO.
BioAmber's business model  is based on open innovation and partnerships, which have enabled it to be first  to market with biobased succinic acid.   BioAmber’s partnerships extend across the value chain for renewable raw  materials, including Mitsui & Co.,  Mitsubishi Chemical, Lanxess, DuPont, Cargill, Celexion and Matric, amongst  others.

					Full Description



BioAmber Inc. (BioAmber), formerly DNP Green Technology, Inc., incorporated on October 15, 2008, is an industrial biotechnology company, which produces sustainable chemicals. The Company's technology platform combines industrial biotechnology and chemical catalysis to convert renewable feedstocks into sustainable chemicals that are replacements for petroleum-derived chemicals, which are used in a range of everyday products, including plastics, resins, food additives and personal care products. Its geographical segments include Europe and North America. The Company sells its product, bio-succinic acid, to customers in a range of chemical markets. Bio-succinic acid is a biologically produced, chemically identical replacement for petroleum-derived succinic acid that can be utilized to produce derivative products, such as bio-based 1,4 Butanediol (1,4 BDO), and can substitute petrochemicals, such as maleic anhydride, phthalic acid and adipic acid in various applications. Its bio-based specialty chemicals can be used in multiple end-markets and applications, and serves as building blocks for a range of products used every day. Bio-succinic acid is used in various applications, including plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings, de-icing and coolant solutions, fine chemicals and lubricants, as well as anti-freeze solutions, coolants solvents, water treatment chemicals, laundry tablets and bath salts, artificial leather products, and foams made with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET).The Company is engaged in developing over three distinct technologies, such as the production of succinic acid through fermentation; the conversion of succinic acid into 1,4 BDO, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) by catalyst assisted hydrogenation reaction, and the production of adipic acid and other C6 chemical intermediates through fermentation and purification with or without catalytic conversion. The Company produces bio-succinic acid in a facility located in Sarnia, Ontario, which has a production capacity of over 30,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid per year. Its product pipeline includes derivatives of bio-succinic acid and C6 building block chemicals. The derivatives of bio-succinic acid include 1,4 BDO and THF, and succinic acid-based polyesters. The uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics.PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines mechanical and electrical properties with chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Polybutylene succinate (PBS) is a biodegradable polymer made by reacting succinic acid with 1,4 BDO and its applications range from single use in food service ware, including cutlery, cups and lids, agricultural mulching film and compostable bags. PBS is also used in combination with other biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), and with petrochemical polymers, such as polypropylene, polystyrene and polycarbonate. The C6 building block chemicals include adipic acid, which is primarily used in the production of Nylon 6,6 fibers, plastics and resins; caprolactam, which is an intermediate used in the production of Nylon 6, and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), which is an intermediate used to produce Nylon 6,6. The C6 building block chemicals are used in carpets, engineering plastics, textiles and fibers, films and polyurethanes.

History[edit]
BioAmber was established in 2008 as a result of a spin-off from New York-based Diversified Natural Products (DNP). The company was originally named DNP Green Technology and was based in Princeton, New Jersey.[5] Prior to the spin-off, DNP had established a joint venture with France-based Agro-Industrie Recherches et Développements (ARD) to develop and commercialize bio-based succinic acid. In 2010, DNP Green Technology acquired 100 percent of the joint venture from ARD and changed its corporate name to BioAmber.[6]
After the Company was spun off from DNP, it was privately financed in 2009 by a group of institutional investors led by Sofinnova Partners, Mitsui & Co., Samsung Ventures and the Cliffton Group.[7] In 2011 and 2012, Naxos Capital Partners and Lanxess became investors in the Company, which raised a total of $87 million over three rounds of financing between 2009[8] and 2012.[9] In May 2013, BioAmber completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BIOA, raising $80 million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional $44 million in common stock.[10]
Technology[edit]
BioAmber produces bio-based succinic acid by fermenting sugars. The company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from Cargill. Cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low pH. Cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since 2009.[11] BioAmber collaborated with Cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low pH and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid, giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation. BioAmber has designed its commercial plant in Sarnia for the production of bio-based succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology.[12]
BioAmber has licensed from Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies a catalyst technology that converts bio-based succinic acid into bio-based 1,4-butanediol (BDO).[13] The technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into BDO and tetrahydrofuran (THF).[14] JM Davy is reportedly the global leader in BDO and THF technology, with 14 licenses deployed representing approximately 800,000 tons per year of installed BDO and THF capacity, or 25% of worldwide capacity.[15] Their technology currently produces BDO/THF from maleic anhydride, a petrochemical. The first step in that route converts MA to succinic acid; thus succinic is an alternative feedstock. JM Davy has adjusted its process and tested BioAmber's bio-succinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance, process economics or product quality.[15]
Sustainability[edit]
The use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals.
Manufacturing[edit]
BioAmber produced bio-based succinic acid from January 2010 to December 2014 at a large demonstration plant owned and operated by the Company’s former joint venture partner, ARD.[16] The demonstration plant operated at the 350,000 liter fermenter scale, which at the time was one of the largest scale fermentations among start-up companies in the field of bio-based chemicals.[17] BioAmber claim to have gained extensive experience from operating this plant for five years and incorporated the learning and improvements into the design of its commercial plant in Sarnia, Canada.[18]
BioAmber established a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. to build and operate a bio-succinic acid plant in Sarnia, Ontario with a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 metric tons (66,000,000 lb) per year,[19] with BioAmber owning 60% of the venture.[20] The facility began construction in August 2013 and began commercial operations in November 2015.[21] The cost of construction was US$141 million and it created 60 full-time jobs.[21] It is the world’s largest bio-based succinic acid plant.[22]
BioAmber's Integrated Management Systems in Sarnia were ISO 9001:2008 registered, ISO 14001:2004 registered, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 registered, and FSSC 22000 registered within four months of operational start-up.[23]
Markets[edit]
Succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets, from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives, to large volume applications such as bioplastics, pigments, plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings.[24] In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) published a report on “Top Value-Added Chemicals from Biomass,” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass. The study prioritized twelve chemicals, from a group of over 300 possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars. Bio-succinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential.[25]
Historically, the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients. As a result, based on 2011 estimates, the market for petroleum-based succinic acid was approximately 51,000 metric tons per year, representing a market size of approximately $350 million.[24] However, market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing bio-succinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications. A study published in September 2013 by Transparency Market Research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a CAGR of 19.4% between 2012 and 2018.[26] A study published in August 2012 by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 25% and 30% through 2020, when the global market size is expected to be between 500,000 and 700,000 metric tons.[24]
The major uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT.[27] THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics. PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines excellent mechanical and electrical properties with robust chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Global 1,4-butanediol market size was estimated at US$4.72 billion in 2013.[28]

Bio-based 1,4Butanediol




A GREEN VERSION OF A WIDELY USED CHEMICAL THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE
BioAmber can transform its bio-based Succinic acid into 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a single catalytic step. BDO and THF are used to make engineering plastics, polyurethanes, biodegradable polyesters, spandex and other specialty chemicals.  We make exactly the same chemical. It is a straight drop in for existing BDO and THF consumers, but is bio-based, rather than being petroleum based, providing the products made with our BDO and THF a better environmental footprint.

Bio-basedDisodiumSuccinate




AN ALL NATURAL SEASONING AND FLAVOR ENHANCER FOR USE IN FOODS
BioAmber bio-based disodium succinate is an important ingredient of complex seasoning agents that can be used as an alternative for flavor enhancement and salt replacement. For its production, BioAmber's natural flavor grade bio-based succinic acid is neutralized and spray dried to a tight particle size distribution. This natural ingredient can be used with other flavors and enhancers to either intensify flavor or soften stimulating strong tastes. It has good water solubility and high penetration and as a result, these effects are accelerated. BioAmber’s bio-based disodium succinate is an anhydrous powder with low particle size, making it ideal for blending in dry seasonings.

Sustainability Life Cycle Analysis
A Carbon Neutral Footprint


BioAmber is committed to producing chemicals in a more environmentally responsible manner.  By using renewable feedstock, eliminating green house gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption, we are practicing greener chemistry that is sustainable.  When our Sarnia plant begins production in 2015, it will have an impressive carbon footprint relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum.   Our bio-based process for making succinic acid will result in a 100% reduction in green house gas emissions and a 60% reduction in energy consumption. 

An independent life cycle analysis, which evaluated the entire production chain from the planting and harvesting of corn through to the purification of succinic acid, revealed that net green house gas emissions for our entire process is zero.  This represents a 100% reduction relative to the 7.1 tons of greenhouse gases that are emitted per ton of succinic acid produced using the petroleum process.   At full capacity (30,000 tons of succinic acid per year), our Sarnia facility will reduce green house gas emissions by over 210,000 tons per year, relative to the petroleum process.  This is the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road each year.  The life cycle analysis also revealed that our entire process (corn to succinic) uses 60% less energy than the petroleum-derived process, a savings of over 2 trillion BTUs per year.  That is the equivalent to the energy consumed by 46,000 US homes annually.

Sustainability feedstock development
Feedstock Flexibility


BioAmber is focused on using the most abundant, low cost sugar available, but we are also conscious of the need to be as sustainable as possible. Today, North American corn offers the most competitively priced sugar, making our succinic acid even more cost competitive.  We can also use sugar from cane, beets, sorghum, wheat and tapioca to produce succinic acid.  Our longer-term goal is to move to agricultural, forestry and eventually industrial waste as alternatives to traditional sugars.

While these second and third generation sugars are not commercially available today, BioAmber is working to ensure it has the flexibility to move to these alternative feedstocks when they become economical and available in commercial quantities.  Our proprietary yeast developed with Cargill has the ability to efficiently consume xylose, the principal sugar that is obtained from hemi-cellulose, a major component of agricultural and forestry waste.  We are actively screening sugars produced by various new technologies in an effort to determine those that will offer legitimate alternatives to first generation sugars.  We are also engaged in a research program with Canada’s National Research Counsel that is developing a new organism that can consume methane or methanol instead of sugar and produce succinic acid.  Methane and methanol are expected to be widely available and inexpensive byproducts of the shale gas boom.

How We Make It


We use renewable feedstocks (sugars) instead of fossil fuels and apply industrial biotechnology (fermentation) using our proprietary yeast, which consumes sugar and CO2 to produce succinic acid. We then recover and purify the succinic acid and use conventional chemistry to convert the succinic acid into 1,4 Butanediol and disodium succinate.




We can use any type of sugar (C6 or C5) as feedstock
Our yeast is very efficient at producing succinic acid
CO2 is our other feedstock – providing roughly 25% of the carbon in succinic acid
Our succinic acid is 100% bio-based
