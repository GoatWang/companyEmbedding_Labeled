PBF Energy (NYSE: PBF) is a petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, lubricants, petrochemical feedstocks, and other petroleum products founded in 2008 with headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey. The company's refineries include facilities in Chalmette, Louisiana, Toledo, Ohio, Port of Paulsboro in Gibbstown, New Jersey, the Delaware City Refinery in Delaware City, and the former ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California. PBF produces a range of products including gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), heating oil, jet fuel, lubricants, petrochemicals and asphalt.[1][2][3]
PBF was formed in 2008 as a joint venture by Petroplus Holdings and the private equity companies Blackstone Group and First Reserve, each committing $667 million in equity.[4] In September 2010 Petroplus announced plans to sell its 32.62 percent stake to its partners for $91 million as PBF acquired the Paulsboro refinery from Valero Energy.[5][6] PBF then acquired the Toledo refinery from Sunoco in December 2010 for approximately $400 million.[7] PBF went public in December 2012 with a $533 million initial public offering.[8]
In 2015 PBF acquired the 189,000 BPD Chalmette, Louisiana refinery from ExxonMobil and its partner, the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, for $322 million, in a deal that included interests in chemical facilities, pipelines and other assets at the site located just ten minutes from downtown New Orleans.[9]
In July 2016, PBF acquired the 155,000 BPD ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California for $537.5M. The acquisition included ownership interests in several crude gathering and transportation pipelines, product pipelines, products terminals and crude and products storage facilities, and increased PBF's total throughput capacity to approximately 900,000 barrels per day, making it the fourth largest independent refiner in North America.[10]
PBF's refineries in Paulsboro (NJ) and Delaware City (DE) have been cited by environmentalists for processing crude oil from the Amazon River Basin in South America. In 2015, the Delaware City refinery was processing more than 3,300 barrels per day of crude originating in the Amazon.[11] Medical acronyms 1. PBF= Peripheral blood film
