Petrochemical
Our products are processed under constant scrutiny to achieve finished petrochemical products meeting or exceeding exacting ASTM standards. We offer the highest quality isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane, petroleum ether, isohexane and hexane available anywhere. Our Statistical Process Control (SPC) program permeates through all phases of our products’ movement. Samples are tested during and after processing and in the tank trucks and railcars loaded for delivery.
South Hampton Resources’ top management is located at the facility to make decisions which allow us to react quickly and appropriately.  As the demands of industry change or the specifications for our products evolve, we are able to adapt immediately.
Unsurpassed quality is matched by unequaled response to our customers’ delivery requirements.
Each product South Hampton produces has its own fully dedicated system. From start to finish, pipelines, distillation columns, storage tanks, tank trucks, and railcars are reserved for specific products and are not routinely switched from one service to another.
Customized loading procedures maintain the integrity of our products, whether they go by our trucks and railcars or the customers’. Nitrogen purging is also available prior to loading to further ensure product integrity.
Our toll processing customers receive the same unparalleled service as our petrochemical customers. We store their end products in dedicated tanks for future delivery rather than insisting they take immediate delivery upon completion of the process.
South Hampton’s toll processing capabilities have been recognized as superior by many of the country’s leading petrochemical manufacturers. Reasons for this are unmatched flexibility, speed of implementation, and cost effectiveness.
Our wide array of existing equipment is quickly reconfigured to match process specifications precisely. Our Statistical Process Control (SPC) program monitors the work in progress continuously throughout the product’s dedicated system.
The end benefit is new a product being brought to market at a fraction of the cost and time than if it had been processed at the customer’s facility; or, on the other hand, the rapid realization that an unproven procedure will not yield the required design performance. Lowering our customers’ financial risk and allowing a greater return on their investment are bottom line reasons for our growth in the toll processing arena.

South Hampton Resources is an independent, petrochemical manufacturer in southeast Texas. Since its beginning in 1955 it has progressed through several stages to emerge as a strongly competitive specialty petrochemical processor.
With over 55 years of experience the company is now the industry leader in product quality and service to the customer.
Quality is the focal point of South Hampton. Since July of 1987 all our products have been produced under Statistical Process Control (SPC) to ensure the highest quality and consistency. Testing of the feedstock, intermediate, and final products is done meticulously in our own laboratories at each stage of the manufacturing and delivery process.
A smaller but historically steady segment of the business has been the toll processing and product development work that has been done for others in the industry. The wide variety of available equipment and the ready source of good quality hydrogen has enabled South Hampton Resources to assist others with their particular needs. Past and present customers include almost every major oil company and many chemical companies. South Hampton is known for its ability to act quickly and for its flexibility in meeting the customer's needs.

Trecora Resources, incorporated on May 4, 1967, is engaged in the manufacturing of specialty petrochemical products and synthetic waxes, and providing custom processing services. The Company operates through two segments: the manufacturing of various specialty petrochemical products and the manufacturing of specialty synthetic waxes. The specialty petrochemical products segment operates through South Hampton Resources, Inc. (SHR). The specialty synthetic wax segment operates through Trecora Chemical, Inc. (TC). The Company also owns interests in Al Masane Al Kobra Mining Company (AMAK), a Saudi Arabian closed joint stock mining company, which is in commercial production of copper and zinc concentrate, and interests in Pioche Ely Valley Mines, Inc. (PEVM), a Nevada mining corporation, which presently does not conduct any business activity but owns undeveloped properties in the United States. The Company's petrochemical operations are primarily conducted through a subsidiary, Texas Oil and Chemical Co. II, Inc. (TOCCO). TOCCO owns interests in SHR and TC.SHR owns and operates a specialty petrochemical facility near Silsbee, Texas which produces high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products, including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging, polypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. Its petrochemical products are transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container, and by ship. SHR owns all of the capital stock of Gulf State Pipe Line Co, Inc. (GSPL), which owns and operates pipelines that connect the SHR facility to a natural gas line, to SHR's truck and rail loading terminal and to a petroleum products pipeline owned by an unaffiliated third party. SHR also provides custom processing services.SHR's specialty petrochemical facility is approximately 30 miles north of Beaumont and 90 miles east of Houston. The facility consists of eight operating units which, while interconnected, make distinct products through differing processes: a Penhex Unit; a Reformer Unit; a Cyclo-pentane Unit; an Aromax Unit; an Aromatics Hydrogenation Unit; a White Oil Fractionation Unit; a Hydrocarbon Processing Demonstration Unit, and a P-Xylene Unit. As of December 31, 2016, the Penhex Unit has the capacity to process approximately 11,000 barrels per day of fresh feed, with the Reforming Unit, the Aromax Unit, and the Cyclo-Pentane Unit further processing streams produced by the Penhex Unit. As of December 31, 2016, the Aromatics Hydrogenation Unit had a capacity of approximately 400 barrels per day, and the White Oils Fractionation Unit had a capacity of approximately 3,000 barrels per day. As of December 31, 2016, the Hydrocarbon Processing Demonstration Unit had a capacity of approximately 300 gallons per day. As of December 31, 2016, the P-Xylene Unit has a capacity of approximately 20,000 pounds per year. The Company produces eight product streams and markets various combinations of blends.TC produces specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes, and provides custom processing services from its approximately 20 acres plant located in Pasadena, Texas. TC provides custom manufacturing, distillation, blending, forming, and packaging of finished and intermediate products, and wax products for coatings, hot melt adhesives and lubricants. The Company manufactures a range of hard, high melting point, low to medium viscosity polyethylene wax products along with a range of other waxes and lubricants. These products are used in a range of applications, including performance additives for hot melt adhesives; penetration and melting point modifiers for paraffin and microcrystalline waxes; lubrication and processing aides for plastics, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and rubber, and dry stir-in additives for inks. In oxidized forms, applications also include use in textile emulsions and lubricants in PVC extrusion. TC also provides turnkey custom manufacturing services, including quality assurance, transportation and process optimization. The plant has vacuum distillation capability for the separation of temperature sensitive materials.

SUGAR LAND, Texas, June 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Trecora Resources (NYSE:   TREC), a leading provider of high purity specialty hydrocarbons and waxes, announced today that it has initiated production at the recently acquired BASF plant adjacent to Trecora Chemical (TC) in Pasadena, Texas. The first production run is a new high purity specialty wax product that could not be handled at TC due to capacity constraints.


Dr. Peter Loggenberg, President of Trecora Chemical, commented, "The BASF facility, which we refer to as 'B Plant,' is being integrated with our TC facility, and we are pleased to be generating revenue within just a few weeks of the acquisition. With B Plant online, we are reviewing several projects that could drive additional revenue this year for TC while also gaining significant operating efficiencies." 
B Plant includes production equipment that is similar to TC's plus equipment that broadens TC's capabilities and potential markets. The 6.5-acre site also includes substantial storage capacity, several rail and truck loading sites and utility tie-ins to TC.

SUGAR LAND, Texas, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Trecora Resources (NYSE: TREC) a leading provider of high purity specialty hydrocarbons and waxes, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017."We are off to a solid start in 2017 as we continue to make progress on our capital projects and prepare the company for long-term growth and profitability," said Simon Upfill-Brown, President and CEO.  "Our revenue increased 6.4% as a result of higher petrochemical prices and continued revenue growth at Trecora Chemical (TC), while prime product sales were impacted by lower volumes from our Canadian Oil Sands customer.  Excluding the impact on volume from that particular customer, our prime product volume grew a healthy 7.6% year-over-year.  We anticipate modest volume growth in the second half of 2017 and remain well positioned for greater growth in 2018 as our new capital projects come online to take advantage of the resurgence in the North American chemical industry."We were especially pleased to report another strong quarter at TC driven by a 42.8% year-over-year increase in wax sales and a 13.5% increase on a sequential basis, demonstrating the upward trend we are realizing from this business," continued Upfill-Brown. "We continue to gain approvals of our higher quality wax products and make inroads in our target markets as we shipped quantities of our new Hot Melt Adhesives product to two local customers and have three others working on approval.  With our distillation unit online and generating revenues in April, combined with the startup of the hydrogenation unit expected to occur later this month, we expect additional revenue contributions from these projects for the remainder of 2017."Finally, with the AMAK mine once again operational, we milled 61,000 tons during the quarter.  Although averaging about a third of our target throughput for the mill in the quarter, production was on a solid upward trend. Sales of gold and silver doré contributed to reducing the equity losses we have recently experienced," said Upfill-Brown. "We expect exploration results and mining options for the initial work at Guyan next quarter, with additional drilling set to start in the third quarter, along with a life of mine update for the copper and zinc assets also expected in the third quarter."First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsTotal revenue in the first quarter was $55.5 million compared with $52.2 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.4%.  The increase in reported revenue was driven by a 23.0% increase in the average sales price of petrochemical products, partially offset by a 14.9% decrease in petrochemical sales volume, compared with the first quarter of 2016. The higher average sales price was partially offset by a 34.1% year-over-year increase in the average per-gallon cost of petrochemical feedstock which is the basis for the formula pricing for about 60% of the Company's petrochemical product sales.  Average feedstock cost per gallon increased approximately 6.0% compared to fourth quarter of 2016 including the impact of minimum volume penalty fees.  Since formula pricing is based upon prior month feedstock averages, sales price increases tend to lag higher feedstock costs resulting in lower profit margins.  Gross profit in the first quarter was $10.6 million, or 19.1% of total revenues, compared with $11.8 million, or 22.5% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2016.  Operating income for the first quarter was $4.2 million, compared with operating income of $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2016.Net income for the first quarter was $1.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with $7.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.1 million, or $0.08 per share1. Reported net income in the first quarter of 2017 reflected equity in loss of AMAK of $1.0 million, or an estimated $0.03 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. Net income in the first quarter of 2016 reflected equity in earnings AMAK of $5.4 million, or an estimated $0.14 per diluted share on an after-tax basis.1 Based on adjusted net income of $2.1 million and 25.1 million shares outstanding.Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $7.4 million, representing a 13.3% margin, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million and a 17.6% margin in the year-ago period.South Hampton ResourcesPetrochemical volume in the first quarter was 17.3 million gallons, compared with 20.4 million gallons in the first quarter of 2016. Prime product volume in the first quarter of 2017 was 13.9 million gallons, compared with 14.6 million gallons in the first quarter of 2016.  Byproduct volume, which is sold at significantly lower margins than prime products, decreased 12.7% sequentially and 40.2% year-over-year, to 3.4 million gallons. Byproduct prices were higher year-over-year and from the fourth quarter of 2016.International volume represented 19.6% of total petrochemical volume during the quarter, down from 22.7% sequentially and 20.7% from the first quarter of 2016.SHR SEGMENT INFORMATION*THREE MONTHS ENDEDMARCH 31,20172016% Change  Product sales$44,391$42,6244%  Processing fees1,4881,4413%  Net revenues$45,879$44,0654%  Operating profit before depreciation and amortization8,2148,412(2%)  Operating profit6,6587,075(6%)  Depreciation and amortization1,5561,33716%  EBITDA8,0408,413(4%)  Capital expenditures$  8,756$  5,66255%  *Dollar amounts in thousands/rounding may applyTrecora ChemicalIn the first quarter, TC generated revenues of $9.7 million, up 18.8% from $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter revenues were the highest of any quarter since TC was acquired in 2014.  TC revenue included $6.5 million of wax product sales, up 42.8%, and $3.2 million of custom processing fees, lower by 11.8%, both compared with the first quarter of 2016.  In the first quarter of 2016, custom processing fees included, for the last time, $1.7 million that were recognized for annual equipment non-use fees. The distillation portion of the hydrogenation/distillation unit project at TC is now operational and starting to contribute revenue.  Start up of the hydrogenation section continues to make progress with completion expected during the second quarter.  Once fully operational, this unit will provide TC with new capabilities to leverage relationships with existing petrochemical customers and drive new custom processing revenue. EBITDA in the first quarter was $0.7 million, compared with $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2016.TC SEGMENT INFORMATION*THREE MONTHS ENDEDMARCH 31,20172016% Change  Product sales$6,508$4,55743%  Processing fees3,1553,578(12%)  Net revenues$9,663$8,13519%  Operating profit before depreciation and amortization7452,062(64%)  Operating profit (loss)(271)1,011(127%)  Depreciation and amortization1,0161,051(3%)  EBITDA7262,057(65%)  Capital expenditures$ 5,125$  1,940164%  *Dollar amounts in thousands/rounding may applyAl Masane Al Kobra Mining Company (AMAK)Trecora reported equity in losses of AMAK of approximately $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2017.  Operations are improving according to schedule.  Although there were no copper or zinc concentrate sales in the period, some inventory was built at the port.  Guyan exploration results as well as exploration results extending the life of the copper and zinc mine assets are expected in coming quarters.  Additional drilling expected to start in the third quarter of 2017 in Al Aqiq, which is adjacent to Guyan and possesses similar geology.Earnings CallToday's conference call and presentation slides will be simulcast live on the Internet, and can be accessed on the investor relations section of the Company's website at http://www.trecora.com or at http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=123905.

TREC: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 05/31/2017 settlement date, and Trecora Resources is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 18.60 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.01. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
