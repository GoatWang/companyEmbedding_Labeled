Ryazan Energy Retail Co.: Gathering momentum, can it sustain its performance? 
August 15, 2016 by CapitalCube 


Ryazan Energy Retail Co. relative valuation is OVERVALUED and it has a fundamental analysis score of 66.
Our analysis is based on comparing Ryazan Energy Retail Co. with the following peers – Perm Energy Retail Company OAO, Chelyabenergosbyt PAO Pref.Shs, Vladimir Energy Retail Company OJSC, Lipetsk Power Sale Co. OJSC, Mordovia Energy Retail Co., Kostroma Power Sale Company OJSC and TNS energo Nizhny Novgorod PJSC Pref (PMSB-RU, CLSBP-RU, VDSB-RU, LPSB-RU, MRSB-RU, KTSB-RU and NNSBP-RU).
Ryazan Energy Retail Co. has shown excellent performance overall, both over the last one year as well as over the last month. In fact, Ryazan Energy Retail Co.’s price momentum over the last month, at 13.21% has been better than that over the last year, which was 11.63%. Also from a peer group perspective, Ryazan Energy Retail Co. has performed better, since the peer group performance was 6.64% over the last month.

Company Snapshot

Compared to peers, relative underperformance over the last year is in contrast with the more recent outperformance.


Ryazan Energy Retail Co.’s current Price/Book of 1.28 is about median in its peer group.


The market expects faster earnings growth from RZSB-RU than from its peers and also a turnaround in its current ROE.


RZSB-RU has relatively low net profit margins while its asset efficiency is relatively high.


The company’s year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group.


Over the last five years, RZSB-RU‘s return on assets has eroded from above median to below median among its peers suggesting declining relative operating performance.


Company appears to give away relatively high gross margins to relatively high operating costs suggesting a differentiated product portfolio with low pre-tax margins relative to peers.


Compared with the peers chosen, RZSB-RU has had faster revenue growth in prior years and a current P/E ratio that suggests faster growth in the future suggesting superior growth expectations.


The company’s capital investment program suggests it is under-investing in a business that is producing peer median returns.


RZSB-RU currently does not have any debt.


Our analysis rates Ryazan Energy Retail Co. as OVERVALUED relative to its peers.


Share Price Performance
Compared to peers, relative underperformance over the last year is in contrast with the more recent outperformance.
RZSB-RU‘s share price performance of 11.63% over the last 12 months is below its peer median but its 30-day trend in share price performance of 13.21% is better than the peer median. This recent rising stock price may herald a change in relative share price performance.
